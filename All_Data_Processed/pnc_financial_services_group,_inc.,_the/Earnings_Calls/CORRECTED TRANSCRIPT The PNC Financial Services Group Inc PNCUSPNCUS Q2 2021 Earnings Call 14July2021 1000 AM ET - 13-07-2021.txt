over to bill the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen we accomplished a lot in the second quarter and most important was the closing of the acquisition of bbva usa on june obviously this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results adding one month of bbva usa operating results and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as mergerrelated impacts and robs going to take you through all of that in a couple of minutes but putting those things aside we had a pretty good quarter driven by solid net interest income strong fee growth continued improvements in credit quality and announcement of higher capital returns while loans increased primarily due to the acquisition we did have spot loan growth in both consumer and ci in the legacy pnc balance sheet weve seen loan utilization rates stabilize within our corporate institutional banking business however they remain near historic lows and while new loan approvals have rebounded actually to the highest level in a couple of years thats been offset by continued paydowns within the pnc legacy consumer book we saw loans grow in the quarter which was encouraging and were confident that strong economic growth is ultimately going to drive strong loan growth but it remains an open debate as to the timing of that loan growth relative to the second half of and into during the quarter we continued to deploy excess liquidity through billion of net security purchases going forward and considering the significant recent rally in treasuries well be disciplined as we look to reduce our elevated cash position you saw that our recent ccar results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders following the results we announced a increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and a billion share repurchase program importantly were well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our customers and invest in our businesses regarding bbva i couldnt be more pleased with where we are pnc and bbva employees have hit the ground running and are making great progress in preparing for a successful conversion and integration the deal significantly expands our footprint gives us access to of the top msas across the country with a coastto coast franchise and it provides us with an opportunity for growth for years to come all of our original deal metrics are the same or better than we estimated and robs going to take you through those and finally the underlying growth opportunities in the new markets are outstanding across this footprint employees are making joint calls and we are seeing deal pipelines build especially as we present our enhanced capabilities and scale of the new markets we continue to believe the revenue synergy opportunity is significant as we look to drive bbva usas noninterest income contribution to total revenue closer to legacy pncs mid level on the integration front were leveraging our past investments in technology and automation to expedite the process drive synergies and reduce complexity removing the data from more than bbva usa applications to pnc applications taking a liftandshift approach that allows us to simplify the customer conversion i also want to mention that our continued rollout of low cash mode which was available to million virtual wallet customers as of the end of june were planning to roll it out to the remaining million virtual wallet customers by the end of this month and look forward to making it available to bbva customers upon conversion later this year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 since announcing the product in april weve delivered over million low cash mode alerts and have seen strong engagement with the experiences that helps to address a major frustration for many of our customers across the industry over time we expect it to drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships as we execute our national expansion strategy finally id like to close by thanking our legacy pnc and the new bbva usa employees for all of their hard work that allowed us to close this deal early and prepare for conversion and longterm success and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter we successfully completed our acquisition of bbva usa significantly expanding our footprint which now includes growth markets throughout the sunbelt region our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on a spot basis while we typically cover our average balance sheets well focus this quarter on spot balances due to the timing of the june closing of the acquisition overall linked quarter balance sheet growth was driven by the acquisition of course which contributed billion in loans billion of investment securities and billion of deposits at quarter end excluding those additions during the quarter legacy pnc loan balances declined billion investment securities increased billion and deposits declined by billion and ill cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides we ended the quarter with a tangible book value of per share and an estimated cet1 ratio of substantially above the levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement as a result were well positioned with significant capital flexibility and as bill just mentioned we recently announced a increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to per share additionally we reinstated our share repurchase programs of up to billion for the fourth quarter period beginning in the third quarter of slide shows our periodend loans and deposits accounting for the acquisition and highlighting the relative contributions total loans were billion at quarter end and with the acquisition our loan mix remains consistent at approximately twothirds commercial and onethird consumer total deposits were billion at june and our rates paid on interestbearing deposits is now basis points a basis point decline linked quarter taking a closer look at loans commercial loan balances of billion increased billion bbva contributed billion and spot pnc legacy growth of approximately billion was offset by a billion decline in ppp loans consumer loans were up billion represented by billion of acquired loans as well as growth in legacy pnc consumer loans primarily in the residential real estate portfolio the yield on loan balances was stable at compared to the first quarter and reflected the combined loan portfolio slide details the change in our spot securities and federal reserve balances over the past year securities balances were billion at the end of the second quarter a billion increase linked quarter due to the addition of billion of securities from the acquisition and billion in net purchases our fed cash balances decreased billion linked quarter reflecting continued deployment into securities and the payment of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 billion for the acquisition despite the linked quarter decline our liquidity position remains in excess of our lcr requirements as you can see on slide our second quarter income statement includes the impact of the acquisition our reported eps was which included an initial provision for bbva usa of billion and integration costs of million adjusted for these items eps was in the second quarter second quarter revenue was billion up million compared with the first quarter reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth expenses increased million or linked quarter including million of significant items related to integration expenses and litigation reserves as well as one month of bbva operating expenses and higher legacy pnc business activity the provision of million included a provision recapture of million related to improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors as well as balance reductions which was more than offset by billion initial provision in connection with the acquisition as a result total net income was billion in the second quarter now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide these charts illustrate our diversified business mix with noninterest income representing of total revenue in the second quarter net interest income of billion was up million or and net interest margin of was up basis points both of which reflect the impact of the acquisition second quarter fee income of billion increased million or linked quarter within that legacy pnc fees grew by million and bbva usas one month of operations contributed million taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories asset management revenue increased million or as a result of higher average equity markets consumer services fees grew million or primarily due to increased transaction volume and higher merchant services revenue corporate services increased million or driven by higher ma advisory activity and treasury management product revenue service charges on deposits grew million or due to the addition of bbva usa other noninterest income of million declined million linked quarter and included a negative visa derivative adjustment lower securities gains as well as higher private equity revenue in total noninterest income of billion increased million or compared to the first quarter driven primarily by legacy pnc fee growth as well as million of noninterest income from the acquisition turning to slide our second quarter expenses were up by million or linked quarter and included million of significant items related to integration expenses and the addition to legal reserves the remainder of the increase was driven by bbvas onemonth operating expenses of million as well as increased business activity and marketing for legacy pnc obviously with the acquisition our operating expenses are going to be higher going forward nevertheless we remain disciplined around our expense management and as weve previously stated we have a goal to reduce pnc standalone expenses by million in through our continuous improvement program and were on track to achieve our full year target additionally were confident well realize the full million in net expense savings of bbva usas expense base in our credit metrics are presented on slide and reflect the impact of the acquisition apart from the addition of the acquired loans credit performance improved considerably within the legacy pnc portfolio nonperforming the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 loans were billion at june and million were related to the acquired loans pncs legacy nonperforming loans declined million due to decreases in both commercial and consumer total delinquencies were billion at june of which the acquisition impact was million legacy pncs delinquencies declined million net chargeoffs for legacy pnc were million the lowest level since with an annualized chargeoff to total loans ratio of basis points acquired loan net chargeoffs were million which was largely the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition slide shows the change in our allowance for credit losses during the second quarter within our legacy portfolio we released reserves by approximately million related to both improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors upon closing the acquisition we established a billion acl for the acquired loans or through fair value loan marks of billion related to purchase credit deteriorated loans and an initial provision of billion related to nonpcd loans the initial bbva usa acl to total loans of was subsequently reduced to at the end of the quarter as a result of portfolio changes so in total as a result our total quarter yearend reserves for the combined entity were billion representing of consolidated loans outstanding turning to slide now that weve closed the bbva usa acquisition i wanted to provide an update to some of the deal metrics all of which are the same or have improved since our deal announcement as you know the purchase price was an allcash fixed price and was approximately billion at closing and as ive already mentioned tangible book value per share and the cet1 ratio are favorable relative to our original expectations we continue to project an internal rate of return in excess of earnings per share accretion of more than and an annualized expense reduction of million in additionally our expectation for nonrecurring merger and integration costs is approximately million the majority of which we expect to be recognized in consistent with our initial expectations taking a look at the credit metrics these have all improved since weve announced the deal and as a result the acl to total loans for bbva usa is better than our original expectations in addition and as anticipated our net purchase accounting adjustment is nominal with a net fair value premium of million the majority of which will be amortized over the next several years for the second quarter due to the maturity of some shortdated acquired assets we realized a million benefit to net interest income which will not recur in summary pnc reported a strong second quarter highlighted by the successful acquisition of bbva usa we expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders as we begin to realize the potential of the combined franchise in regard to our view of the overall economy our current expectations are for gdp to surpass prerecession levels sometime during the third quarter and for the fed funds rate to remain near zero throughout looking at the third quarter of which will now include a full quarter impact of bbva usas operations compared to the second quarter of we expect total spot loan balances to be up modestly which includes a billion decline in ppp loans on a percentage basis we expect nii to be up in the midteens we expect fee income to be up in the midsingle digits we expect total noninterest expense excluding integration expenses to be up in the high singledigits we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities gains and visa activities and we expect third quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 for annual guidance taking into account our first half operating results and the addition of six more months of bbva usa forecasted operating results plus our expectation for modest loan growth in the second half of the year we expect revenues to be up between to and expenses excluding integration costs to be up between and for the full year compared with pnc standalone we acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year but that remains to be seen and as a result is not included in our guidance and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so its great to see the loan growth start to pick up here the first question i have is just on how we should think about the loan growth in your book now that bbva has come in is there going to be a churn period here where youve got some loans in that book that youre likely to be exiting and then growing through that churn or would you suggest that thats not really big enough to matter when were thinking about the loan growth william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at the margin its going to matter but its extended over a bunch of years were not going to sell portfolios or robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc rapid exit william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc rapid exit so through time we will mature things and those balances will likely run off from certain industries as we grow balances from other target industries but that stretch is over two three four years betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 okay great all right and then separately your harris williams business obviously is already national but does the bbva footprint that youve added now do anything for them in their business with middle market william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at the margin right it just adds a larger network of potential clients and conversations so yes now they obviously are in all of these markets to some extent already but now we have more clients and will therefore have more dialogue so i would expect ph a while betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ph but that is not for sure so well be able to introduce our new commercial clients through bbva usa to harris williams if they havent already been introduced william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right yeah now that was really strong result from them this quarter and then just lastly the dividend hike that you recently announced how do you think about that from the perspective of payout ratio and im just wondering should we expect that your full run rate of the bbva usa expenses coming out is already in your earnings outlook when you were thinking about setting that dividend up william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im trying to think of a simple way to answer this so long story short theres room on the dividend on our forward income we were in a bit of a fire drill because we managed to close the deal a month sooner than we thought which meant that we kind of had ccar results in the deal closed which then threw us into the fire drill to figure out what we could do im not going to say in a hurry but on short notice which is what we did and robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc an acceleration william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc an acceleration of kind of what we had thought so there is room on that certainly as we go forward and we just thought it was important to get something done and not miss this cycle which is what we acted on the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats perfect that makes ph sense robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph and often weve said weve im sorry weve said for years that we expect with this model and this business mix that a to payout ratio on the dividend is our target range betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great all right yeah now that was my gut feel that there was room there so appreciate that commentary thanks so much william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you for your question up next we have a question from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc you guys have made impressive progress in your national expansion strategy as you look ahead how integral is the acquisition of additional branches to youre furthering your national expansion on paper its easy to do a traditional analysis where you look at pncs revenues per branch and bbvas revenues per branch to isolate the opportunity to improve productivity and what that would mean in terms of incremental revenues per branch but when you try to sell the idea of acquiring additional branches to generalists theres a natural pushback on why those branch acquisitions are necessary in the first place given what were seeing with the digitization of the business rbc is a great example where we saw your branch count rise sharply in before falling significantly for the better part of the next decade so how important was it to acquire those branches to begin with i know theres a lot there but was hoping you could speak to that point in general william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 i wouldnt focus so much on branches as i would on clients so in the future could you see us do smaller deals in market to gain greater share possibly now the values today just seem way too high to me but possibly but the purpose of that wouldnt be to get branches per se instead it would be to get clients and then we would optimize the branch network as we did with rbc after the fact robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and some natural conversion to solution centers from traditional branches which we as to your point bill weve been doing william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right understood separately with the curve having flattened a bit since your comments last quarter has there been any change to your thought process around deploying a larger percentage of your liquidity into securities and within that how worried are you about giving up some of your future asset sensitivity in exchange for the nearterm nii benefit were hearing different philosophies from different banks but would just love to get your thoughts william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i guess first off as you saw we went at it pretty aggressively before we saw the big rally here we still have a lot of liquidity we barely put a dent in our liquidity even after writing the check for bbva so were still very asset sensitive having said that the recent rallys going to cause us to slow down and be more tactical than we had been during the last quarter and well watch how this plays out i personally believe that the current rally is way overdone and i dont fully understand it and were likely to or not likely we will slow down relative to what we saw in the last quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and our expectations of that are built into our guidance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and if i could squeeze in one last one i wanted to ask if you could look ahead a bit longer term at the opportunity to drive efficiency improvements if the forward curve is right and we get one hike around the end of and another in the middle of and assume no further steepening there are a lot of moving parts there but could you just speak to your confidence level in being able to drive your efficiency ratio into that sort of high range the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the math takes you there the question is simply a function of when we look out to a function of the ph tail end integration costs is to whether you see it what period of time you actually see it but the math takes you there once we get the costs out of the bbva franchise and what we would expect that revenue environment to look like bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you for taking my questions william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you and up next we have a question from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead sir mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so i guess i have a shortterm question and a longterm question the longterm question is what inning are you in in your tech transformation youve spent seven years getting your common infrastructure together and that prepares you well for the bbva integration so thats kind of the good news and what inning are you in but then i think the bad news is youre guiding this year for slightly negative operating leverage the last slide and i know you dont like having that and why is that worse than expected when you should be having some synergies from bbva thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc let me do the shortterm one no im glad you asked that question mike because at first read you might conclude that but thats not what were saying what were saying in the guidance for full year with revenue percentages going up less than expense percentages thats simply the overlay of the bbva usa acquisition six the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 months into our results they have a higher efficiency ratio so thats if you think about it thats largely the opportunity there pnc standalone we said at the beginning of the year it was going to be stable we were going to fight for positive operating leverage halfway through revenues up low singledigits expenses are up low singledigits so were still fighting and as i mentioned in my comments prior to the qa were going to keep fighting and bill i dont know if you want to do longterm william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc do you follow that mike i mean its simple we layered on a less efficient organization on top of us and its causing the math to be what it is robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the legacy pnc business is kind of on target for what we said and then the opportunity set is to drive the new organization down to our level robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc pnc level william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc of efficiency yeah or better mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then the longer term question william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the issue on technology i mean think about look were of the way along where we would like to be in terms of what i would just call a modern platform across everything from data centers to the way we develop to the way we do automated testing and deploy and so on and so forth so were pretty far along i think what happens down the road with technology is much more about clientfacing technology and the ability to compete effectively in the new ecosystem of fintechs and where payments are going and all of that stuff and were prepared for that were going to invest hard into that we have the core technology behind us to allow us to play in that space but thats where the fight is going to be and i think that game is just getting started the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well look indiscernible start to extend the metaphor the games going into extra innings technologys going to be around for a while william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and where do you think i mean youre i appreciate a number like and building a modern platform and again after seven or eight years of doing that where do you think the average bank is in that transformation because youve been talking about this more than others william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah look i dont have an informed view its hard to figure out what other people are actually doing if i just think about our ideal state compared to where we are pncs ideal state might be different than what somebody else aspires to i still see us with certain applications that need to be reengineered to kind of be plugandplay through api other people may or may not care about that so were playing our own game our goal obviously is to be able to use technology as an advantage not just in terms of cost but also in terms of speed to market and creativity as to what we can offer to clients robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and were well on our way william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc right okay thanks a lot operator thank you for your question and now we have a question from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead sir the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc want to see if you can give a little more color on loan demand particularly on the commercial side are you starting to see any signs of capex activity beginning to influence line drawdowns and if you are where and what areas are you seeing some strength and what borrower segments thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey john its rob and id give you a little bit of color there generally speaking utilization rates were up a little bit quarteroverquarter though not much where we are seeing continued growth that we started to see as green shoots in the first quarter is in our business credit to asset base book real growth there that is encouraging because that tends to be a leading indicator of loan demand so thats largely where weve seen the growth but on the margin we would expect to see in terms of getting to where strong loan growth would be coming more utilization across the general middle market book which is yet to show up william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean the good news inside all that is were actually winning a lot of clients and were extending facilities at a pace beyond where weve been for a bunch of years the problem is theyre just not drawing under this robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc credit facilities thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah so were in a good place for when loan demand comes back and we continue to grow client share and we see that by the way in the fee growth that were getting through tm and others indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc activitys picked up the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks thats helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so weve definitely advanced in the first quarter william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc right got it okay and then on the ma front i know youre still digesting the bbva deal and everything but as you look at other markets are there any other markets geographically that you think a deal would make sense to give you a more critical mass just like you looked at the southeast that way i just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your footprint how you think about that and then separately bill im curious what your take is on president bidens executive order particularly implying more scrutiny around bank mergers does that change how you think about deals thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well yes to the second on the first issue you should just assume that we look at all the same stuff that you do im not going to give you an area of the country we looked and youve seen us through time made decisions based on value creation for shareholders so that may or may not mean additional geographies it may or may not mean filling in an existing geography it will very likely mean well continue to do small addon acquisitions that give us product capability for clients the executive order on looking at competition amongst banks i mean its a practical matter that would actually have to change for the bank approval process to change would be more about the feds rules on approving mergers than i think it would be coming out of president bidens order im not expert on it but i think it is safe to say that a larger deal in todays environment would get much more political scrutiny and noise than we did with the bbva deal that weighs on us john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks that helps the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 operator thank you for your question we now have a question from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead sir r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co maybe rob i can sort of back into things based on the guidance but just would be curious to hear your thoughts on how the net interest margin rate moves from here just lots of moving parts between shifting some of the cash into securities layering in a full quarter of bbva and then weve got the fair value premium amortization as well so any thoughts there would be appreciated robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah now thats a lot there scott back in the first quarter we had said we called a trough in nim were still holding that i do think nim will drift higher not necessarily by a lot but i think weve seen the bottom r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then just on the reserves i think sort of pre adjustments that were made for covid but postcecl adoption i think you guys were around 145ish reserve is that a good number to assume youll gear down toward even with bbva now in the mix robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well our day one was not that was pnc standalone r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay sorry robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and then if you do some of the math you blend in bbvas day one were going to be a little bit higher on that on average so as weve said the answer to that question all along has been if you consider those times normal back to normal would be somewhere in that neighborhood r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect all right robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good well i appreciate the thought operator thank you operator instructions we now have a question from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead sir gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you share with us when you think back to the national city deal and the rbc deals that you guys did over years ago and granted theyre different than the bbva deal but obviously that experience has given you confidence on this deal can you share with us when do you think the bbva gets fully integrated based upon the experiences that you guys have with those prior two deals is it three years out four years out how long does it really become seamless where you cant tell everythings running very smoothly william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres a lot embedded in that question i mean the basic service structure so what happens in a branch the applications the product delivery all of that stuff basically will be done by the end of this year right so the real the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 question then becomes how do we get the client penetration and growth rates in the newer markets the fee penetration to grow to legacy pnc markets and what we found in rbc is in some of those newer markets that took somewhere around three years i guess rob we expect it will be faster today first because bbva actually had a reasonable book of business that we could cross sell into immediately and secondly we just kind of have a better playbook weve been at it for a while so we have the teams built today theyre calling today and i generally would expect wed robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think itd be a little faster and i think the receptivity to the pnc brand is probably a little more than it was ph three years ago so that helps too gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i apologize if you addressed this early in your comments but bill and rob do you guys have any timing on the share repurchase program i think you said its going to be over four quarters but i know theres no restrictions now like the old ccar test that you guys had limits on how much you could buy have you given any thought on how you want to calibrate the repurchases robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well were going to do it opportunistically gerard so we will do it ideally well put together like we always have some autopilot program and then on top of that some discretionary piece and the discretionary piece will be the variable obviously thats what weve done in the past thats what well continue to do so theres some more flexibility there obviously and well take advantage of that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good morning just two questions here i wonder if you could discuss the strength in consumer services fees last quarter was up what million just on a standalone basis and i know in the release it said increased business activity was wondering if you could provide any more color there robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 yeah hi terry this is rob yeah we did we saw a lot of activity there and most of that is just more consumer activity as youd expect as the economy comes back on track inside of that where we saw particular strength was debit card spend debit card spend is a big component of it and the acceleration there was really strong terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just as a robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats maybe more color than you want but what showed up this quarter as i said in debit card spends what our team was telling us was a lot of micro purchases that had gone away so cups of coffee and morning purchases on the way to work are now part of the volume again terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect and then as a followup just the corporate service fees maybe if you could talk about the pipelines there and is the quarterly runrate now is that a 600plus million in revenue quarterly run rate today robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well i would say just in terms of the color so you got to take a look at it now obviously within combined form and put in a full three months of bbva but corporate fees also as we said earlier are showing increased activity we were a little elevated in the second quarter because of harris williams which did twice the volume of the first quarter so you got to take that into account but your maths in the right run rate place terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you and we now have a followup question from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for the followup i just had a quick one on the money transfer business and the opportunity that you see there some investors have expressed concerns over disintermediation risk in that business as the cost of transferring money continues to fall and competitors in the space leverage technology to help consumers transfer money more cheaply the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 is disintermediation risk in legacy bbvas money transfer business a concern for you guys and if you could discuss how youre thinking about the growth outlook for that business and opportunities that you guys may have to maybe leverage technology and just speak to that opportunity in general that would be helpful william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well i think the whole product including the business transfer service is a disintermediated product i mean it was what we have is the same thing that other people are building and frankly doing in more scale the key to success on it is to make sure that you have distribution receiving and networks which we do have through latin america and europe and that you have compliance to be able to build it so its a competitive space im glad we have the product i think the actual product is going to be table stakes for banks our ability to grow it and scale it were going through different use cases that bring on potential corporate disbursements and other things that we hadnt thought of before but i think it becomes a table stakes products that started through disintermediation kind of to your original question right this was built outside of the banking system bbva just happened to have built one that were now integrating into our core platform so were pretty excited by it and i think time will tell how that product evolves and who uses it bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph and in terms of the the financial impact isnt large william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so its more the upside than anything bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you operator thank you there are no further questions
