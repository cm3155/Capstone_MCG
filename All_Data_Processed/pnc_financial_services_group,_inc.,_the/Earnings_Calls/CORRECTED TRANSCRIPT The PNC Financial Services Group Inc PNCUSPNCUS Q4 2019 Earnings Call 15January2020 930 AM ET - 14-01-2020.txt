sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis total loans grew billion to billion linked quarter compared to the fourth quarter of growth was billion or investment securities of billion decreased billion or linked quarter due to portfolio runoff primarily in treasury yearover year total security balances increased billion or our cash balances at the federal reserve averaged billion for the fourth quarter up billion linked quarter and billion yearoveryear primarily as a result of strong deposit growth deposits grew billion or the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 linked quarter and billion or yearoveryear as of december our basel iii common equity tier ratio was estimated to be compared to at september for the full year we returned billion of capital to shareholders this represented a increase over and was comprised of billion in common dividend and billion in share repurchases of note the tailoring rules became effective january and as a result will provide us increased flexibility in managing both our capital and liquidity levels going forward as we announced earlier this morning weve received approval from the federal reserve to repurchase up to billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of which is in addition to the share repurchase programs of up to billion approved by the fed as part of pncs capital plan this will provide us the ability to repurchase additional shares over the next two quarters the level of which will depend on market conditions our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was our return on average common equity was and our return on tangible common equity was our tangible book value was per common share as of december an increase of compared to a year ago slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail average loan balances of billion in the fourth quarter were up billion compared to the third quarter the growth was driven by consumer lending which increased billion or reflecting higher residential mortgage auto and credit card loan balances commercial lending decreased million linked quarter as growth in our corporate banking business was more than offset by declines in our real estate business primarily due to a billion decrease in our multifamily warehouse balances compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew or billion commercial lending balances increased billion and consumer lending balances increased billion each growing by as the slide show the yield on our loan balances declined in the fourth quarter primarily the result of lower libor rates importantly the rate paid on our deposits also declined basis points linked quarter an acceleration in the pace of the decline from the third quarter of deposits of billion increased in both the yearoveryear and linked quarter comparisons the yearoveryear increase of billion or reflected strong customer growth linked quarter deposits increased billion or due in part to seasonal growth in commercial deposits notably noninterestbearing deposits grew billion or in the fourth quarter both comparisons benefited by a billion increase related to the new sweep deposit product program we began offering our asset management clients in september as you can see on slide full year revenue was a record billion up million or approximately driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income expenses increased million or and remained well controlled importantly we generated positive operating leverage of in our full year provision was million an increase of million compared to which was driven by strong loan growth and continued credit normalization in our loan portfolio our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was down from the third quarter as a result of lower state income taxes and tax credit benefits for the full year our effective tax rate was and reflected the lower fourth quarter tax rate the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide you can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years driven by our diverse business mix full year net interest income was approximately billion a record for pnc and an increase of million or compared with as higher loan balances and yields were partially offset by higher funding costs our net interest margin decreased in to down basis points compared to driven by the declining rate environment throughout the year for the fourth quarter net interest income of billion was down million or from the third quarter lower loan and securities yields were substantially offset by lower funding costs net interest margin decreased basis points to in the fourth quarter mostly due to the effect of lower interest rates primarily libor although lower rates reduced our borrowing costs that benefit was more than offset by the downward impact of libor in our commercial loan yields fullyear noninterest income was up million or and increased million or in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter importantly we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across our franchise and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of billion in during fee income increased million or reflecting strong customer growth in our legacy and new markets growth was across all categories except service charges on deposits the million or decline in service charges on deposits was reflective of our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers fourth quarter fee income of billion increased million or compared to the third quarter taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories asset management fees increased million driven by higher earnings from pncs investment in blackrock consumer service fees declined million or reflecting seasonally higher credit card activity that was more than offset by a fullyear trueup of credit card rewards corporate service fees grew million or across various categories and included growth in our treasury management product revenue residential mortgage noninterest income decreased by million driven by a lower benefit from rmsr hedge gains as well as lower loan sales revenue service charges on deposits increased million or reflecting seasonally higher customer activity the final component of our revenue other noninterest income increased million compared with the third quarter the growth was primarily driven by higher revenue from private equity investments and a gain of million related to the sale of our proprietary mutual funds partially offsetting this was a negative visa derivative valuation adjustment of million turning to slide our fullyear expenses were billion an increase of million or compared with as we continue to invest in our strategies technology and employees taking a look at the fourth quarter expenses grew by million or linked quarter personnel increased million due to higher benefits including a special yearend grant to more than of our employees mainly in the form of health savings account contributions totaling million personnel also reflected higher incentive compensation associated with business activity in the fourth quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 equipment expense increased million largely due to million of technologyrelated writeoffs these write offs primarily resulted from the benefit of the tailoring rule which now allows us to decommission compliance and regulatory systems that are no longer required our efficiency ratio for the full year was improving from last year as you know expense management continues to be a focus for us we had a goal of million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal looking forward to our annual cip will once again be million which we expect to contribute to the funding of our business and technology investments our credit quality metrics are presented on slide and remained historically strong fullyear provision for loan losses totaled million and net chargeoffs were million in reflecting our strong loan growth and some credit normalization in our portfolio on a linkedquarter basis provision increased million in the fourth quarter due to both consumer lending and reserves attributable to certain commercial credits net chargeoffs increased million to million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter commercial chargeoffs accounted for million of the increase driven primarily by a few specific credits and consumer chargeoffs grew million mostly related to our credit card and auto portfolios reserves to total loans remained stable year over year at compared to at yearend annualized net chargeoffs to total loans was basis points in the fourth quarter and while up this is still well below our throughthecycle average notably the leading indicators for credit quality continued to perform well nonperforming loans were down million or compared to yearend and yearoveryear total delinquencies were up million or as you know we adopted cecl the new accounting standard for credit losses effective january based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of december the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately million or to our allowance for credit losses at december the increase is driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longerduration assets require more reserves under the cecl methodology our consumer reserve will increase approximately million or and our commercial reserve will decrease approximately million or these metrics include reserves for unfunded commitments we plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10k disclosure as we move forward under cecl it is a new accounting standard with many variables and as a result we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning our allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models and estimation techniques utilizing for example historical losses borrower characteristics economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts as well as other relevant factors for expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years well use four macroeconomic scenarios and their estimated probabilities given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under cecl during well shift from our current practice of providing a quarterly provision guidance range to providing forecasted chargeoffs levels however in order to establish a context for the level of change in provision expense under cecl for this upcoming quarter well provide a range for expected provision expense based simply on expected chargeoffs level plus cecl reserve rates for net new loans this guidance will assume our economic scenarios and weights remain constant the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 and should any of these variables change either favorably or unfavorably our actual provision expense may also vary possibly materially in summary pnc reported a successful and were well positioned for throughout we expect continued steady growth in gdp and we expect interest rates to remain relatively stable taking these assumptions into consideration our fullyear guidance compared to full year results is as follows we expect loan growth to be in the range of to we expect total revenue growth to be in the low end of the low singledigit range which includes approximately of net interest income growth we expect expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately based on this guidance we believe well generate positive operating leverage of approximately in looking at first quarter compared to fourth quarter results we expect average loans to be up approximately we expect total net interest income to decline approximately reflecting one less day in the quarter we expect fee income to be down approximately we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect expenses to be down in the midsingledigit range and we expect provision to be between million and million with that bill and i are ready to take your questions bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc dina can we have the first question question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the provision guidance the million to million for the quarter can you give us a little bit more color i know going forward youre going to guide more on chargeoffs the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc as you said but regarding the quarter can you give us a little bit more color behind that million to million how much of that is the cecl day two component and then how much of that is reflecting underlying credit trends thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure john so for the first quarter guidance i kept it simple and were just going to take forecasted chargeoffs which we expect to be at the same level that we experienced in the fourth quarter of and then add to that the cecl loan loss rates of the fourth quarter of to our projected loan growth and thats the simple math john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay okay and that is carrying forward like you said or assuming that fourth quarter chargeoffs level of basis points which was up a fair amount from last quarter and from the year ago so thats the normalization youre talking about robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc can you give us a little bit more detail around that normalization i know you mentioned card and auto but also youve had several commercial credits come up over the past several quarters that have been impacting is there a trend that youre seeing on the commercial side as well thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john its bill we talk about normalization and we have for years where our chargeoff rate is below what we would expect to see through the cycle but i would tell you our nearterm pressure on chargeoffs is more related to card and auto than anything else and its not really related to changing in the economy we dipped our toe into some the lower end of our credit bucket probably a year ago and those vintages are starting to play through weve subsequently shut that down six months ago so its going to work its way through the snake here but i dont actually see personally that chargeoffs are so much normalizing because of the economy per se as we have some elevated consumer stuff that will reverse through time the other thing that we had a big debate internally just on what to guide as it related to provision going forward because cecl and the impact to cecl has so many variables on what provision will be we can reasonably the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 forecast chargeoffs but of course outlook on economy mix of loan growth pace of loan growth and many other factors ultimately impact how that provisions going to behave beyond chargeoffs so were giving it our best shot it could be high or low robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right well its new cecl is new and its been a lot of work as you know both in terms of what weve done as we ran through parallel in to establish our transition amount but going forward we feel good about our framework weve got a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast weve got the four macroeconomic scenarios that well detail in our disclosures but to bills point and what i said in my opening comments theres just a lot of factors and then on top of that its new william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so theres just going to be some learning curve aspects to sort of the practical application of cecl real time william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and on the ci side john we really havent seen anything that youll see some specific credits were adding to by the way weve been doing this for five years whats changed is the recoveries that weve gotten through time robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc way back from the crisis are gone so its not so much that our new stuff is elevated in any given point as our recoveries have dropped john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thats helpful and if i could just ask one more on the margin side i know you gave the spread income guidance for the linked quarter and for the full year expectation but how do you think the margin will traject from here should we see some stabilization now that we have the pause thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah i think so i think so john we expect rates to be stable we dont have nim guidance officially thats more of an outcome but i think well spend most of the if everything stays constant well spend the next the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 year pretty much in this range we could actually go up in a particular quarter as deposit costs are continuing to come down but not a lot in either direction william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc one of the things that hit us this quarter was just elevated amortization expense on our premium mortgage securities which we think has probably hit its peak robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but i think well be in this range william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc up or down john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thanks rob thanks bill robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure yeah sure operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi erika william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 i just wanted to ask a little bit more detail rob about on the previous question so how should we think about one the opportunity to deploy what seems like an extra billion to billion of cash what opportunities you see for that cash going forward and also deposit costs trending down sort of balancing what has been a really successful initiative to go beyond your legacy footprint with reflecting lower rates robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc okay well through the first part about that in terms of the new lcr requirements we have and we will continue to work down our cash balances to the new requirement of the first step is we talked about this on the third quarter call is to pay down some shortterm debt and then take a look going forward in terms of where we would deploy that unfortunately securities yields arent terrific so i dont think were going to move quickly in that direction but william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the simplest thing to do is to let some of our wholesale borrowings run off robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is what william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and thats what weve been doing robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is what were doing and well continue to do thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and on the deposits william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i was just going to say on the deposit side we have been reasonably aggressive in dropping rates and has still been able to grow balances both interestbearing and noninterestbearing so were going to continue to pursue that one of the things thats happening in the background here of course is the fed over the last two or three months has been injecting cash back into the system through their repo activities which means the fight for deposits that the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 was pretty intense is letting up somewhat as cash comes back into the system and im not exactly sure how thats going to play out erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just taking a step back is there a difference in terms of stickiness in terms of the deposits that you raise through lets say a highyield savings account versus a checking account that you are offering a cash incentive to open william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so the national deposits have been much more sticky than we expected because at least as an individual erika i kind of assume that unless you converted it to a fulltime account which weve had some success at doing i assume people would shop those rates and move we actually havent seen that be the case even though we have dropped really pretty far below the competitive band on what were offering now im sure theres elasticity to that but thus far we havent seen much movement the upfront money on checking accounts which all of us do where you open the account and you swipe your debit card five times and so forth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc a couple of hundred bucks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres a lot of mischief in that so weve had the percentage of people who basically are taking the cash going through the motions and never using the account have made that option less attractive to us than some other things were doing erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc oh thats interesting okay thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but i would say i would just add to that the deposits as we worked rates down across the board deposits have been stickier than what we would have expected william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thank you the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and you see it in the numbers robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i just wanted to ask on the billion supplemental authorization i was definitely glad to see that but just in terms of how you came up with the billion i imagine it ended up given the timing and the ccar cycle being as much art as science but just given where you sort of fleshed out what does it say about sort of dry powder for the next cycle andor other preferences for capital use at this point william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc rob can jump in here but as i mentioned at the goldman conference the ask that we put in had nothing to do with tailoring so it was basically capital that we had in excess from independent of rule change as to the amount beyond the fact that billion is a nice round number you have to remember that our existing program is a pretty big program robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so adding to our existing program by much more than we asked for just didnt seem to make a lot of sense the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right that sounds robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc that was the art of it rather than the science of it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co fair enough fair enough and then just separately i guess i can sort of back into it but bill i think you had noted back in i think it was december when you sort of switched the nii outlook for given the changing rate profile and had suggested maybe up in i imagine that that still holds true but any update on your thinking there and then just overall balance which becomes more selfexplanatory between nii and fees as the year progresses robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i think it still holds whats helping us there is we are forecasting pretty good loan growth for our pipelines look good so when we do that we see up approximately as achievable r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then maybe the main fee drivers as you see them for the year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i think on the fees were in good shape and our fee businesses are big theyre all growing so i think well see a consistent trajectory that weve seen in just going through the broad categories asset management blackrock the component the blackrock component will still do what they do the pc component will have a little bit of will have samestore sales growth but will have a little bit of a challenge in numbers because we divested those businesses and in fact sold some revenue but corporate services consumer services we see staying on the trajectory that theyve been on residential mortgage could be off a little bit but thats pretty small for us and then service charges on deposit we see as being kind of flat because well see more client activity but as i mentioned in my comments we are working toward eliminating a lot of those nuisances that our customers have experienced and we want to get ahead of that so that will kind of offset one another so fees are good r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good all right well thank you very much i appreciate it the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi guys two followups in terms of consumer lending i know you have a longterm goal to remix towards a little bit higher contribution from consumer lending does the cecl or the experience dipping your toe in auto and card that you mentioned in some of the lower spectrum does either of those change your appetite or the degree to which you might be growing consumer loans william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no i would i mean a couple of comments the issue we had by going a little bit down in our risk bucket by the way thats not a huge amount its kind of flowing through our team is supposed to do that test and learn and see and we learned we didnt like it we move on but were growing independent of that if you just look at the balances that weve grown in card and in auto and in resi and even home equity i guess this quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc first time first time in a while william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah theyre executing really well and that will continue the issue for cecl of course is in todays environment its an easier answer to say yes well keep growing home equity and resi on the balance sheet because the loss rates the loss content is so low even in the cecl reserve the challenge will be in a more pressed economy and environment where chargeoffs and losses are higher will you be booking loans that effectively cause negative income in the year you booked them in thats a discussion well have at that period of time i do think as ive always said that cecl in general will hurt consumer lending particularly when its needed most as people pull back because of the financial pain from the reserves but in todays environment i dont see robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and to your question john we have no change in terms of our strategies for growth because of cecl john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah great and the experience like you had youre just finetuning where youre targeting based on the experience of what you had last year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats right robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then in terms of the cet1 that you ultimately target does tailoring affect how you think about what you should run at over time and have you made any kind of finetuning on that and just kind of remind us that target range rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure so tailoring is obviously going to add some flexibility to our capital ratios in terms of tailoring alone we see our capital raise cet1 ratio going up about bps thats including opting out of aoci which hurts by about basis points and then with cecl cecl will affect cet1 thats another basis points basis points so netnetnet tailoring cecl we see our capital ratio going up about sic basis points thats where we are today so that adds a lot of flexibility basis points im sorry basis points 99ish from to ish so thats a lot of flexibility weve talked about a target in the to range so weve got room john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay great all right thanks very much guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey rob hi bill robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys give us some color i jumped on the call late so i apologize if you touched on this rob you mentioned the outlook for loan growth this year its actually one of the better robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc numbers that weve heard from your peers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us some of your peers have told us that there seemed to be a change in business confidence if you will or sentiment in the fourth quarter with these trade deals looking like theyre coming together can you guys share with us what your customers are telling your commercial customers are telling you about how they feel about business for william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well as it relates to trade i think theres a lot of wait and see as to whats really there and how it impacts people so i dont know that people have really changed theyve been and youve seen it in manufacturing and capex theyve been a bit on the sidelines eventually theyre going to have to spend simply to replace dated stuff but i dont know that weve seen that yet our growth on the ci side continues to come from specialty businesses and our geographic expansion and probably one of the things that makes us a bit of an outlier just in terms of growth is once we turn consumer positive which weve done the totality that the loan book is growing and we just havent had that in the past robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes thats right and its pretty balanced in terms of our outlook and the pipelines look good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good in fact that was going to be my second question bill can you guys kind of share with us how much of the projected growth what you think youll see in is coming from your existing footprint versus whats coming from these new markets that youve penetrated the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ive seen that statistic i dont remember it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the new markets are accretive to our loan growth in terms of percentages but theyre working off pretty small base william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc they are a healthy percentage of our growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc far outpacing the legacy books and they add im not going to guess a percentage but ive seen it they add to the total robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc they do no question william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and i guess lastly on that other than you guys being handsome good guys whats getting how are you guys winning these customers in these new markets is it just better products that you have that your competitors dont have for the customers that youre targeting william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a number of factors that start with really good people it includes bringing to our new markets the totality of pnc with our regional president model with our community involvement and yes its dependent on our products we show up in a market we get embedded in the community and centers of influence we go in with our foundation and grow it great we pick the clients we want to cover and bank longterm and were very patient we will call on them for two and three years before we get a shot on goal the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 and when we get that our products are very good particularly in comparison to some of the smaller inmarket players weve been doing this going all the way back to the rbc acquisition and it works we use the same playbook in each market that we go into we talk about breaking even inside of three years weve been able to do that with all the vintages and well keep going gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard i would just add to that and ive said that before theres just great receptivity of these corporate clients and prospects for the pnc calling effort and once that dialogue goes as bill said then we compete well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the other thing that i would just remind you and this is important the potential criticism that somehow we are out just participating in other loans is not at all accurate when you look at our crosssell rates in those markets theyre pushing fees of total revenue which is not wildly off of what we do in our legacy markets robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and signifies a relationship rather than just purchasing loans william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great very insightful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys just a question on the expense side rob i heard you say that youre kind of reupping the million cip and also robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 kind of continuing to move that overall expense growth down to flattish right which is a nice robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc change over the last couple of years and im just wondering underneath that are some other things also starting to taper down in terms of i wouldnt dare to say that you guys are changing your investment pace but what else is helping underneath the surface kind of clamp down on that overall rate of expense growth that gets you closer to flattish thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well sure i mean it is that no were not backing off of our investments or anything along those lines we just think that the continuous improvement program that we have in place is the strength of the company that we can achieve in essence cost savings to fund these investments on an annual basis and thats something that weve been very good at and that will continue so i dont think theres a whole lot thats changing under that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just one more followup on the kind of balance sheet mix sense so you mentioned that the low rate environment doesnt have a lot of right now interest in robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the securities portfolio right so youre growing loans a lot which and youre able to pay down wholesale debt so does the mix of earning assets continue to push more towards higheryielding loans and you just kind of keep the portfolio in check how do you balance the left side of the balance sheet robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc a little bit but thats a little bit in that direction but its not that dramatic william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean at the end of the day we are underinvested today were certainly going to invest runoff well probably grow one of the things going on in the background here is on the receive fixed swap side because the curve steepened out while we had largely gotten out of or lowered our position were back into that so you cant just look at the securities book in terms of the way were actually investing against the yield curve you can think about it in terms of cash but its not necessarily the sole tool we use to manage the balance sheet the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and that means that youre back into it meaning that youre more protected against lower from here right given no shame getting back into it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay i get it understood thank you operator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hello matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so there was obviously a lot of commentary just on the strong capital and you generate a lot of capital just as we think about like various uses of that capital as far as buybacks dividends maybe you could talk about some of other potential uses bill youve been pretty clear how you feel on bank deals but what about loan portfolios weve seen some branch divestitures from other people doing deals acquiring technology fee deal opportunities just kind of the whole portfolio of options thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a fair question and you should assume that we look at loan portfolios we continue to do so we look at a lot of stuff we look at product addons and youve seen us do that in small size in terms of capabilities in the ci space things we would do in retail and well continue to be rational actors in terms of how we spend the capital we have been pretty clear on our thoughts on depository institutions and that hasnt really changed so well let this play out its nice if you think about the environment that we are going into notwithstanding the strength of the economy the volatility of kind of what comes in an election year i think having a lot of capital and being able the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 to generate a lot of capital is a really good thing simply because of the opportunities that are likely to present themselves here matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just long term youve talked about trying to boost growth on the consumer side and obviously over the years there have been asset generators available or big credit card portfolios and you havent done any of those but if you look out kind of next fiveplus years it does seem like that could be an opportunity for you youve got all these deposits i know youre not a huge fan of holding a ton of securities if there are other options william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc but any change in thinking of that again like looking out longterm maybe now is not the right time in the cycle but that is how one big difference between your balance sheet and say usbs and others william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look you never say never but my experience is the consumer asset generators that come up for sale are broken number one and number two we arent the house to fix them we are a prime lender in consumer thats focused on customer experience we arent a subprime lender which typically most of these people play in we dont understand it we dont want to be that person the fact that if theyre for sale they blew up they didnt understand it either suggests to me that all else equal you wont see us you wont ever see us do that now you never say never but that is my likely guess matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc we said that for some time thats not a new view william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the flip side of that by the way on the ci side were really good at fixing busted ci so big portfolios that are troubled or lenders that are troubled show up with big portfolios that is something we pursue thats in our wheelhouse matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator and your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys good morning a question on provisioning and cecl so i think your reserve ratio is about i think ended the quarter at about or i think and with cecl on january that gets trued up well it will show up in the first quarter results but it will get trued up based on the fourth quarter to as i think about provisioning going forward and some of the dynamics around that reserve ratio how do i think about growth in the marginal growth of your portfolio versus that are you growing in loans that on average have materially higher loss content than and how do we think about that mix change in terms of how to think about provisioning versus chargeoffs in alll ratio evolution william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc youll drive yourself insane i can tell you think through saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all else equal william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right yeah the issue is if we grow in the same categories today you wouldnt necessarily have the same loss content because for example we shut off the lower fico scored consumer saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc if we shift to secured products in ci versus unsecured products it shifts if we do more card than we do resi mortgage this thing is going to be really hard to predict and what we have to do and we will do is give you in effect a provision attribution each quarter so that you understand robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc its part of the disclosure yeah which is part of the disclosure thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right and look the lost content robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the thing to remember is we have more reserves right here at day one william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so the is going to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah so we got a lot of reserves saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it no fair but like to the extent mix is changing and theres no change in your strategy and the trajectory which has seen auto cards grow disproportionately albeit from a lower base i would think that if that trend continues your loss content and your expected losses over time assuming all else equal which i know is unrealistic i mean shouldnt we assume that your alll ratio given current trends should move higher from here william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the challenge with that is the assumption that the absolute growth in consumer will somehow keep pace with the absolute growth in ci which it wont simply because ci is disproportionately larger so yes consumer will grow but youve got to remember that thats balanced by larger ci book growing just as fast robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right thats right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right so the balance growth is much bigger just from okay got it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc that makes sense okay all right thats very helpful thanks the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thank you operator there are no further questions william stanton demchak chairman president chief
