expected record nii in our fee income grew with a very strong quarter in capital markets and we remain disciplined on the expense front second we continue to see strong growth in activity across our franchise cib continues to have great momentum as new loan production and commitments increased this quarter while overall loan utilization has remained soft the recent fed actions to lower interest

the same period a year ago we remain wellcapitalized and our estimated cet1 ratio increased to as of september regarding the basel iii endgame while certain aspects of the proposed rules are likely to change we estimate our revised standardized ratio which includes aoci to be at quarter end we continue to be wellpositioned with capital flexibility and we returned roughly million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through common dividends and share repurchases slide shows our loans in more detail average loan balances of billion were flat compared to the second quarter as well as the same period a year ago and the yield on total loans increased basis points to in the third quarter commercial loans were stable at billion linked quarter as utilization rates remained low and well below the historical average of roughly we continue to have confidence that commercial loan demand will return in the coming quarters as our loan commitments continue to increase and we expect business investment to return to historical levels consumer loans averaged billion and were stable with the second quarter as growth in auto loans was mostly offset by a decline in residential real estate balances slide details our investment security and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion increased billion or the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to driven by higher rates the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 on new purchases and the full quarter impact of the securities repositioning as of september our securities portfolio duration was approximately years our active receive fixed rate swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled billion on september and the weighted average rate increased basis points to our forward starting swaps were billion with a weighted average receive rate of importantly with our forward starting swaps weve locked in the replacement yield on the majority of our swap maturities at levels higher than existing swaps in current market rates turning to slide we expect considerable run off of lower yielding securities and swaps which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher yielding assets over the next couple of years accumulated other comprehensive income improved by approximately billion or to negative billion on september compared to negative billion on june the linked quarter improvement in aoci was primarily due to lower rates which benefited our swap and available for sale portfolio valuations going forward aoci related to these securities and swaps as well as our held to maturity portfolio will accrete back as they mature and prepay resulting in further growth to tangible book value slide covers our deposit balances in more detail average deposits increased billion or reflecting an increase in interestbearing commercial balances as well as higher time deposits regarding mix noninterest bearing deposits were stable at billion and remained at of total average deposits our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased basis points during the third quarter to reflecting growth in commercial interestbearing deposits we believe our total rate paid on deposits has reached its peak level and with the basis point cut in september weve already begun to reduce deposit pricing looking forward we expect the federal reserve to cut the benchmark rate by basis points at both the november and december meetings which will accelerate deposit repricing particularly within our high beta commercial interestbearing deposits turning to slide we highlight our income statement trends third quarter net income was billion or per share comparing the third quarter to the second quarter total revenue of billion increased million net interest income grew by million or and our net interest margin was an increase of basis points fee income increased million or other noninterest income was million and included negative million of visarelated activity noninterest expense at billion decreased million or as a result ppnr grew linked quarter and we generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter provision was million reflecting portfolio activity and our effective tax rate was turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends third quarter revenue increased million driven by higher fee and net interest income partially offset by lower other noninterest income other noninterest income included negative million of visa related activity net interest income of billion increased million or driven by higher yields on interest earning assets fee income was billion and increased million or linked quarter looking at the detail asset management and brokerage income grew million or reflecting favorable equity and fixed income market performance capital markets and advisory fees increased approximately million or driven by higher ma advisory activity as well as broad growth across most categories the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 card and cash management decreased million or as higher treasury management revenue was more than offset by credit card origination incentives lending and deposit revenue grew million or due to increased customer activity mortgage revenue was up million linked quarter driven by a million increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights other noninterest income of million included visa derivative fair value adjustments of negative million primarily related to visas september announcement of a billion litigation escrow funding notably we continue to see strong momentum across our lines of business and throughout our markets and yeartodate noninterest income of billion grew approximately million or compared to the same period last year turning to slide our noninterest expense of billion declined million or excluding the second quarter million contribution expense to the pnc foundation noninterest expense increased million or linked quarter personnel expense increased million or reflecting higher incentive compensation related to increased business activity importantly all other categories declined or remained stable yeartodate noninterest expenses increased by million or excluding the million fdic special assessment and million foundation contribution expense in noninterest expense is down compared to the same period a year ago we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts we increased our cip goal last quarter from million to million and were on track to achieve that goal in as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by an increase in cre office loans total delinquencies of billion were stable with june net loan chargeoffs were million the million linked quarter increase was driven primarily by lower commercial recoveries and our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on september stable at june slide provides more detail on our cre office credit metrics we continue to see stress in the office portfolio given the challenges inherent in this book and a lack of demand for office properties cre office criticized loans were essentially stable linked quarter but npls increased due to the migration of criticized loans to nonperforming status net loan chargeoffs within the cre office portfolio were down slightly however going forward we expect additional chargeoffs on this book the sides of which will vary quartertoquarter given the nature of the loans as of september our reserves on the overall office portfolio were and inside of that on the multi tenant portfolio both up slightly from prior quarter the modest increase in reserves reflects the continued valuation adjustments across the portfolio and specific reserves for certain credits furthermore cre office balances declined were approximately million linked quarter as we continue to manage our exposure down accordingly we believe were adequately reserved in summary pnc reported a solid third quarter regarding our view of the overall economy were expecting continued economic growth in the fourth quarter resulting in real gdp growth of approximately in and unemployment remains slightly above through year end we expect the fed to cut rates two additional times in with a basis point decrease in november and another in december the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 looking at the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of we expect average loans to be stable net interest income to be up approximately fee income to be down to due to the elevated third quarter capital markets and msr levels other noninterest income to be in the range of million and million excluding visa activity taking the component pieces of revenue together we expect total revenue to be stable we expect total non interest expense to be up to and we expect fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be approximately million importantly considering our yeartodate results and fourth quarter expectations were on track to generate full year positive operating leverage and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first questions comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc rob if you could just unpack a little bit of the commentary you made on the swaps so i guess first part of this question is i noticed that the receive fixed rate on our asset on your active swaps went up quite a bit quarterto quarter implying that whats rolling off is well sub1 you went from to so im wondering if you could confirm that and looking forward i think you said something in your prepared remarks about replacing expiring swaps at a higher receive fixed rate than you thought so maybe just clarify that statement as well robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well sure good morning erika so yeah youre right and again all of this in terms of your question it points to what is occurring which is that our repricing of our fixed rate assets including our securities loans and swaps is occurring at higher rates so thats all of what weve been talking about for a while true in terms of the swaps new swaps are at a higher rate than the old swaps and then as you recall back in the spring we did execute some forward swaps that lock in rates for maturing assets in that contribute to our statement which we might as well confirm upfront our nii being at record levels in were sticking to it erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 got it okay and just the second part of my question thats the mechanical side now on the strategic side bill its been such a long time since the market has seen a neutral rate of not zero everybody has talked about deposit betas but as we think about what the natural deposit cost is for pnc how should we think about what the spread is lets say we settle at in terms of fed funds whats the spread in terms of fed funds versus your funding costs naturally and additionally just a quick followup to rob as were on the liability side of the balance sheet what drove the strength in deposits and was that mostly corporate and is that permanent balances or is that sort of some corporate balances just parked for now given the uncertainty in the market william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i cant give a specific answer to where we might end up if front rates kind of hold it and change which i expect they will practically you can do most of that yourself right so the zero cost deposits are obviously worth a lot more if theres any steepness to the curve we get that benefit with our fixed rate assets so maybe inside of your question is all else equal if we end up in an environment where front rates are and change and back rates are somewhat higher than that thats the really attractive environment for banks ourselves included robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and then the second part of that erika was that the outperformance in our deposit balances came on the commercial interestbearing side as commercial clients continue to build cash on their balance sheet our expectation is that will hold for the most part through the end of the year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your questions john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the loans side balances are clearly still pressured and you ph fly to find utilizations down a bit to and below your historical could you maybe talk about the underlying demand trends that you are seeing and what do you think is going to be the biggest catalyst to get borrowers off the sidelines and borrowing is it continued rate cuts confidence in that front is it the election if you could just maybe give us some thoughts there and what do you think a growth rate is reasonable as you enter thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john its rob so yeah all year weve yet to deliver the loan growth that we thought was coming at some future point and for all the obvious reasons that youve seen utilization is low and there is a bit of a pause feeling obviously with the election coming up and the rate environment what we point to in terms of on the constructive front is we do continue to add customers we do continue to add loan commitments quarteroverquarter so our commercial clients are putting those lines in place with the anticipation of borrowing so thats a constructive sign and then youve seen the low inventory levels the low capex to sales levels so it does feel as though were at the point of the cycle to where loan growth is not too far off john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks rob for that and then separately capital markets clearly has been a point of strength can you maybe just provide us a little bit of color on the pipeline there and do you expect a pullback in the fourth quarter off these high levels just how should we think about that thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah we do ill expand that a little bit in terms of our fee guidance for the fourth quarter so were pointing to down to and all of that decline is being driven by the elevated msr levels and the elevated capital markets levels that we achieved in the third quarter so for the fourth quarter the msr is pretty straightforward we dont expect to have those levels in the fourth quarter and then on the capital markets side the short answer is we probably pulled a little bit of the fourth quarter activity into the third quarter a lot of that is that our harris williams ma advisory businesses that had a really strong third quarter as well as some of the other broader capital markets story so its a little bit lumpy the pipelines though are strong the momentum is strong capital markets yearoveryear is up north of the back half of including our capital markets guidance for the fourth quarter is up over the first half so the momentums there its just not necessarily going to fall linearly quartertoquarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks rob the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question guess i wanted to followup just a little bit on sort of the lending and deposit discussion i guess first just kind of qualitatively do you have a sense for what a lending recovery might look like when it does come back and i guess the context in that is i recall a time when the bank loans used to grow at some multiple of gdp but its been quite a while since weve seen that so maybe just some toplevel thoughts there and then on the other side of the balance sheet just maybe your sense for how deposit costs behave if lending does come back better you all and i think a lot of the industry are great from a liquidity perspective so curious how much competition factors into your thinking as well william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we can come up with different theories on why loan growth hasnt been there and what it might come back but all of them are me making up theories its been below trend on utilization theres a bunch of uncertainty not the least of which is the election and rates and all the other things that may impact it but its one of the reasons why we kind of said look well produce growth for our shareholders without having to rely on some madeup story as to why there might be loan growth if there is its terrific and at some point itll come back but ive given up trying to forecast it personally on the funding side we are very liquid so we have an opportunity should it arise we have a lot of capital and cash and that would be a great thing for us i dont what was the balance at the fed this quarter robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ph spot average so a lot william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so i dont know that its going to impact our funding costs whatsoever r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good all right thank you very much william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning any updated thoughts on where you think your net interest margin normalizes i think at one point a couple months ago you said it could approach i think it was by the end of next year but updated thoughts on that given the forward curve and your outlook for the mix with balance sheet thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey matt its rob i do recall you asking the question before and the answer is going to be the same which is our nim is increasing we dont manage the nim its an outcome weve operated close to my expectation is that well approach those levels i dont remember saying by the end of but maybe thats something that you added in but were on our way up and is reasonable through time matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and actually maybe it was by the end of i have my ph notes hard to read and then just separately youve always been very strong in commercial lending and some of the few businesses that come from that consumer side has always been a little bit less of a focus but i think youve been leaning in areas like credit card around the edges and just any updated thoughts in terms of what could be growth drivers as we think about consumer lending consumer fees next couple of years thanks william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look weve historically we have underinvested in it and weve under we are under penetrated with our existing clients robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc on consumer william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc on consumer yeah and thats our opportunity set i dont know that we need to be heroic and be go beyond that but we ought to have the same penetration rate that our peers do with respect to our consumer lending and theres fairly material upside should if we could pull that off and were investing to be able to do so robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and weve introduced a new credit card and plans to continue to do that along those lines the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and when do you think youll start well start seeing some of those efforts kick in and we are seeing pretty good credit card volume growth for the industry and at most peers and obviously theres a little bit of a lag but when do you think some of those efforts will be a little bit more evident william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know that i have a timeline on it i would tell you that were invested in people were investing in our credit management capabilities and our marketing and our product delivery all of the above that will hopefully through time allow us to get the penetration we should have i dont know what the timeline is on that but i know its a journey and i know we need to start it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and were matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc beginning now william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ph thats right matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your questions bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks a lot good morning bill and rob following up on your loan growth commentary youve had a lot of success over the years in taking share within ci if we do get a reacceleration in loan growth over say the next year or so how does that influence your ability to continue to take share and perhaps outpace industry growth recognizing your competitors are obviously not willingly ceding share william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 well i think that will show up we are growing dhe and winning new clients at a record pace i think so when utilization comes back ph we ought to as we have in the past my best guess is we would outperform robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah well dhe is our loan commitments william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc theyre ph unfounded at the moment but theyve been put in place and i think the most of the momentum that we see is in our southwest markets where we are achieving record levels and would expect to be above average if it all plays out as we expect william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks thats helpful and then separately on noninterestbearing deposits you expect rates on your interest bearing deposits to decline starting next quarter but how long before youd expect to see the effect of lower rates relating to compensating balances robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yes i dont know thats a tough one to answer i mean what were encouraged about is that weve clearly stabilized now for a couple of quarters at the levels that we are following several quarters of pretty substantial decline so weve stabilized theres a lot of theories in terms of what sort of the magic shortterm rate is that picks that up but no one has a definitive answer bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right but is the credit that you give customers on compensating balances a sort of lever that youd expect to use or be willing to use as you look to grow noninterestbearing deposits just trying to think through whether thats a potential something that could spur growth robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc you should assume that crediting rate is below market versus open deposit rate and so its not going to have a moving beta for some period of time relative to rates coming down the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc its relatively constant and were fine with that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay great and if i could squeeze in one last one if the nii trajectory that you laid out for plays out as anticipated is there any reason why the positive operating leverage commentary that you laid out is very helpful but any reason why the efficiency ratio wouldnt get down into sort of that high range seems like the math would suggest that that could get there but we appreciate your thoughts robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah well have to see bill were in the process of doing our budgeting for next year right now so well have more for you on that in our january call bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next questions come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please proceed with your questions mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i think bill your prior comment that you expect record nii in do you feel more less or just as confident as before and what sort of loan growth do you kind of assume for next year william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we wouldnt have said it if we didnt feel confident to begin with so i dont know levels of confidence but we feel pretty good about it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible confident thats for sure yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and we dont have any growth loan growth in there whatsoever to get to that number mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so no loan growth for next year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no we have something but its robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well we will have something but the record nii level is not reliant on that william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its not dependent on loan growth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then back i know i think last quarter you used the word befuddled as to why loan growth wasnt coming back i guess number one could be the election number two could be private credit number three could be disintermediation of capital markets number four companies could just be managed differently today or number five you could have a weaker economy or it could be all of the above just give us your best stab at why loan growth remains just so weak in an economy thats still growing william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think all of your reasons other than three and four i dont think private is causing utilization rate on middle market companies to remain low for the businesses we play in and im not sure i mean at the margin public markets being wide open has caused some of our larger clients that pay down outstanding balances and hit the capital market so thats probably true at the margin but i this basic notion of people just arent using working capital the way they used to and maybe thats the way they run the company postcovid maybe thats the uncertainty its going to play out over time and we can all guess about it i just dont know the answer so im still befuddled mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then lastly your reserves on office cre were taken even higher especially multitenant last quarter you said the industrys in the first inning i think a lot of people disagree with that im not saying im not sure were two years into this at least and its still a big question mark i think in a lot of peoples minds so when you said the industrys in the first inning and clearly your reserves are higher than others why do you say its only the first inning whats your reasoning william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think were just now starting to clear buildings in sales right weve had some extensions weve had maturities hitting we have a whole slew of term loans in the cmbs market and with small banks that will be out there three four five six years so i just think this plays out over a long period of time but office vacancies pick your market are quite high and were just now realizing the marktomarket value of that as we resolve for profits thats why were reserved where we are and thats why im not worried about it per se from pnc standpoint but no this is going to be noisy for a while the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hi mike indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc early innings william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thatd be early innings robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc early innings yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were not i mean importantly were not in indiscernible were not in early innings with respect to how were reserved yeah i mean you love or hate but to the best of our ability weve taken all that upfront mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then sneaking one more in last one as far as acquisitions i know youd like to buy them on the cheap i mean national city or go down the list its getting tougher for you to buy things on the cheap maybe if you a bank does have a office or cre problem you swoop in there but am i right in thinking its a lot less likely you do an acquisition now that some of these stocks have come back or whats your thinking william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no youre right we dont see value in an acquisition at the moment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess maybe william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just one rob for you as a followup on deposit pricing i think fair amount of uncertainty around how much banks will be able to flex deposit costs lower we got the september cut remind us one around your beta expectations and any early proof points on how customers and especially commercial customers have received the lower rates over the last few weeks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure so were early on just a couple of weeks out from the rate cuts but now were in a down beta cycle weve said that we think that our terminal data will be approximately and we will reduce rates paid to the balance of this year and maybe we get a little bit less than half of the way there by the end of but thats going to play out its early but thats sort of our thinking so rate paid will be coming down particularly in the higher interest bearing commercial deposits some wealth deposits and thats underway and wed expect that to continue ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and on commercial clients so heard you around loan growth and all the reasons why loan growth may or may not pickup if you dont mind just speaking to the health of the commercial customer base and whether like some of the macro data around jobs could be a bit misleading like when you talk to your ci customers are they like are the balance sheets healthy like do they if the fed were to pause rate cuts after a cut or two does that increase the risk for these customers and how they might approach investing hiring et cetera would love any color you can share william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i guess it maybe it varies by industry but a simple notion is companies at the margin are losing margin right they have indiscernible they cant pass on prices the way they want because theyre not making it up in volumes so the discussion of how do i cut costs has at least entered the dialogue but we havent seen that show up in layoffs right the data remains strong and as long as the datas strong consumers are spending then the economys strong so everybodys staring and watching and looking and theres margin pressure on corporates but theres no we dont see in conversations some pending big layoff spike hitting the us economy there are specific industries that are in slumps whether its transportation healthcare struggling ph consumers state at the margin but thats its just at the margin robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and nothing new the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if one last one just following up on mikes question on ma bank transactions usually stock for stock now why i mean your stock has done well why would a deal given your history and track record on deal integration like is it just completely ruled out at this point if theres a willing seller acquiring a good franchise does it no longer make sense just because of pricing william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its i mean the fact that we have a multiple advantage our stock is worth the money it trades at im not sure other stocks are so straight up financial math saying it works doesnt mean its a good deal and when we look at potential targets that would be interesting from certain geographies and so forth they just dont pencil out when you look at their balance sheet and the amount of investment we have to put in the franchise and just the time sync it takes to do it so we and by the way we look at everything i just i dont think the markets anywhere close where wed find something attractive robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc

the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible operator thank you our next questions come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi rob hi bill robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc you guys have done a very good job in managing credit over the years and it shows up again this quarter can we take a look at in the ci portfolio what are the trends that you guys might be seeing in your in the ph snic portfolio or the assetbacked portfolio or the leveraged portfolio the trends pretty benign what are you guys seeing there william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc not much at the margin we still have more downgrades than upgrades very simple ratio across that whole book much of that is driven by margin compression as opposed to anything fundamental with the underlying company but now the economy is healthy and company and our portfolio is healthy well have lumpy oneoffs theres always some story that happens and we had one of those this quarter actually but overall the portfolio feels pretty strong indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc go ahead rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah theyre still very acceptable bookable credits theyre just not as strong as the ultrastrong that they were the last time we rated them william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and i know you touched on this on commercial loan growth about companies might be stronger have you seen any evidence that because of the pandemic because of what companies went through your longtime customers that youve talked to for years do you actually see them better managed or stronger because of what happened during the pandemic william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think that almost has to be true and certainly part of the answer to the utilization question by the way has to be the notion that basically working capital was free for a bunch of years gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and all of a sudden it got expensive so youre looking at places where you could improve margin and youre trying to cut your borrowings and be more efficient at what youre running in inventory and investments so companies did without a lot of stuff during the pandemic and you learn from that and you do try to keep to it so i well see but other broader message is the economys fine companies are fine labor still feels strong a lot of things in the geopolitical horizons that could disrupt that but those are exogenous variables to the basic economy we operate in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just a final followup you gave us some good data of course on the commercial real estate office portfolio what kind of impact or i guess if the cap rates start to come down when do you start to see that be beneficial for the commercial i mean where it could really help you help the values of those properties i know each property is different vacancy rates are critical but is there any kind of point that you guys look at that if the cap rates fell basis points or that would help the valuation process william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look lower cap rates at the margin tends to help i think what youre running into though is youll have office buildings that if theyre vacant theyll hit the market and the question will be can they ever get to normal occupancy through historical absorption rates and if the answer to that is no then the value of that building we just saw one in new york is next to zero if theres a tail on absorption where yes i think i can rehab it and i get this thing back to my normal then it has value as a going concern and its worth something the cap rate almost is irrelevant in those two scenarios if the thing is never going to be occupied it doesnt matter what the cap rates were if its worth land gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good good insights thank you operator thank you we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would now like to hand the call back over to bryan gill for any closing comments bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc
