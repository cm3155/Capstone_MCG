to turn the call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen we had a strong second quarter highlighted by revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in ppnr growth of we maintained strong credit quality and fees rebounded from the first quarter driven primarily by capital markets activity including harris williams and continued growth in card and cash management the strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully loan growth was driven by ci where new production increased significantly and utilization returned to near pre pandemic levels consumer loans also grew driven by mortgage and home equity higher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book in response we continued to reposition the portfolio during the quarter resulting in of our securities portfolio now being held in held to maturity we returned billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends looking forward there is uncertainty in the environment were operating in including the impact of higher rates supply chain disruptions and inflation but regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically we believe having a strong balance sheet a solid mix of feebased businesses continued focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success and our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control along those lines we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter including the buildout of our new bbva and expansion markets modernizing our retail banking technology platform bolstering our asset management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space as ive talked about recently at conferences our performance in the bbva markets has exceeded our own expectations on slide you can see the strong growth weve generated in these markets across customer segments in corporate banking weve seen sales increase linked quarter and maintained a noncredit mix of sales the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 since conversion weve seen similar growth within commercial banking where sales in the bbva usa markets are up linked quarter and noncredit sales to total sales have been approximately since conversion in retail banking weve experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of and respectively and we continue to invest in amg and a big part of that is building a strong customer focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint we have built good momentum in our recruiting efforts over the past few quarters hiring advisers across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients ill close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities moving forward we believe that were well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis during the quarter loan balances averaged billion an increase of billion or investment securities grew approximately billion or and our average cash balances at the federal reserve declined billion deposit balances averaged billion a decline of billion or our tangible book value was per common share as of june a decline linked quarter entirely aocidriven as a function of higher rates and as of june our cet1 ratio was estimated to be given our strong capital ratios we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility during the quarter we returned billion of capital to shareholders through million of common dividends and million of share repurchases or million shares our recent ccar results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders as you know our stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in october is now and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums earlier this year our board of directors authorized a new repurchase framework which allows for up to million common shares of which approximately were still available for repurchase as of june this allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant slide five shows our loans in more detail during the second quarter we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise particularly when compared to growth rates as you know was characterized by low utilization levels ppp loan forgiveness and in pncs case a repositioning of certain acquisitionrelated portfolios loan balances averaged billion an increase of billion or compared to the first quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans excluding ppp grew billion driven by higher new production as well as utilization included in this growth was approximately billion related to highquality shortterm loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year notably in our cib segment the utilization rate increased more than basis points and our overall commitments were higher compared to the first quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 ppp loan balances declined billion and at the end of the quarter were less than billion consumer loans increased billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields increased basis points compared to the first quarter driven by higher interest rates slide six highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter we have a strong core deposit base which is twothirds interestbearing and onethird noninterest bearing within interestbearing are consumer and within noninterestbearing are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits at the end of the second quarter our loanto deposit ratio was which remains well below our prepandemic historic average on the right you can see linkedquarter change in deposits in more detail deposits averaged billion in the second quarter a decline of nearly billion or linked quarter commercial deposits declined billion or primarily in noninterestbearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality average consumer deposits increased seasonally by billion or overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased eight basis points linked quarter to basis points deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast and as a result we now expect our betas to approach by year end compared to our previous expectation of slide details our securities portfolio on an average basis our securities grew million or during the quarter representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment the yield on our securities portfolio increased basis points to driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization on a spot basis our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio as bill mentioned in total we now have of our securities in held to maturity as of june which will help mitigate future aoci impacts from rising interest rates net pretax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled billion at the end of the second quarter this includes billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities turning to the income statement on slide as you can see second quarter reported net income was billion or per share which included pretax integration costs of million excluding integration costs adjusted eps was revenue was up million or compared with the first quarter expenses increased million or resulting in positive operating leverage linked quarter provision was million and our effective tax rate was now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail slide details our revenue trends total revenue for the second quarter of billion increased or million linked quarter net interest income of billion was up million or the benefit of higher yields on interestearning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs and as a result net interest margin increased basis points to second quarter fee income was billion an increase of million or linked quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 looking at the detail of each category asset management and brokerage fees decreased million or reflecting lower average equity markets capital marketrelated fees rebounded as expected and increased million or driven by higher ma ph advisory receipts card and cash management revenue grew million or driven by higher consumer spending activity and increased treasury management product revenue lending and deposit services increased million or reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integrationrelated fee waivers residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was essentially stable linked quarter but higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue finally other noninterest income declined million and included a million visa negative fair value adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes turning to slide our second quarter expenses were up by million or linked quarter driven by increased business activity merit increases and higher marketing spend these increases were partially offset by seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense we remain deliberate around our expense management and as weve previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program and were confident well achieve our fullyear target as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide overall we saw broad improvements across all categories nonperforming loans of billion decreased million or compared to march and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies were billion on june a million decline linked quarter reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies which included the resolution of acquisitionrelated administrative and operational delays net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million a decrease of million linked quarter driven by lower consumer net chargeoffs primarily within the auto portfolio our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans continues to be historically low at basis points and during the second quarter our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable and our reserves now total billion or of total loans in summary pnc reported a solid second quarter and were well positioned for the second half of as we continue to realize the potential of our coasttocoast franchise in regard to our view of the overall economy we expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of resulting in average annual real gdp growth we also expect the fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of to by year end looking at the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of we expect average loan balances to be up to we expect net interest income to be up to we expect noninterest income to be down to which results in total revenue increasing to we expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up and we expect third quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 considering our reported operating results for the first half of third quarter expectations and current economic forecast for the full year compared to the full year we expect average loan growth of approximately by an loan growth on a spot basis we expect total revenue growth to be to our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in april however relative to our expectations at that time we now expect more net interest income from higher rates offset by somewhat lower fees we expect expenses excluding integration expense to be up to and we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys how are you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning gerard william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc rob can you elaborate a little further on the deposit beta change is it purely just the rate of change in interest rates going up so fast or is there a deposit mix thats also influencing your new outlook for the beta robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey good morning gerard yeah probably both but a little bit more the former were just at that point now where were seeing rates rising to the point where the betas are becoming active they were not that active on the consumer side a little bit on the commercial side in the first quarter and thats picked up a bit more on the commercial side as we expected and in our case its our nonoperating deposits that explains the decline there in the second quarter so betas are beginning to move we expected that and were ready for it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good credit quality obviously was quite strong for you folks similar to the prior quarter and bill i dont know i know theres a lot of uncertainty out there with whats going on in the world but it just seems that for your the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 company at least you are so well positioned from a credit quality standpoint and is it are we just going to go off a cliff or something at the end of the year with some sort of big recession that has frightened everybody about credit quality for banks in general and any elaboration on your outlook on credit and the outlook for the economy william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah look i dont think theres any cliff involved i do think that the trouble ahead lies somewhere in the middle of next year not any time in the next six months but what youre seeing inside of our credit book you got to remember that during this period of time we continue to kind of run off a higher risk book from bbva and our loan growth is largely in higher quality names so the overall quality of our book actually improves quarter on quarter eventually that has to stop and eventually i think the fed has to slow the economy to a pace to get inflation under control and i think thats going to be harder to do than the market currently assumes and i think its going to take longer than the market currently assumes and when that happens were going to see credit costs go up at least back to what we would call normalized levels but i dont think i dont see any particular bubbles inside of the banking system as it relates to credit i think youre just going to see a slow grind with credit losses increasing over time as we get into the slowdown robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and some gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc im sorry what was that rob im sorry robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i was saying just and bill mentioned it gerard just some normalization which is inevitable gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes no agreed thank you guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator and our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob there was a time where you talked about increasing the mix of your securities given all the liquidity in the system but as the fed engages in qt and with the strong loan growth that youre seeing could we see you go the other way and perhaps redeploy some of your securities portfolio the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 paydowns to fund more of your growth such that you actually remix more a larger mix of your earning assets towards loans william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think over time that is probably likely if we continue to see loan growth the way we do but you shouldnt mix security balances with the way we think about fixed rate exposure hedging our deposits right securities are one way we do that swaps are another way and then of course our fixed rate assets themselves and then inside of that the duration of the securities we buy so long story short the balances probably decline but were sitting in a period of time right now where were very assetsensitive youll notice our balances basically stayed flat through the course of the quarter as we kind of purposely watch and let things roll off here given our view on what we think longer term rates are going to ultimately do so balances could go down just as a matter of sort of algebra in the balance sheet but our ability to invest in rising rates is still there in a large way robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes thats right look the context bill as you know the context of your question is historically pre sort of the rapid increase in liquidity over the last couple of years we did run about of our securities to our earning assets we raised that because of all the liquidity in the system so were still pretty high on a historical basis but as bill demchak just said thats not likely to change anytime soon bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and separately as the fed proceeds through the hiking cycle at some point i think as youve both alluded to in your comments thats going to presumably slow the pace of growth but youre taking your loan growth guidance higher for the year maybe could you speak to how much of that improved outlook is idiosyncratic because it certainly does sound like youre expecting a deceleration at some point at the macro level william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc a lot of it just comes from our ability to win new business utilization rates have largely approached where we were i think rob prepandemic at this point robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so theres a little bit of room there but these new markets and our just our ability to win new business and by the way new business that is feebased is pretty strong and we feel confident well be able to continue to do that independent of what happens in the economy the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes and i would just add to that in terms of the loan growth outlook for the months were up a bit mostly because of the outperformance in the first half relative to our expectations so thats sort of truing up so to speak bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and if i could squeeze in one last one i think its interesting bill to think about your commentary around the normalization of credit as the fed proceeds through its hiking cycle and sort of we think about the long and variable lags that between monetary policy and when that ultimately starts to show up in credit and then you sort of juxtapose that with whats happening with reserve rates which its notable that for most of your peers theyve drifted below their day one levels and i know for you guys theres a bbva deal and lots of other moving parts but that seems relatively conservative how are you thinking about the trajectory of that from here in the context of the thought process you just laid out of the fed hiking cycle eventually leading to credit normalization probably as we get into maybe the middle of next year or somewhere in that timeframe william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats an impossible question to answer given the dynamics of cecl but you should assume we assume that all else equal credit quality is going to deteriorate at some pace from here through the next two years i just dont think its going to be all that dramatic and it almost has to be a true statement given the chargeoff levels that weve been seeing robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right and i would add to that our reserve levels are above our day one cecl even adjusted for the bbva acquisition were appropriately reserved and feel good about it bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions operator and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey guys just wanted to just ask to dissect a little bit rob you mentioned that your outlook for nii is a little bit better your outlook for fees a little softer the nii one i think we get just wondering if you can help us understand now what kind of curve youre building in and is it more just that uptick of rates that offsets that new beta outcome robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right good morning ken yeah thats exactly right so higher rate environment nii and the balances that weve generated contribute to the improved nii look and then you sort of referenced it in terms of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 the fees mostly in terms of our fullyear expectations compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year and last quarter some softer on amg and mortgage as you would expect with the equity markets performing like they are for amg and interest rates on the mortgage side so its sort of the tradeoff of the higher rates ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it right sorry i missed your comment from earlier so thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies company and then just on the fee side then you had a really good bounce back as you expected especially in that capital market so whats your whats changed there in terms of what youre seeing as far as the outlook on the fee side robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so on the fee side again for the full year most of the change relative to our full year expectations is within amg and mortgage on capital markets youll recall we had a soft first quarter relative to our expectations we did see the bounce back in the second quarter so were back in position with our full year expectations in the second half obviously remains to be seen ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay and if i could just sneak one more in you mentioned bill you mentioned all the different ways that you can get exposure to variable rates and such im just wondering how are you guys thinking about just swaps portfolio you had done some adds in terms of protecting and managing the nearterm upside versus the potential of what happens down the road based on fed funds futures curve expectations and your general view of the economy thanks guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we dont think about the swaps book separate from our basic investing and fixed rate exposure where we sit across the securities book and swaps and everything we do fixed rate were looking at a curve now where i kind of think the yearend rates in my own mind are probably largely right but i think theres a i think the assumption that the fed is going to start easing in the spring of next year is absurd which means were holding off at this point because we think theres going to be theres still value to be had in the longer end of the curve as people come to the realization that inflation isnt as easy to tame as people might assume and separately that the fed isnt going to immediately cut simply because the economy slows if inflation is still running high so were going to sit pat but its not we dont think swaps are one thing in bonds or another we just we look at our interest rate exposure were very assetsensitive we have an opportunity to deploy in multiple places were just not doing it weve basically let everything run down thus far this year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company understood okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning im sure this is the question that ken asked but i just wanted to clarify the loan growth expectation rose the performance has been spectacular the revenues didnt move even though we had the higher loan growth and the higher rate outlook and thats because of the higher beta assumed and also lower fees rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well in part i think the earlier question you might have missed it erika was the improved outlook for the fullyear loan growth the answer was most of that was a trueup to our outperformance in the first half so we grew loans faster than we thought we would in the first six months which is great so we trueup that fullyear expectation so all of that is built into the fullyear guidance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc part of the impact that were seeing in nii and nim is actually on our loan yields where the quality of our book as it improves fairly substantially weve put a lot of very highgrade stuff on and spreads have actually come in quarter on quarter so when we look at the out forecast on nii together with loan growth which will be pretty healthy we have in there embedded in there this notion that spreads are tighter than ph we they were is we basically improve the quality of the book robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc just another component william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just as a followup question how should we think about deposit growth from here bill i think youve been the one that has been vocal about the notion that if loan growth is positive deposit growth should be positive how should we weigh that relative to probably your willful desire to work out the nonoperating deposits out of your balance sheet and qt william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 yeah well its a good question and the answer remains to be seen a little bit weve clearly seen the larger corporates move liquidity out of the banking system into money markets government money markets and i think as we go forward the combination of qt from the fed and what they do with their repo facility is going to drive some of the yields available in those funds which in turn is going to drive how much of that sits on banks balance sheets or not outside of those deposits its more about a rate paid game and i think deposits kind of inside of the retail space and the smaller midmarket commercial space i think deposits actually grow simply because of the loan volume but the mix shift that weve seen in commercial from a little bit less noninterestbearing into interestbearing that games going to play out so thus far i mean if you look at total liquidity in the system it really hasnt moved and of course the fed hasnt really started their qt program yet what weve seen is a movement of liquidity from banks into money funds as money fund yields started to grow so this is going to take a while to play out robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes and our expectations erika are generally stable but that bill pointed the mix could be different and an open question on the nonoperational deposits which well either do or not do william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah a big part of what weve seen go thus far are kind of deposits that we dont really care about they were we kind of call them surge deposits internally which were noncore clients parking liquidity that now have kind of gone into funds robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and importantly are by definition low margin william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my last question bill you said earlier you dont really see any bubbles within the banking system i think a lot of investors are more concerned about whats outside of the banking system and interestingly im sure you know this statistic very well corporate lending in terms of the bank share of it has declined to i guess my question to you is do you see an opportunity as rates rise and the economy slows down is some of that market share available back to banks in terms of whats happened in the private market or was that never credit that you wanted to do anyway and dont you have a unit within pnc that does thirdparty recoveries in terms of if you have corporate defaults you could be a thirdparty recoverer if thats the term the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah well first i want to see the audit on only of corporate credit being inside of banks but im sure theres some way you can indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph the other way all right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no we as credit outside of the banking system melts we play in that in two ways one is if its in the real estate space we do that inside of our special servicing arm in midland two is we are very good at working corporate credits and we wouldnt be afraid of buying portfolios of troubled assets and three and i think this is what youre referring to is in our assetbased lending group we play the role of senior lender on a very secured basis for and basically the agent for the entire capital structure and as pieces below us struggle the fee opportunity for us to work those loans out on behalf of the b lenders is quite high furthermore we continue to be approached by multiple b lenders to basically run their books as they look at whats coming their way thus far we havent agreed to do any of that and were we to do it i think itd be quite lucrative robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and weve done that in the past william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it right thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great i guess all these questions get down to nim so are you forecasting deposits to run off for the year because youve mentioned betas are starting to move and i missed the updated guidance because youre guiding for good nii growth so how much deposit runoff are you assuming in your deposit growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i can jump on that and we covered some of that mike generally speaking and we recognize the fluidity for the second half were calling for stable deposits some mix change between noninterestbearing and interest bearing also an open question in terms of nonoperational deposits and what betas are required for that and whether we choose to keep those or not so that all remains to be seen but the outlook is stable and nim we do expect to expand mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and you talked about tighter loan yield spreads just because youre going up in quality are you getting rewarded for this more uncertain outlook i mean capital markets some assets are pricing at near recession levels but i feel like the lending markets are not doing the same and are you getting more spread for the added chance of a recession william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it depends on the lending sector so we are for example an assetbased straight spreads on highrated stuff has kind of stabilized a lot of what were seeing is just a mix shift in the quality of our book not a change in the market in terms of spread where i think the market continues to be irrational is on the consumer side so auto lending seems in our view to be a little bit of a bubble and some of the things were still seeing being done on the consumer side but on the corporate side on the real estate side the shift is moving back towards the banks in terms of our ability to negotiate and get spread and get covenants and get structure just not a dramatic shift the way youve seen in some of the headline stuff on capital marketsrelated issues mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so youre getting some of that bill can you put this in context this looks like the fastest commercial loan growth in years and we havent had a cycle like this in quite some time and i guess im repeating i think what youve said in the past its inventory its credit utilization its capital expenditures its working capital some business from capital markets back to the banks did i miss anything there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 no i mean its thank you for reminding i mean thats what happened right weve had inventory build and capex and a little volume back to the banks and boom you get big loan growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah in particular and it overlaps mike particularly on the utilization which has grown william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah but thats coming off of their inventory build which robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph it overlaps mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the one i didnt mention that some other banks have mentioned you did not so i dont want to lead the witness here but in terms of gaining share from nonbanks because youre seeing some nonbank entities not on a solid footing as they were in the past are you gaining share from them do you expect to gain share from them are there opportunities to do so are you shifting resources because i get it youre the national main street bank youre in msas william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you have a lot on your plate to try and gain share in all those markets meanwhile you have some verticals where you might be able to gain share what are you doing to try to capitalize on that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike most of those players play in a risk bucket that we dont like to play in right so the exception to that is in our assetbased lending book where borrowers who might have been able to do a cash flow loan with a bdc at one point are now going to come back to the banks and do it assetbased but on the consumer side the guys who are out there playing subprime consumer or even in the leverage lending side cash flow unsecured we just dont have a big book of business there nor do we want one mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and my last one just on cecl you didnt i mean you beat on credit your credit is great youve always been high quality you proved it through the global financial crisis we get it but with all this talk about a recession out there doesnt that give you cover to go ahead and increase reserves i get it youre above day one cecl but why not just take more reserves out of conservatism the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well its we have a model and we run by a model so were not allowed to just robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc as much as id like to sometimes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc put my thumb on the scale were not robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc we dont do that we dont do that cecl is a modeldriven approach and as you pointed out mike were above our day one were appropriately reserved relative to our book mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc morning john robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi john the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the commercial loan growth topic and sorry if i missed the detail on it but i know you mentioned the billion in highquality shortterm loans that were brought on that you expect to mature in the second half can you give a little bit of color on that on those balances and what drove it and maybe a little bit in terms of outlook could you see additional flows in that type of lending as well thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc wed like to see additional flows in that type of lending robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its kind of that was client a handful of clients but clientspecific timing issues that we were able to serve client needs and theyre big balances and theyre going to run off robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and wed like to do that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah that happens again thats great but these were specific ones we called out both because of their size and also because theyre lower spreads than the rest of the book and that had some impact on the loan yield this quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then also related to that in what areas do you expect that you could see some moderation in commercial loan demand as we do get some slowing in economic activity if the fed succeeds here with the tightening william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc eventually what youre going to see weve seen utilizations go up as people have built inventories now that will reverse itself as we get into a slowdown and people struggle to move inventories it will peak and then theyll grind it to a halt but i think thats going to end up being the driver well continue to go work and gain share and ultimately against the money we put out we look at what happens to utilizations and utilizations will start to drop through a slowdown peak early into it and then slow down as they try to free up working capital the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks bill and then back to the loan loss reserve front i hear you again in terms of the adequacy of your reserve in your scenarios did your economic scenarios that you run that support cecl did they get worse at all versus last quarter or did they like how did that change and then separately did you have any reallocations within the reserve that were noteworthy like coming from commercial going into consumer if you can maybe talk about that so just trying to get a better feel of your confidence william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah without getting into the details of cecl i would tell you that within our overall provision we added to reserves as a function of the scenarios we run robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean its pretty stable john so no big mix changes no big dollar changes the percentage came down a little bit just because of largely the high credit quality large underwritings we just spoke about improving the mix so pretty much unchanged john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well no so john pancari q analyst evercore isi go ahead robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc clarify that in terms of the dollar amounts in the stable but inside of that obviously our scenarios build in some worsening concepts but theres qfrs as part of that process that offset that so end of the day stable john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay all right thanks rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 operator and our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just one follow up rob in terms of as we think about the outlook for deposit betas and margins if the fed stops at the end of the year you talked about the deposit beta and deposit growth expectations in the back half but give us a sense of the asset sensitivity profile of the balance sheet in a world where the fed stops hiking the remains inverted for to months and as bill alluded to we may not get cuts as quickly in that backdrop do you still expect the margin to drift higher or do we start seeing some liability sensitivity where deposits are repricing higher but youre not seeing the benefit on the asset side robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes yes we dont give explicit nim outlook but i would say your question is when does nim peak we see nims continuing to expand and peaking in so with everything that you described we still see upside in nim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it so safe to assume that even in a backdrop where the fed stops hiking the nim should still at least drift higher a bit for a few more quarters so point noted robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes possibly and again were in sort of that context were talking about then ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes and i didnt mean to pin you down or ask for guidance im just trying to conceptually think if we go into this period where weve not been where the curve remains flat to inverted for a while what that does to the nim and its not unique to you but appreciate the color robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes you have to the number of pieces that are moving inside of that even if lets assume they get out there and they just freeze and you have a small inversion in the curve and you sit there in that instance betas probably dont move from wherever they were post the last hike and instead what youre going to see is a increase in fixed rate asset yields that basically roll off from very low yields into higher yields and then the upside to the extent we want to deploy at that point so you see a gain in yields inside of the security book in a static environment simply because everything that was purchased with handles rolls off robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes thats right thats why were still some part some ways from the peak ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats fair i appreciate the perspective and on the lending side just still wanted to follow up on two things one like do you have a sense of where customers are in terms of rebuilding inventories like thats been a big driver of growth for the last two to three quarters but compared to prepandemic are customer inventories back to those levels like how would you frame that and secondly would love to hear your thoughts about just outlook for the commercial real estate market in this backdrop especially if we get a recession youve been cautious in the past so would love to hear your thoughts william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the inventory question is all over the place because you have a bunch of customers who have more inventory than they want and you have others who are still struggling to build inventory to keep up with supply because of continued supply chain disruption so i dont know that theres a simple answer on inventories real estate with the exception of the slow burn on office where we just we continue to be worried we continue to see slow deterioration we think were really well reserved but absent that kind of slow burn the rest of it continues to kind of do okay to improve and i think that holds even at least on the slowdown thats in the back of my mind again i just dont see some big spike into a really ugly recession so we have our eye on real estate we have exposure into the office space that were reserved against its kind of doing what we expected and beyond that were not particularly worried about it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and to your point were well reserved and multifamily which is the biggest component of that is very strong ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick one sorry if i missed it did you talk about the pace of buybacks how we should think about that in the back half of the year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i did in my opening comments were going to continue buying back shares roughly at the average rate of what weve been doing the last couple of quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning as we think about loan loss reserves in call it a moderate recession how high or how much add do you think you have to do i think for covid it was around billion ex the day one cecl impact but obviously theres been a mix shift the bbva deal and a lot of factors but as you guys run your stress tests what would cumulative reserve bill be for a moderate recession william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no way to answer that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i was going to say bill said there was an earlier impossible question yes that one might be number two william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but matt i mean remember that reserve build in covid right the scenarios we were running i dont remember off the top of my head ph it was unemployment to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc or higher william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc gdp were not this has nothing to do with that right were going to go into a slowdown and were going to see an increase in reserves at some point but theyre not even going to be related to the thing we saw when covid hit the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible economy down yeah just in terms of size so you almost have to take that whole example set and remove it from the framework of how you think about provisions going forward matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right so it seems like youre implying and weve heard it from some others that it should be a lot less but i guess well see william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no no i cant i mean robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc only if you think about what those forecasts were right i mean do you remember they were unemployment going to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean it was i dont think theres anybody out there who thinks we have to crater the economy by that amount to get inflation under control that was look there could be some world event that causes that but its not going to be a function of the fed raising rates and slowing the economy to get inflation under control matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah agreed i mean obviously thats what the markets still worried about and its just interesting if you put it relative to capital even if you did what you did for covid its only basis points of capital so thats helpful william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 look youre bringing up this whole issue is the issue i think that investors just have completely wrong about the banking system right now if you look at the market cap thats been pulled out of the banking system and take your worst case reserve build and chargeoffs through some cycle its just wildly wrong yes well have increased losses but robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc not to that extent william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc not to anything close like what weve put in during covid and more importantly i think theres a growth opportunity through a mild downturn for us just given the way we run our business and the business it will come back into the banking systems and out of the capital markets so im personally confused about all the concern that sits out there on banking reserves and the coming recession and the impacts on the profitability of banks it will hurt a little bit but robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well and to your point if its being extrapolated from covid scenarios william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its just again thats a data point they need to remove robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just the flip side youve got a little over billion of losses in oci obviously a lot of that comes back over time the part thats related to the bond book just give us a rule of thumb like how much of that accretes back each year if rates stay here on the kind of the medium longerterm part of the curve william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well the heldtomaturity accretes back independent of rates at this point and i dont know you guys indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc have we disclosed that bryan its a couple of hundred million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc yeah you could say that yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean the way we kind of think about it internally given how much we moved is we ought to have pulled a par on the heldtomaturity book adding to our capital base at a pace that largely hedges us against further declines in aoci in the availableforsale book depending how much of a spike the rates are versus the rolled ph up but we feel pretty good about the mix we have at this point and obviously its not impacting our capital flexibility visàvis the way we look at aoci inside of regulatory capital matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes and i guess what i was asking is like if we just think over the next few years right like all that oci eventually gets reversed back as the bonds mature william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc you are saddled with billion of losses like a lot of banks having a drag im just wondering whats a good rule of thumb does that billion come back kind of maybe billion billion a year or something like that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean lets see weve got a duration in ph the book of years or something robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well the short answer is approximately million a quarter billion a year so thats the number youre looking for but thats the right neighborhood william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sorry thats out of the held to maturity robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc held to maturity yes the held to maturity william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 and we have a separate aoci loss in available for sale robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is dependent on rates right bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc ph and on markets yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks just one follow up on that on the afs book i guess the underlying question is is the duration roughly the same as the htm book i get that rates will move that mark around but lets say rates never change is it the same duration as htm robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah roughly yes roughly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah okay and then just separately i know theres a lot of questions earlier about deposits et cetera and im just wondering your loantodeposit ratio i think today is around maybe and in it was at so theres lots of room there in the ldr im wondering how you think about it are you happy to go back to in the near term or is there a trajectory or a pace that youre comfortable with william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look if its high quality wed love to go back to if its in our risk box and coupled with client relationships where we have really strong crosssell that would be a great outcome robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph well and that also relates to the deposit pricing and what we choose to do betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 right robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so yeah youre right we have room and flexibility there as we go through these increased betas and a growing loan environment betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so part of the question is just trying to get a sense as to the pace of ldr increase you kind of control with the deposit pricing robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so you could let a lot more run off before you started to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah thats my point thats the flexibility so we can and we can view these deposits in terms of whether we want to pay for them william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no i dont think i mean look our intention here is to keep deposits and grow deposits if we can without having to be aggressive on rate its very simple and inside of that wed like to grow loans and if we manage to do the two things there and grow loan to deposits to well be making a boatload of money given the fee mix we get when we grow loans robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats a good indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc great thing to be able to do and were going to work on it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes well i mean i guess part of the question is you dont have to be more competitive on deposit rate right now you could wait a few more quarters and then move robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes thats what i said william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i wanted to follow up just because bill youre just you seem so adamant that the market cap thats been taken out of your stock far exceeds credit loss hits that you have in a scenario so a personal question youve owned a lot of stock for a long time you have a lot of skin in the game at what point would you put more skin in the game and buy some shares we havent seen that i think by any bank ceo and if you think this is such a dislocation and you think its so unlikely to have some kind of deep recession global financial crisis pandemic sort of situation have you thought about that i mean would you do that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think about it all the time i dont know when i go into details on my own financial situation but i see a lot of value there its interesting weve had a bunch of senior execs actually enroll in our employee stock purchase plan robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 which maybe is a simple way for me to get a few shares here and there but look i think theres a lot of value i dont know that youre going to see me make a giant purchase because as you said i own a lot of stock and its most of my net worth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just an extra tone for the top but i guess you said it on the call william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just one more time on that question again you have this disconnect between pricing the capital markets with some other areas and your own expectations so what you were saying before is that the power or the control has gone back to the banks from the borrower in terms of terms and structure maybe not the same degree of pricing though and im just its that pricing element that its tough for you or anyone to really know how much you should be pricing these loans if you think we might be going into a recession so how do you get to that level william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look i mean pricing ultimately is marketdriven i would expect for a given credit quality were going to see small backup of course pricing is also based on a grid so as we go into a slower economy and people run another turn of leverage given their performance well see jumps in spreads thats built into the existing contract because spreads are performance based in a lot of the loans that we do so well get there more important to us mike is the crosssell that we ultimately get at the end loan pricing as long as we get good structure pricing is important but pricing along with the majority of the tm relationship and capital markets business really ups the return that you get from that client relationship mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and theres a structure component theres a lot of good companies out there that dont have structures that we would lend into that they could change that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then i guess one more just in terms of your msas or your newer markets your bbva markets do you have any metrics on what market share you have there versus your legacy franchise because that would size the opportunity the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its small robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes yes big opportunity william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc opportunity is big robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so big that we dont even worry about that right now we just need to do more mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks a lot william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator there are no further questions william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks everybody robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice
