restrictions resulting in business shutdowns regional quarantines disruptions of supply chains changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability although vaccines for covid19 have been made available to the general public in the united states and many places around the world vaccination rates vary and effectiveness may decrease over time we cannot predict how widely utilized the vaccines and boosters will be or whether and for how long they will be effective in preventing the spread of covid19 including its variants although we cannot predict when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume we observed general declines in the level of economic uncertainty and stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts during the first three quarters of the us experienced an uptick in the number of new cases during the third quarter of we are unable to predict whether these trends will continue and how this will affect the overall economy at the current

results of operations net interest income and margin taxableequivalent basis third quarter compared to third quarter taxableequivalent net interest income totaled million for the third quarter of a decrease of million or compared to the third quarter of the decline in net interest income was driven primarily by a decline in the yield on interestearning assets due to the sustained low rate environment and a reduction in interest and fee income on sbappp loans these declines were partially offset by organic loan growth higher average investment balances as we have deployed some of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet and a decline in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits sbappp loans contributed million in interest and fee income for the third quarter of compared to million for the same quarter in while sbappp loans continue to support overall net interest income the contribution from these loans continues to decline as forgiveness activity continues net interest income increased million compared to the linked quarter despite a decline in sbappp income and continued low interest rates higher investment and overnight yields and balances organic loan growth and slightly lower deposit costs more than offset rate pressure on loans and a decline in sbappp income sbappp loans contributed million in interest and fee income for the second quarter of the taxableequivalent nim was in the third quarter of a decrease of basis points from the comparable quarter of the margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix driven by excess liquidity and higher balances in overnight investments as well as declines in loan yields these declines were partially offset by lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and increased yield on sbappp loans as with prior quarters we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges which puts downward pressure on net interest margin the level of organic loan growth has helped to somewhat protect taxable equivalent nim from the impacts of the low interest rate environment we have also opportunistically deployed incremental liquidity of billion into the investment portfolio since the third quarter of the taxableequivalent nim declined basis points from for the linked quarter primarily due to changes in earning asset mix as our overnight investments continued to grow

impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities on a periodic basis we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where bancshares is required to file income tax returns as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors interestearning assets interestearning assets include overnight investments investment securities and loans and leases all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk we strive to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets totaled billion and billion at september and december respectively the billion increase was primarily composed of a billion increase in overnight investments and a million increase in investment securities partially offset by a million decrease in loans investment securities the primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk and low to moderate interest rate risk other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with bancshares objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments conversely when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and shortterm borrowings we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand see note c investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures the carrying value of investment securities totaled billion at

management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were

a conservative approach to risk taking with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares activities may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition the board of directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing measuring monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the board of directors role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board of directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the board of directors regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks information security and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an adequate acl that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio we continue to actively monitor our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of the covid19 pandemic and to date have not seen any significant declines in credit quality through september over of all covid19 related loan extensions have begun repayment additionally we participated in both rounds of funding in the sbappp program which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers at september bancshares had billion in sbappp loans outstanding interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates market interest rates have increased since yearend driven by improving economic conditions table provides the impact on net interest income over months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of september and december table net interest income sensitivity analysis estimated percentage decrease increase in net interest income change in interest rate basis points september december net interest income sensitivity metrics as of september remain largely unchanged when compared to december longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario resulting in variations in eve the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table presents the eve profile as of september and december table economic value of equity modeling analysis estimated percentage decrease increase in eve change in interest rate basis points september december the economic value of equity metrics at september compared to december were primarily affected by ongoing growth in nonmaturity deposits during coupled with higher market interest rates we do not typically utilize interest rate swaps floors collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk libor transition in the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that after it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the london interbank offered rate libor subsequent announcements have delayed the potential date for certain libor tenors until june we continue to transition away from libor in order to cease issuance of loans indexed to libor by december conforming and nonconforming adjustable rate mortgage originations transitioned to alternative rates in the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred alternative to libor we have introduced sofr as an alternative rate for other business lines in mid2021 we do not expect a material financial impact to bancshares or our customers from this transition liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks that can affect an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary funding source is our branchgenerated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost sources of liquidity include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the federal reserve bank and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at september compared to billion at december another source of available funds is advances from the fhlb of atlanta outstanding fhlb advances were million as of september and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta also at september billion in nonpcd loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds lines and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at september offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we are a party to certain financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk which we enter into in order to meet the financing needs of our customers these offbalance sheet instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit for more information on these commitments see note n commitments
