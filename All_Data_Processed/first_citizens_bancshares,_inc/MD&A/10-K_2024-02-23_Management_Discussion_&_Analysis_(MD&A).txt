periods were not impacted by this update information about our segments is included in note 23business segment information and in the section entitled results by business segment in this mda recent economic and industry developments during the first half of the fomc continued to raise its target for the federal funds rate in an effort to combat inflation the fomc raised interest rates at each of its january march may and july meetings by bps however the fomc did not raise interest rates during its june september and december meetings and the benchmark federal funds rate was maintained at a range between although future rate hikes are possible there is optimism that the fomcs interest rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle and the federal reserve has signaled it may cut rates in the fomc reported that it will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments and the effects of their earlier rate increases in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to over time although the fomc has made progress combating inflation efforts to control inflation have raised concerns over the possibility of a recession in addition geopolitical events including the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east are likely to maintain upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity also mortgage rates increased during and mortgage demand from homebuyers softened the timing and impact of inflation volatility in the stock market rising interest rates and a possible recession will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict early in the banking industry experienced increased volatility resulting in the failure of multiple regional banking institutions these failures have increased industry concerns related to capital and liquidity deposit outflows uninsured deposit concentrations and unrealized losses on investment securities more recently there is growing concern in the banking industry about the exposure to certain sectors of cre and credit trends in these exposures may deteriorate the federal banking agencies issued several notices of proposed rulemaking npr that if andor when finalized may impact bancshares and fcb the fdic finalized an npr covering a special assessment to recover losses associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank the federal banking agencies issued an npr covering enhanced capital requirements and one discussing the requirement to maintain a certain level of longterm debt these nprs are discussed above in item business of this annual report on form 10k in the section entitled regulatory

deposit costs reflecting increased rates and a higher average balance due to the svbb acquisition and deposit growth in the direct bank and higher borrowing costs primarily due to the purchase money note net interest margin nim for the current year was an increase of bps compared to for the prior year the increase in nim was related to the increases in nii discussed above provision for credit

by business and commercial loan growth in the general banking segment and growth in the commercial banking segment across certain industry verticals total investment securities at december were

million in the current year compared to million in the prior year interest income earned on investment securities for the current year was million an increase of million or from million for the prior year the increase was due to higher reinvestment rates and a higher average balance interest income earned on interestearning deposits at banks for the current year was billion an increase of billion from million for the prior year the increase was fairly balanced between the impact from the higher average balance and from the higher federal funds rate the higher average balance reflected the

we maintained competitive rates offered to customers higher average balances due to the svbb acquisition and organic growth primarily in savings accounts in the direct bank interest expense on

income on operating leases and adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment are utilized to measure the profitability of our rail segment adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment is calculated as rental income on operating lease equipment reduced by depreciation maintenance and other operating lease expenses maintenance and other operating lease expenses relate to equipment ownership and leasing costs associated with the rail segment portfolio and tend to be variable due to the nature of our portfolio which is essentially all operating lease equipment certain financial

associated net rental income net income rental income on operating leases and adjusted rental income on operating leases for the current year were million million and million respectively rail segment net income for the current year decreased from the prior year as the higher interest rate environment increased interest expense which offset the higher rental income on operating lease equipment rental income on operating leases increased largely as a result of a higher number of rail cars owned and leased higher utilization and strong repricing railcar depreciation is recognized on a

objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into interestearning deposits at banks conversely when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and shortterm borrowings we allow

with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities commensurate with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive risk management framework and risk appetite framework and statement senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees our board strives to ensure that risk management is a part of our business culture and that our policies and procedures for identifying assessing monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the boards role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board administers its risk oversight function primarily through its risk committee the risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the full board regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance asset strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite statement and

relies assessments have not identified material impacts to date but those assessments will remain ongoing as the conditions continue to exist bancshares is also assessing the potential risk of an economic slowdown or recession that could create increased credit and market risk having downstream impacts on earnings capital andor liquidity while economic data continues to be mixed baseline economic forecasts currently reflect a more marked decline in cre properties due to current interest rate levels that impacted the alll forecasts key indicators will continue to be monitored and impacts assessed as part of our ongoing risk management framework credit risk credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an appropriate alll that accounts for expected losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolios commercial lending and leasing bancshares employs a credit ratings system where each commercial loan is assigned a probability of default loss given default andor overall credit rating using scorecards developed to rate each type of transaction incorporating assessments of both quantitative and qualitative factors when commercial loans and leases are graded during underwriting or when updated periodically thereafter a model is run to generate a preliminary risk rating these models incorporate both internal and external historical default and loss data as well as other borrower and loan characteristics to assign a risk rating the preliminary risk rating assigned by the model can be adjusted as a result of borrower specific facts and circumstances that in managements judgment warrant a modification of the modeled risk rating to arrive at the final approved risk ratings consumer lending consumer lending begins with an evaluation of a consumer borrowers credit profile against published standards credit decisions are made after analyzing quantitative and qualitative factors including borrowers ability to repay the loan collateral values and considering the transaction from a judgmental perspective consumer products use traditional and measurable standards to document and assess the creditworthiness of a loan applicant credit standards follow industry standard documentation requirements performance is largely evaluated based on an acceptable pay history along with a quarterly assessment which incorporates current market conditions loans may also be monitored during quarterly reviews of the borrowers refreshed credit score when warranted an additional review of the loantovalue of the underlying collateral may be conducted our alll estimate as of december included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the uncertainties around macroeconomic forecasts these loss estimates consider industry risk and the actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress as well as recent credit

exchange forward contracts as part of our overall risk management practices and also on behalf of our clients we establish risk metrics and evaluate and manage the counterparty risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the comprehensive risk management framework and risk appetite framework and statement counterparty credit exposure or counterparty risk is a primary risk of derivative instruments relating to the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under the derivative contract we seek to control credit risk of derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals preestablished exposure limits and monitoring procedures which are integrated with our cash and issuer related credit processes the applicable chief credit officer or delegate approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis of each counterparty derivative agreements for bancshares risk management purposes and for the hedging of client transactions are executed with major financial institutions and are settled through the major clearing exchanges which are rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies credit exposure is mitigated via the exchange of collateral between the counterparties covering marktomarket valuations client related derivative transactions which are primarily related to lending activities are incorporated into our loan underwriting and reporting processes asset risk asset risk is a form of price risk that is a primary risk of our leasing businesses this relates to the risk of earning capital arising from changes in the value of owned leasing equipment asset risk in our leasing business is evaluated and managed in the divisions and overseen by risk management processes in our assetbased lending business we also use residual value guarantees to mitigate or partially mitigate exposure to end of lease residual value exposure on certain of our finance leases our business process consists of setting residual values at transaction inception systematic periodic residual value reviews and monitoring levels of residual realizations residual realizations by business and product are reviewed as part of the quarterly financial and asset quality review reviews for impairment are performed at least annually in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices asset risk is monitored through reviews of the equipment markets including utilization rates and traffic flows the evaluation of supply and demand dynamics the impact of new technologies and changes in regulatory requirements on different types of equipment at a high level demand for equipment is correlated with gross domestic product gdp growth trends for the markets the equipment serves as well as the more immediate conditions of those markets cyclicality in the economy and shifts in trade flows due to specific events represent risks to the earnings that can be realized by these businesses for instance in the rail segment bancshares seeks to mitigate these risks by maintaining a relatively young fleet of assets which can bolster attractive lease and utilization rates market risk interest rate risk management bancshares is exposed to the risk that changes in market conditions may affect interest rates and negatively impact earnings the risk arises from the nature of bancshares business activities the composition of bancshares balance sheet and changes in the level or shape of the yield curve bancshares manages this inherent risk strategically based on prescribed guidelines and approved limits interest rate risk can arise from many of bancshares business activities such as lending leasing investing deposit taking derivatives and funding activities we evaluate and monitor interest rate risk primarily through two metrics net interest income sensitivity nii sensitivity measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted nii and economic value of equity eve sensitivity eve sensitivity measures the net impact of these hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments bancshares uses a holistic process to measure and monitor both short term and long term risks which includes but is not limited to gradual and immediate parallel rate shocks changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationship of various yield curves nii sensitivity generally focuses on shorter term earnings risk while eve sensitivity assesses the longerterm risk of the existing balance sheet our exposure to nii sensitivity is guided by the risk appetite framework and statement and a range of risk metrics and bancshares may utilize tools across the balance sheet to adjust its interest rate risk exposures including through business line actions and actions within the investment funding and derivative portfolios the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities generally results in a net assetsensitive position for nii sensitivity whereby our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities our funding sources consist primarily of deposits and we also support our funding needs through wholesale funding sources including unsecured and secured borrowings the svbb acquisition significantly increased our balance sheet and changed our rate sensitivity at the time of the svbb acquisition we assumed billion of deposits entered into a billion fixedrate purchase money note payable to the fdic and acquired billion of loans most of which have variable rates and billion of cash and interestbearing deposits at banks the deposit rates we offer are influenced by market conditions and competitive factors market rates are the key drivers of deposit costs and we continue to optimize deposit costs by improving our deposit mix changes in interest rates expected funding needs as well as actions by competitors can affect our deposit taking activities and deposit pricing we believe our targeted nonmaturity deposit customer retention is strong and we remain focused on optimizing our mix of deposits we regularly assess the effect of deposit rate changes on our balances and seek to achieve optimal alignment between assets and liabilities the following table summarizes the results of 12month nii sensitivity simulations produced by our assetliability management system these simulations assume static balance sheet replacement with like products and implied forward market rates but also incorporate additional assumptions including prepayment estimates pricing estimates deposit behaviors and using internal models the below simulations assume an immediate and bps parallel increase and decrease from the marketbased forward curve for december and table net interest income sensitivity simulation analysis table start estimated decrease increase in nii change in interest rate bps december december december table end nii sensitivity metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by the addition of the acquired loans and assumed deposits as part of the svbb acquisition as well as the purchase money note and the higher cash balance to manage liquidity risk from the acquired portfolios as of december bancshares continues to have an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile and the potential exposure to forecasted earnings was largely driven by the composition of the balance sheet primarily due to floating rate commercial loans and cash as well as estimates of modest future deposit betas approximately of our loans have floating contractual reference rates indexed primarily to the prime lending rate and secured overnight financing rate sofr deposit betas are currently modeled to have a portfolio average of approximately over the twelvemonth forecast horizon deposit beta is the portion of a change in the federal funds rate that is passed on to the deposit rate actual deposit betas may be different than modeled depending on various factors including liquidity requirements deposit mix and competitive pressures impacts to nii sensitivity may change due to actual results differing from modeled expectations as noted above eve sensitivity supplements nii simulations as it estimates risk exposures beyond a twelvemonth horizon eve sensitivity measures the change in the eve driven by changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments in response to a change in interest rates eve sensitivity was calculated by estimating the change in the net present value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items under various rate movements the following table presents the eve profile as of december and table economic value of equity modeling analysis table start estimated decrease increase in eve change in interest rate bps december december december table end the eve metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by the balance sheet changes noted earlier due to the svbb acquisition in addition to the above reported sensitivities a wide variety of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated within our assetliability management system scenarios that impact balance sheet composition or the sensitivity to key assumptions are also evaluated we use results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate and implement asset and liability management strategies in coordination with the asset liability committee to achieve the desired risk profile while managing our objectives for market risk and other strategic objectives specifically we may manage our interest rate risk position through certain pricing strategies and product design for loans and deposits our investment portfolio funding portfolio or by using derivatives to mitigate earnings volatility the above sensitivities provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity however they do not account for potential changes in credit quality size mix or changes in the competition for business in the industries we serve they also do not account for other business developments and other actions accordingly we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations the following table provides

bancshares are in accordance with gaap and are described in note 1significant accounting policies and basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting estimates related to bancshares alll and certain purchase accounting fair value estimates for the svbb acquisition related to loans and core deposit intangibles are considered to be critical accounting estimates because considerable judgment and estimation is applied by management alll the alll represents managements best estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan or lease adjusted for expected contractual payments and the impact of prepayment expectations estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components present as of the evaluation date the alll is calculated based on a variety of considerations including but not limited to actual net loss history of the various loan and lease pools delinquency trends changes in forecasted economic conditions loan growth estimated loan life and changes in portfolio credit quality loans and leases are segregated into pools with similar risk characteristics and each have a model that is utilized to estimate the alll the alll models utilize economic variables including unemployment gdp home price index cre index corporate profits and credit spreads these economic variables are based on macroeconomic scenario forecasts with a forecast horizon that covers the lives of the loan portfolios while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our alll is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control which are inherently difficult to predict the most significant being the macroeconomic scenario forecasts that determine the economic variables utilized in the alll models due to the inherent uncertainty in the macroeconomic forecasts bancshares utilizes baseline upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios and weights the scenarios based on review of variable forecasts for each scenario and comparison to expectations at december alll estimates in these scenarios ranged from approximately billion when weighing the upside scenario to approximately billion when weighting the downside scenario bancshares management determined that an alll of billion was appropriate as of december current economic conditions and forecasts can change which could affect the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses and therefore the appropriateness of the alll it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall alll because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the alll and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others accounting policies related to the alll are discussed in note 1significant accounting policies and basis of presentation for more information regarding the alll refer to the credit risk management alll section of this mda and note 5allowance for loan and lease losses purchase accounting fair value estimates acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition the determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions at the time of the acquisition and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and may require adjustments the fair values for these items are further discussed in note 2business combinations fair values of loans acquired in and core deposit intangibles associated with the svbb acquisition are considered critical accounting estimates and are further discussed below loans fair values for loans acquired in the svbb acquisition were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that forecasts expected credit and prepayment adjusted cash flows which were discounted using marketbased discount rates this approach also considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral fixed or variable interest rate remaining term credit quality ratings or scores and amortization status selected larger impaired loans were specifically reviewed to evaluate fair value loans with similar risk characteristics were pooled together when applying various valuation techniques the discount rates used for loans were based on an evaluation of current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and required rates of return for market participants to purchase similar assets including adjustments for liquidity and credit quality when necessary in our valuation analysis the discount rate had the most significant impact on the valuation an increase of to the discount rates used to derive the fair value of the loans at the time of the acquisition would have reduced the fair value by approximately million whereas a decrease of to the discount rates would have increased the fair value by approximately million core deposit intangibles certain core deposits were acquired as part of the svbb acquisition which provide an additional source of funds for bancshares core deposit intangibles represent the costs saved by bancshares by acquiring the core deposits rather than sourcing the funds elsewhere the core deposit intangibles were recorded at fair value of million at the svbb acquisition date see note 1significant accounting policies and basis of presentation for further accounting policy information note 2business combinations and note 8goodwill and core deposit intangibles core deposit intangibles were valued using the income approach aftertax cost savings method this method estimates the fair value by discounting to present value the favorable funding spread attributable to the core deposit balances over their estimated average remaining life the favorable funding spread is calculated as the difference in the alternative cost of funds and the net deposit cost the discounted cash flow methodology considered discount rate client attrition rate cost of the deposit base reserve requirements net maintenance cost and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources in our valuation analysis the attrition rate had the most significant impact on the valuation an increase of to the attrition rates used to derive the fair value of core deposit intangibles at the svbb acquisition date would have decreased core deposit intangibles by approximately million whereas a decrease to the attrition rates of would have increased core deposit intangibles by approximately million recent accounting pronouncements bancshares adopted the following fasb
