equipment financing and growth in both commercial and consumer mortgage loans total deposits at december were billion an increase of billion from december reflecting the addition of billion from the cit merger total deposits declined during the second and third quarters of reflecting the most rate sensitive customers moving funds in response to increases in the target federal funds rate this decline in total deposits was primarily concentrated in branches acquired in the cit merger and the commercial banking segment deposits increased during the fourth quarter of primarily related to the direct bank and the corporate segment which includes brokered deposits in the fourth quarter of increases in savings and time deposit accounts offset declines in noninterestbearing demand accounts and money market accounts at december bancshares remained wellcapitalized with a total riskbased capital ratio of a tier riskbased capital ratio of a common equity tier ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of recent economic and industry developments throughout the fomc significantly raised its target for the federal funds rate in an effort to combat rising inflation the fomc raised interest rates at its respective meetings during as follows table fomc interest rate increases table start month basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase march x may december x june july september november x table end with the latest increase of basis points at the january meeting the fomc raised their benchmark federal funds rate to a range between and signaled possible further increases in the fomcs effort to control inflation has increased concerns over the possibility of a recession within the next twelve months in addition geopolitical events including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity the timing and impact of inflation continued volatility in the stock market rising interest rates and possible recession will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict results of operations net interest income and net interest margin nii is the difference between interest income on interestearning assets and interest expense on interestbearing liabilities nii is affected by changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the following table presents the average balances yields on interestearning assets rates on interestbearing liabilities and yearoveryear changes in nii due to changes in i volume average balances of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and ii yields or rates the change in nii due to volume is calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the yield or rate from the prior year the change in nii due to yield or rate is calculated as the change in yield or rate multiplied by the average balance from the prior year the change in nii due to ratevolume change ie portfolio mix is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume this component is allocated between the changes in nii due to volume and yield or rate based on the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total tax equivalent net interest income was not materially different

rates paid on interestbearing deposits and a decline in interest income on sbappp loans interest income earned on loans and leases for the year ended december was billion an increase of billion compared to the increase was primarily due to the addition of billion of loans and leases acquired in the cit merger loan growth throughout the year as discussed further in the balance sheet section of this mda and a higher yield reflective of the higher rate environment interest income earned on investment securities for the year ended december was million an increase of million compared to the

interestearning deposits at banks for the year ended december was million an increase of million compared to primarily reflecting higher interest rates interest expense on interestbearing deposits for the year ended december was million an increase of million compared to the increase was primarily due to the additional interestbearing deposits assumed in the cit merger which carried a higher average rate than legacy fcb deposits the rising interest rate environment and the need to offer competitive rates to maintain deposit levels interest expense on borrowings for the year ended december was million an increase of million compared to the increase was primarily due to higher interest rates additional fhlb borrowings and the assumed borrowings in the cit merger during the first quarter of we redeemed approximately billion of the billion debt assumed in the cit merger nim for the year ended december was an increase of bps from primarily due to the increase in yield on interestearning assets partially offset by an increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities average interestearning assets for the year ended december were billion compared to billion in the change was primarily due to the interestearning assets of billion acquired in the cit merger and the loan growth during the year average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december were billion this was an increase from billion in primarily due to the addition of deposits and borrowings from the cit merger in addition we increased fhlb borrowings during to supplement funding due to the decrease in deposits during the second and third quarters with the growth in deposits in the fourth quarter we were able to rebalance our funding mix of deposits and borrowings and reduced our fhlb borrowings the rate paid on average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december was this bps increase was primarily due to the impact of the higher rate environment on both deposits and borrowings

the results by business segment section of this mda for further details other noninterest income other noninterest income for the year ended december was billion compared to million in the million gain on acquisition related to the cit merger was a significant component of the increase as further discussed in note business combinations the remaining increase was primarily due to the additional

ended december to the year ended december reflects increases and decreases among various noninterest income accounts the more significant variances are explained below fee income and other service charges consisting of items such as capital marketrelated fees fees for lines and letters of credit and servicing fees increased by million primarily reflecting the added cit activity wealth management services increased by million primarily due to increases in advisory and transactions fees and assets under management service charges on deposit accounts increased by million while the

reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market andor credit risk we strive to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning deposits at banks interestearning deposits at banks at december totaled billion this was a decrease from billion at december the decline related to loan growth the decline in total deposits and billion used for share repurchases while the cit merger added approximately billion of interestearning deposits at banks as of the merger date that amount was offset by the use of cash for the redemption in february of approximately billion of debt assumed in the cit merger investment securities the primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with bancshares objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into interestearning deposits at banks conversely when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and shortterm borrowings we allow interestearning deposits at banks to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan growth see note significant accounting policies and basis of presentation and note investment securities for additional disclosures regarding investment securities the carrying value of investment securities at december totaled billion the increase from billion at december primarily reflected the cit merger which added billion the remaining activity during included purchases of

securities available for sale had a net pretax unrealized loss of million compared to a net pretax unrealized loss of million as of december the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates credit spreads market volatility and liquidity conditions the fair value of the investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen management evaluated the investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates relative to when

philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities commensurate with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive risk management framework and risk appetite framework and statement senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees our board strives to ensure that risk management is a part of our business culture and that our policies and procedures for identifying assessing monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the boards role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board administers its risk oversight function primarily through its risk committee the risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the full board regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance asset strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework and statement the risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the risk committees oversight responsibilities the risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks compensation risk management and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods bancshares monitors and stress tests its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators refer to the regulatory considerations section of item business included in this annual report on

risks is integrated into normal risk monitoring activities bancshares has been assessing the emerging impacts of the international tensions that could impact the economy and exacerbate headwinds of rising inflation elevated market volatility global supply chain disruptions and recessionary pressures as well as operational risks such as those associated with potential cyberattacks for fcb and third parties upon whom it relies assessments have not identified material impacts to date but those assessments will remain ongoing as the condition continues to exist bancshares is also assessing the potential risk of an economic slowdown or recession that could create increased credit and market risk having downstream impacts on earnings capital andor liquidity economic data has been mixed and markets have experienced elevated levels of volatility in key indicators will continue to be monitored and impacts assessed as part of our ongoing risk management framework credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an appropriate acl that accounts for expected losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolios our acl estimate as of december included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the uncertainties around economic forecasts these loss estimates additionally considered bancshares industry risk historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress as well as recent credit trends which have not seen significant deterioration as of december our acl methodology is discussed further in note significant accounting policies and basis of presentation commercial lending and leasing bancshares employs a dual ratings system where each commercial loan is assigned a probability of default pd and loss given default lgd rating using scorecards developed to rate each type of transaction incorporating assessments of both quantitative and qualitative factors when commercial loans and leases are graded during underwriting or when updated periodically thereafter a model is run to generate a preliminary risk rating these models incorporate both internal and external historical default and loss data to develop loss rates for each risk rating the preliminary risk rating assigned by the model can be adjusted as a result of borrower specific facts and circumstances that in managements judgment warrant a modification of the modeled risk rating to arrive at the final approved risk ratings consumer lending consumer lending begins with an evaluation of a consumer borrowers credit profile against published standards credit decisions are made after analyzing quantitative and qualitative factors including borrowers ability to repay the loan collateral values and considering the transaction from a judgmental perspective consumer products use traditional and measurable standards to document and assess the creditworthiness of a loan applicant credit standards follow industry standard documentation requirements performance is largely evaluated based on an acceptable pay history along with a quarterly assessment which incorporates current market conditions loans may also be monitored during quarterly reviews of the borrowers refreshed credit score when warranted an additional review of the loantovalue of the underlying collateral may be conducted allowance for credit losses the acl at december was million an increase of million compared to million at december the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases at december was compared to at december the increase in the acl is primarily due to the impact of the cit merger including the initial acl for pcd loans and leases the initial pcd acl of million and the day provision for loans and leases of million related to nonpcd loans and leases the increase was also related to loan growth and deterioration in the economic outlook that impacts the macroeconomic variables utilized by our acl models including gross domestic product gdp home price index commercial real estate index corporate profits and credit spreads in contemplation of additional uncertainty primarily based on the elevated levels of inflation and its impact on other macroeconomic variables such as interest rates which could in turn impact home prices commercial real estate values and other variables we do not believe the current baseline scenario fully incorporates the potential downside impacts of future macroeconomic

total table end we have historically carried a concentration of real estate secured loans but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather

impact of the cit merger and respective loans acquired loans and leases to borrowers in medical dental or other healthcare fields were billion as of december which represents of commercial loans and

loans home equity lines of credit or helocs present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate

helocs secured by real estate were billion or of total consumer loans at december compared to billion or at december the cit merger had minimal impact on the outstanding balance as the acquired consumer portfolio was primarily residential mortgages except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions we have not purchased helocs in the secondary market nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas all originated helocs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria the heloc portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period approximately of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in north carolina and south carolina approximately of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining are secured by junior liens we actively monitor the portion of our helocs in the interestonly period and when they will mature when helocs switch from interestonly to fully amortizing including principal and interest some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments we have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments in the normal course of business we will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment counterparty risk we enter into interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts as part of our overall risk management practices and also on behalf of our clients we establish risk metrics and evaluate and manage the counterparty risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the comprehensive risk management framework and risk appetite framework and statement counterparty credit exposure or counterparty risk is a primary risk of derivative instruments relating to the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under the derivative contract we seek to control credit risk of derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals preestablished exposure limits and monitoring procedures which are integrated with our cash and issuer related credit processes the applicable chief credit officer or delegate approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis of each counterparty derivative agreements for bancshares risk management purposes and for the hedging of client transactions are executed with major financial institutions and are settled through the major clearing exchanges which are rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies credit exposure is mitigated via the exchange of collateral between the counterparties covering marktomarket valuations client related derivative transactions which are primarily related to lending activities are incorporated into our loan underwriting and reporting processes asset risk asset risk is a form of price risk and is a primary risk of our leasing businesses related to the risk to earning of capital arising from changes in the value of owned leasing equipment reflecting the addition of operating lease equipment and additional assetbased lending from the cit merger we are subject to increased asset risk asset risk in our leasing business is evaluated and managed in the divisions and overseen by risk management processes in our assetbased lending business we also use residual value guarantees to mitigate or partially mitigate exposure to end of lease residual value exposure on certain of our finance leases our business process consists of setting residual values at transaction inception systematic periodic residual value reviews and monitoring levels of residual realizations residual realizations by business and product are reviewed as part of the quarterly financial and asset quality review reviews for impairment are performed at least annually in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices asset risk is monitored through reviews of the equipment markets including utilization rates and traffic flows the evaluation of supply and demand dynamics the impact of new technologies and changes in regulatory requirements on different types of equipment at a high level demand for equipment is correlated with gdp growth trends for the markets the equipment serves as well as the more immediate conditions of those markets cyclicality in the economy and shifts in trade flows due to specific events represent risks to the earnings that can be realized by these businesses for instance in the rail business bancshares seeks to mitigate these risks by maintaining a relatively young fleet of assets which can bolster attractive lease and utilization rates market risk interest rate risk management bancshares is exposed to the risk that changes in market conditions may affect interest rates and negatively impact earnings the risk arises from the nature of bancshares business activities the composition of bancshares balance sheet and changes in the level or shape of the yield curve bancshares manages this inherent risk strategically based on prescribed guidelines and approved limits interest rate risk can arise from many of the bancshares business activities such as lending leasing investing deposit taking derivatives and funding activities we evaluate and monitor interest rate risk primarily through two metrics net interest income sensitivity nii sensitivity measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted nii and economic value of equity sensitivity eve sensitivity measures the net impact of these hypothetical changes on the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments bancshares uses a holistic process to measure and monitor both short term and long term risks which includes but is not limited to gradual and immediate parallel rate shocks changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationship of various yield curves nii sensitivity generally focuses on shorter term earnings risk while eve sensitivity assesses the longerterm risk of the existing balance sheet our exposure to nii sensitivity is guided by the risk appetite framework and statement and a range of risk metrics and bancshares may utilize tools across the balance sheet to adjust its interest rate risk exposures including through business line actions and actions within the investment funding and derivative portfolios the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities generally results in a net assetsensitive position for nii sensitivity whereby our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities which is generally concentrated at the short end of the yield curve our funding sources consist primarily of deposits and we also support our funding needs through wholesale funding sources including unsecured and secured borrowings the deposit rates we offer are influenced by market conditions and competitive factors market rates are the key drivers of deposit costs and we continue to optimize deposit costs by improving our deposit mix changes in interest rates expected funding needs as well as actions by competitors can affect our deposit taking activities and deposit pricing we believe our targeted nonmaturity deposit customer retention is strong and we remain focused on optimizing our mix of deposits we regularly assess the effect of deposit rate changes on our balances and seek to achieve optimal alignment between assets and liabilities the following table below summarizes the results of 12month nii sensitivity simulations produced by our assetliability management system these simulations assume static balance sheet replacement with like products and implied forward market rates but also incorporates additional assumptions such as but not limited to prepayment estimates pricing estimates and deposit behaviors the below simulations assume an immediate and bps parallel increase and and bps decrease from the marketbased forward curve for december and table net interest income sensitivity simulation analysis table start estimated decrease increase in nii change in interest rate bps december december table end nii sensitivity metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by a reduction in cash as well as liability management actions which included borrowing fhlb advances to support loan growth and to offset deposit runoff bancshares continues to have an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile and the potential exposure to forecasted earnings is largely due to the composition of the balance sheet primarily due to floating rate commercial loans and cash as well as estimates of modest cumulative future deposit betas approximately of our loans have floating contractual reference rates indexed primarily to 1month libor 3month libor prime and sofr deposit betas for the combined company are modeled to have a portfolio average of approximately over the forecast horizon impacts to nii sensitivity may change due to actual results differing from modeled expectations as noted above eve sensitivity supplements nii simulations as it estimates risk exposures beyond a twelvemonth horizon eve sensitivity measures the change in value of the economic value of equity reflecting changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments in response to a change in interest rates eve sensitivity is calculated by estimating the change in the net present value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items under various rate movements the following table presents the eve profile as of december and table economic value of equity modeling analysis table start estimated decrease increase in eve change in interest rate bps december december table end the economic value of equity metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by balance sheet composition changes as well as increasing market interest rates in addition to the above reported sensitivities a wide variety of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated within our assetliability management system scenarios that impact management volumes specific risk events or the sensitivity to key assumptions are also evaluated we use results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate and implement asset and liability management strategies in coordination with the asset liability committee to achieve the desired risk profile while managing our objectives for market risk and other strategic objectives specifically we may manage our interest rate risk position through certain pricing strategies and product design for loans and deposits our investment portfolio funding portfolio or by using off balance sheet derivatives to mitigate earnings volatility the above sensitivities provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity however they do not account for potential changes in credit quality size mix or changes in the competition for business in the industries we serve they also do not account for other business developments and other actions accordingly we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations further the range of such simulations is not intended to represent our current view of the expected range of future interest

commonly used tenors of us dollar libor will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after june the us federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the us dollar libor as a reference rate in new contracts by december at the latest accordingly prior to the cit merger fcb and cit had ceased originating new products using libor by the end of in april the frb of new york commenced publication of sofr which has been recommended as an alternative to us dollar libor by the alternative reference rates committee a group of market and official sector participants on march the us congress adopted as part of the consolidated appropriation act of the adjustable interest libor act which provides certain statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by us law that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate on july the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposed regulation to implement the libor act as required by its terms the libor act requires implementing regulations be in place within days of its enactment the final rule was approved by the frb on december and will become effective days after it is published in the federal register bancshares anticipates using boardselected benchmark replacements to take advantage of the safe harbors that are afforded in the rule bancshares holds instruments such as loans investments derivative products and other financial instruments that use libor as a benchmark rate however bancshares libor exposure is primarily to tenures other than one week and twomonth usd libor libor is a benchmark interest rate for most of our floating rate loans and our series b preferred stock as well as certain liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments and have a wellestablished transition program in place to manage the implementation of alternative reference rates as the market transitions away from libor coordination is being handled by a crossfunctional project team governed by executive sponsors its mission is to work with our businesses to ensure a smooth transition for bancshares and its customers to an appropriate libor alternative certain financial markets and products have already migrated to alternatives the project team ensures that bancshares is ready to move quickly and efficiently as consensus around libor alternatives emerge bancshares has processes in place to complete its review of the population of legal contracts impacted by the libor transition and updates to our operational systems and processes are substantially in place bancshares is utilizing sofr as our preferred replacement index for libor as loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of bancshares variablerate loans are expected to reference sofr in response to the discontinuation of libor however we are positioned to accommodate other alternative reference rates eg credit sensitive rates in

bancshares and fcb primarily consists of qualifying acl and qualifying subordinated debt critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of bancshares are in accordance with gaap and are described in note significant accounting policies and basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting estimates related to bancshares acl and certain purchase accounting fair value estimates for the cit merger related to loans core deposit intangibles and operating lease equipment in the rail segment rail assets are considered to be critical accounting estimates because considerable judgment and estimation is applied by management acl the acl represents managements best estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan or lease adjusted for expected contractual payments and the impact of prepayment expectations estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components present as of the evaluation date the acl is calculated based on a variety of considerations including but not limited to actual net loss history of the various loan and lease pools delinquency trends changes in forecasted economic conditions loan growth estimated loan life and changes in portfolio credit quality loans and leases are segregated into pools with similar risk characteristics and each have a model that is utilized to estimate the acl the acl models utilize economic variables including unemployment gdp home price index commercial real estate index corporate profits and credit spreads these economic variables are based on macroeconomic scenario forecasts with a forecast horizon that covers the lives of the loan portfolios while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our acl is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control which are inherently difficult to predict the most significant being the macroeconomic scenario forecasts that determine the economic variables utilized in the acl models due to the inherent uncertainty in the macroeconomic forecasts bancshares utilizes baseline upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios and weights the scenarios based on review of variable forecasts for each scenario and comparison to expectations at december acl estimates in these scenarios ranged from approximately million when weighting the upside scenario to approximately billion when weighting the downside scenario bancshares management determined that an acl of million was appropriate as of december current economic conditions and forecasts can change which could affect the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses and therefore the appropriateness of the acl it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall acl because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others accounting policies related to the acl are discussed in note significant accounting policies and basis of presentation for more information regarding the acl refer to the credit risk management acl section of this mda and note allowance for credit losses purchase accounting fair value estimates acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition the determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions at the time of the merger and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and may require adjustments the fair values for these items are further discussed in note business combinations fair values of acquired loans and leases core deposit intangibles recorded and rail assets associated with the cit merger are considered critical accounting estimates and discussed further below loans and leases fair values for loans acquired in the cit merger were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that forecasts expected credit and prepayment adjusted cash flows which were discounted using marketbased discount rates this approach also considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral fixed or variable interest rate remaining term credit quality ratings or scores and amortization status selected larger impaired loans were specifically reviewed to evaluate fair value loans with similar risk characteristics were pooled together when applying various valuation techniques the discount rates used for loans were based on an evaluation of current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and required rates of return for market participants to purchase similar assets including adjustments for liquidity and credit quality when necessary in our valuation analysis the discount rate had the most significant impact on the valuation an increase of to the discount rates used to derive the fair value of the loans at the time of the merger would have reduced the approximate fair value by million whereas a decrease of to the discount rates would have increased the fair value by approximately million core deposit intangibles certain core deposits were acquired as part of the cit merger which provide an additional source of funds for bancshares core deposit intangibles represent the costs saved by bancshares by acquiring the core deposits rather than sourcing the funds elsewhere the core deposit intangibles were recorded at fair value of million see note significant accounting policies and basis of presentation for further accounting policy information and note goodwill and other intangibles core deposit intangibles were valued using the income approach aftertax cost savings method this method estimates the fair value by discounting to present value the favorable funding spread attributable to the core deposit balances over their estimated average remaining life the favorable funding spread is calculated as the difference in the alternative cost of funds and the net deposit cost the discounted cash flow methodology considered discount rate client attrition rates cost of the deposit base reserve requirements net maintenance cost and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources in our valuation analysis the discount rate had the most significant impact on the valuation an increase of to the discount rates used to derive the core deposit intangibles at the merger date would have decreased core deposit intangibles by approximately million whereas a decrease to the discount rates of would have increased core deposit intangibles by approximately million rail assets our rail assets consist of railcars and locomotives fair values for acquired rail assets were based primarily on a cost approach under an inuse premise the sales approach was used to value rail assets when market information was available a discount was recorded for rail assets to reduce the carrying value to fair value rail assets are discussed further in the rail discussion in the section entitled results by business segment of this mda recent accounting pronouncements the following asus issued by the fasb were adopted by bancshares as of january there

method to include nonprepayable financial assets provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method in addition as of the adoption date the update permits reclassification of debt securities from the heldtomaturity category to the availableforsale category if the entity intends to include those securities in a portfolio designated in a portfolio layer method hedge bancshares adopted asu as of january adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on bancshares consolidated financial statements and disclosures as bancshares did not have any hedged portfolios asu troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures issued march for creditors that have adopted cecl the amendments in this asu i eliminate the previous recognition and measurement guidance for tdrs ii require new disclosures for loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the modification disclosures and iii

weighted average interest rate iii the performance of the loan in the months following the modification and iv qualitative information discussing how the modifications factored into the determination of the acl bancshares adopted asu as of january and elected to apply the modified retrospective transition method for acl recognition and measurement as a result of adopting this asu bancshares does not expect a material change to its acl related to loans previously modified as a tdr and therefore does not expect a material cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january the modification disclosures and gross chargeoff vintage disclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning in bancshares quarterly report on form 10q as of and for the three months ending march table end the following asus related to reference rate reform can be applied through december table start standard summary of guidance effect on bancshares financial statements asu reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting issued march asu reference rate reform topic scope issued january asu reference rate reform topic deferral of the sunset date of topic issued december the amendments in these updates apply only to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform allows entities to prospectively apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and removes the requirements to remeasure contract modifications or dedesignate hedging relationships in addition potential sources of ineffectiveness as a result of reference rate reform may be disregarded when performing certain effectiveness assessments the main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform asu refines the scope of asc and clarifies which optional expedients may be applied to derivative instruments that do not reference libor or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued but that are being modified in connection with the marketwide transition to new reference rates asu extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under asu from december to december bancshares continues to assess the impact of the optional expedients available through december for eligible contract modifications and hedge relationships however the reference rate reform optional expedients have not yet been applied to any contracts and adoption of this guidance has not had and is expected to continue to not have a material impact on the financial statements table end nongaap financial measurements bancshares provides certain nongaap information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate its operations a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys historical or future financial performance or financial position that may either exclude or include amounts or is adjusted in some way to the effect of including or excluding amounts as compared to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap financial statements bancshares believes that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial information can provide transparency about or an alternate means of assessing its operating results and financial position to its investors analysts and management these nongaap measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or a substitute for gaap measures presented in bancshares consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in addition our nongaap measures may be different from or inconsistent with nongaap financial measures used by other institutions whenever we refer to a nongaap financial measure we will generally define and present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap along with a reconciliation between the us gaap financial measure and

such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification substandard a substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged if any assets classified as substandard generally have a welldefined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt these assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected doubtful an asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or
