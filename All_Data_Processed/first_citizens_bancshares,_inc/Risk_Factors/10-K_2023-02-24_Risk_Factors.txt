item risk factors risk factor summary we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we encounter risks as part of the normal course of our business and our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities we categorize risks into the following areas and the principal risks and uncertainties that management believes make an investment in us speculative or risky are summarized within their respective areas strategic risks the risks to our earnings or capital arising from our business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions we may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed pending or any potential future acquisitions our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the cit merger operational risks the risks of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes people and systems or from external events we face significant operational risks in our businesses and may fail to maintain appropriate operational infrastructure and oversight a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology outage of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential customer or employee data or proprietary information and increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure this could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause us legal or reputational harm credit risks the risks that a borrower obligor or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation or that our risk management processes will fail or be insufficient if we fail to effectively manage credit risk our business and financial condition will suffer our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolios market risks the risks to our financial condition resulting from adverse movements in domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions as well as economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending international trade policy and fiscal and monetary policy unfavorable economic or political conditions as considered through a range of metrics have and could continue to adversely affect our business failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us liquidity risks the risks that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to i liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or ii unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions or that we will not meet the liquidity management requirements applicable to us as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods if our current level of balance sheet liquidity were to experience pressure it could affect our ability to pay deposits and fund our operations we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods including reporting liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer as well as resolution planning at the bank level and failure to meet these requirements could result in regulatory and compliance risks and possible restrictions on our activities capital adequacy risks the risks that our capital levels become inadequate to preserve our safety and soundness support our ongoing business operations and strategies and provide us with support against unexpected or sudden changes in the businesseconomic environment or that we will not meet the capital adequacy requirements applicable to us as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods our ability to grow is contingent upon access to capital which may not be readily available to us we and fcb are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition and ability to make capital distributions would be adversely affected compliance risks the risks of loss or reputational harm to us resulting from regulatory sanctions fines penalties or losses due to our failure to comply with laws rules regulations or other supervisory requirements applicable to us we operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern our operations taxes corporate governance executive compensation and financial accounting and reporting including changes in them or our failure to comply with them may adversely affect us information security and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus asset risks the risks that the value of our longlived assets will be lower than expected resulting in reduced income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment that we lease to our customers financial reporting risks the risks that our financial information is reported incorrectly or incompletely including through the improper application of accounting standards or other errors or omissions accounting standards may change and increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our results our accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and such estimates may be materially different from actual results the risks and uncertainties that management believes are material to an investment in us are described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to management or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our financial condition the results of our operations or our business if such risks and uncertainties were to materialize or the likelihoods of the risks were to increase we could be adversely affected and the market price of our securities could significantly decline strategic risks we may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed pending or any potential future acquisitions we plan to continue to grow our business organically however we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategies and may enhance our profitability for example on january we consummated the acquisition of cit which added billion in total assets billion in deposits and billion in loans we must generally satisfy a number of material conditions prior to consummating any acquisition including in many cases federal and state regulatory approval among other things our regulators will consider our capital liquidity profitability regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill when considering acquisition and expansion proposals we may fail to complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all or the approval for such opportunity could include conditions imposing additional costs or limitations that reduce the anticipated related benefits on july president biden issued the executive order which encouraged federal banking agencies to review the framework for evaluating bank mergers and acquisitions under the bhc act and the bank merger act the executive order has received significant public support from members of congress as well as from members of the board of the fdic and federal reserve and the acting comptroller of the currency the director of the cfpb has publicly sought a greater role for the cfpb in the evaluation of bank merger proposals any enhanced regulatory scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions and revision of the regulatory framework for approval of bank mergers could adversely affect the marketplace for bank merger transactions and could result in potential future acquisitions by us being delayed impeded or restricted in certain respects and result in new rules that possibly limit the size of financial institutions that we may be able to acquire in the future or alter the terms for such transactions we may be unsuccessful in identifying consummating or integrating any potential acquisitions acquisitions of financial institutions assets of financial institutions or other operating entities involve operational risks and uncertainties acquired companies or assets may have unknown or contingent liabilities exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require write downs or writeoffs additional regulatory requirements or difficulty retaining key employees and customers due to these and other issues relating to acquisitions we may not be able to realize projected cost savings synergies or other benefits associated with any such acquisition failure to efficiently integrate any acquired entities or assets into our existing operations could significantly increase our operating costs and consequently have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the cit merger following the cit merger the size and geographic and operational scope of our business has increased significantly the cit merger more than doubled our asset size increased the breadth and complexity of our business with the addition of new business lines in which we have not previously engaged and expanded our geographic scope to new geographic areas our future success depends in part upon the ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new and expanded operations and associated increased costs and complexity we may be unsuccessful in this regard or fail to realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the cit merger we encounter significant competition that may reduce our market share and profitability we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with other banks and specialized financial services providers in our market areas our primary competitors include local regional and national banks credit unions commercial finance companies leasing companies various wealth management providers independent and captive insurance agencies mortgage companies and other nonbank providers of financial services some of our larger competitors including certain banks with a significant presence in our market areas have the capacity to offer products and services we do not offer some of our nonbank competitors operate in less stringent regulatory environments and certain competitors are not subject to federal or state income taxes the fierce competitive pressures that we face adversely affect pricing for many of our products and services additionally technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods without involving banks for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts mutual funds or virtual accounts consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks transactions utilizing digital assets including cryptocurrencies stablecoins and other similar assets have increased substantially certain characteristics of digital asset transactions such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions and the anonymous nature of the transactions are appealing to certain consumers accordingly digital asset service providerswhich at present are not subject to as extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutionshave become active competitors for our customers banking business and may have greater flexibility in competing for business the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the cit merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter difficulties in completing the integration of the acquired operations and may incur expenses in excess of those forecasted in connection with the completion the success of the cit merger including anticipated benefits and cost savings depends in substantial part on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the acquired operations in a manner that results in various benefits such as anticipated synergies and cost savings and that does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers although our merger integration is substantially complete the process of integrating operations resulted in a loss of key personnel and we could still discover inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies which could adversely affect us while we have attempted to accurately forecast a certain level of expense and expected cost savings in connection with the integration there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount and the timing of the integration expense and projected cost savings in addition the diversion of managements attention and any unexpected delays or difficulties encountered in completing the integration of the acquired operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in their best interests we are a banking holding company incorporated in the state of delaware certain antitakeover provisions under delaware law and certain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws our bylaws could delay or prevent the removal of our directors and other management the provisions could also delay or make more difficult a tender offer merger or proxy contest a stockholder might consider to be in their best interests for example our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow the board to issue and set the terms of preferred shares without further stockholder approval limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board and proposals of other business to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders and authorize the issuance of two classes of common stock one of which class b common stock par value per share class b common stock is entitled to cast votes per share as of december approximately of the outstanding shares of class b common stock were owned and entitled to be voted by our directors and executive officers and certain of their affiliates these provisions as well as provisions of the bhc act and other relevant statutes and regulations that require advance notice and applications for regulatory approval of changes in control of banks and bank holding companies may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price adversely affecting the price that could be received by our stockholders for our common stock additionally the fact that the holding family and entities related to various family members hold or control shares representing approximately and in the past have held or controlled shares representing more than of the voting power of our common stock may discourage potential takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over market price our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders this could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees or agents our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers other employees or stockholder to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware or as to which the general corporation law of the state of delaware confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery of the state of delaware or iv any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine these choice of forum provisions do not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the securities act of as amended or the securities exchange act of as amended accordingly our choice of forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations these choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees or agents which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees or agents if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if we are successful in defending against these claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees we rely on dividends from fcb for paying dividends on our common and preferred stock and servicing our debt obligations and fcbs ability to pay us dividends is restricted as a fhc we are a separate legal entity from fcb we derive most of our revenue and cash flow from dividends paid by fcb these dividends are the primary source from which we pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt obligations state and federal laws impose restrictions on the dividends that fcb may pay to us in the event fcb is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time we may not be able to service our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock and the inability to receive dividends from fcb could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our financial performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services which may be adversely impacted by weakened consumer or business confidence and by any inability on our part to predict and satisfy customers needs and demands our financial performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand a fragile weakening or changing economy or ambiguity surrounding the economic future may lessen the demand for our products and services our performance may also be negatively impacted if we fail to attract and retain customers because we are not able to successfully anticipate develop and market products and services that satisfy market demands such events could impact our performance through fewer loans reduced fee income and fewer deposits each of which could result in reduced net income new technologies and our ability to efficiently and effectively implement market and deliver new products and services to our customers present competitive risks the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introduction of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs the rapid growth of new digital technologies related to the digitization of banking services and capabilities including through internet services smart phones and other mobile devices requires us to continuously evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive these trends were accelerated by the covid19 pandemic increasing demand for mobile banking solutions our success depends in part on our ability to adapt and deliver our products and services in a manner responsive to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies by banks and nonbank service providers may create risks if our products and services are no longer competitive with thencurrent standards and could negatively affect our ability to attract or maintain a loyal customer base we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services that allow us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers these risks may affect our ability to grow and could reduce our revenue streams from certain products and services while increasing expenses associated with developing more competitive solutions which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition operational risks we face significant operational risks in our businesses and may fail to maintain appropriate operational infrastructure and oversight safely conducting and growing our business requires that we create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational control infrastructure operational risk can arise in numerous ways including but not limited to employee fraud customer fraud and control lapses in bank operations and information technology our dependence on our employees and internal and third party automated systems and vendors to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical failures or systemtampering will result in losses that are difficult to detect our internal controls that are intended to safeguard and maintain our operational and organizational infrastructure and information have inherent limitations and may not be successful we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control in addition our railcars are used to transport a variety of products including but not limited to cement energy products chemicals and coal an accidental derailment of these railcars could result in personal injury and property damage which could be significant as well as potential environmental remediation and restoration obligations and penalties failure to maintain appropriate operational infrastructure and oversight or to safely operate our business can lead to loss of service to customers reputational harm legal actions and noncompliance with various laws and regulations all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology outage of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential customer or employee data or proprietary information and increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure this could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause us legal or reputational harm our businesses are highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely our businesses rely on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks which may provide a point of entry for adverse effects on our own network environment we our customers regulators and other third parties have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks these cyberattacks include computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware phishing attacks denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damages to systems or other material disruption to our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we have been and will likely continue to be required to expend significant resources to continuously enhance our protective measures and may be required to expend significant resources to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches additionally a security breach may be difficult to detect even after it occurs which may compound the issues related to such breach continued geographical turmoil including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine has heightened the risk of cyberattack and has created new risk for cybersecurity and similar concerns for example the united states government has warned that sanctions imposed against russia by the united states in response to its conflict with ukraine could motivate russia to engage in malicious cyber activities against the united states if such cyberattacks occurred it could result in severe costs and disruptions to governmental entities and companies and their operations the impact of the conflict and retaliatory measures is continually evolving and cannot be predicted with certainty cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties these risks are expected to continue in the future as that proliferation intensifies for example we will likely see an increase in cybersecurity risks in the future as we continue to augment our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition financially motivated attacks remain a challenge from a cybercrime perspective due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise additionally the increase of supply chain attacks including third parties with access to our data or those providing critical services remain an emerging operational issue which could adversely affect our business customers reputation and operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities although to date we are not aware of any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties we may suffer such losses or other consequences in the future we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to customers and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities including financial counterparties financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses vendors regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service our customers manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business and may encourage further cyberattacks a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities disruption to our operations and business misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and that of our customers or damage to our customers and third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable data privacy and protection laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition the ongoing covid19 pandemic including its variant strains may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the spread of covid19 created a global healthcrisis that caused significant economic disruption and continues to cause illness quarantines reduced attendance at events and reduced travel reduced commercial and financial activity and overall economic and financial market instability while the level of disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic has generally lessened in there is no assurance that the pandemic will not worsen again including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus continuation of the covid19 pandemic or a similar crisis could negatively impact our capital liquidity and other financial positions and our business results of operations and prospects economic factors stemming from the lasting effects of the pandemic including inflation risks oil price volatility and changes in interest rates have and may continue to destabilize financial markets and negatively impact our customers business activities and operations making it difficult for them to satisfy existing debt obligations moreover as economic conditions relating to the pandemic have improved and evolved the federal reserve has shifted its focus to limiting the inflationary and other potentially adverse effects of the extensive pandemicrelated government stimulus which signals the potential for a continued period of economic uncertainty the duration and severity of the pandemic continues to be impossible to predict as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence the full extent of the impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including the duration and spread of any further outbreak its severity vaccine effectiveness and acceptance governmental actions to contain the virus including its variants and the longterm economic impact both globally as well as in our banking markets which includes the potential for further recession the effects of the covid19 pandemic heightened specific risk factors and could still impact substantially all risk factors described herein we are subject to litigation and other legal liability risks and our expenses related to such risks may adversely affect our results we are subject to litigation risks in the ordinary course of our business claims and legal actions including supervisory actions by our regulators that have been or may be initiated against us including against entities that we acquire from time to time could involve large monetary sums and significant defense costs during the last credit crisis we saw the number of cases and our expenses related to those cases increase and expect to see the same in future credit crises the outcomes of such cases are always uncertain until finally adjudicated or resolved in the course of our business we may foreclose on and take title to real estate that contains or was used in the manufacture or processing of hazardous materials or that is subject to other environmental risks in addition we may lease equipment to our customers that is used to mine develop and process hazardous materials and our railcars may be used to transport hazardous materials as a result we could be subject to environmental liabilities or claims for negligence property damage or personal injury with respect to these properties or equipment we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage personal injury investigation and cleanup costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination accidents or other hazardous risks or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site or equipment involved in a hazardous incident we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination property damage personal injury or other hazardous risks emanating from the property or related to the equipment we establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and our liability can be reasonably estimated we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve in addition the actual amount paid in resolution of a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for the matter the ultimate resolution of a legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and any relief granted could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition substantial legal claims or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects we may be exposed to substantial uninsured legal liabilities and regulatory actions which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for additional information refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies in this annual report on s including certain climaterelated metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data information about climaterelated targets and goals transition plans if any and extensive attestation requirements further we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the publics view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to esg matters asset risks we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment that we lease to our customers our loans and leases include a significant portion of leased equipment including but not limited to railcars and locomotives technology and office equipment and medical equipment the realization of equipment values residual values during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in the profitability of our leasing business at the inception of each lease we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the end of the lease term or end of the equipments estimated useful life if the market value of leased equipment decreases at a rate greater than we projected whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence unusual wear and tear on the equipment excessive use of the equipment recession or other adverse economic conditions impacting supply and demand it could adversely affect the current values or the residual values of such equipment financial reporting risks accounting standards may change and increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our results the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec periodically modify the standards governing the preparation of our financial statements the nature of these changes is not predictable and has impacted and could further impact how we record transactions in our financial statements which has led to and could lead to material changes in assets liabilities stockholders equity revenues expenses and net income implementation of new accounting rules or standards could additionally require us to implement technology changes which could impact ongoing earnings our accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and such estimates may be materially different from actual results accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management to make difficult subjective or complex conclusions about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters we may be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements refer to critical accounting estimates included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k our business is highly quantitative and requires widespread use of financial models for daytoday operations these models may produce inaccurate predictions that significantly vary from actual results and we may rely on these inaccurate predictions in making decisions that ultimately adversely affect our business we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values such models may be used in many processes including but not limited to the pricing of various products and services classifications of loans setting interest rates on loans and deposits quantifying interest rate and other market risks forecasting losses measuring capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels models may also be used to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items inaccurate or erroneous models present the risk that business decisions relying on the models will prove inefficient ineffective or harmful to us additionally information we provide to our investors and regulators may be negatively impacted by inaccurately designed or implemented models for further information on risk monitoring refer to the risk management section included in item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this annual report on form 10k we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting which could hinder our ability to prevent fraud and provide reliable financial reports to key stakeholders we must have effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to provide reliable financial reports to effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company if we are unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our reputation and operating results will be harmed and we may violate regulatory requirements or otherwise become subject to legal liability we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies requiring remediation which would require additional expense and diversion of management attention among other consequences a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis any failure to maintain effective internal controls or to implement any necessary improvement of our internal controls in a timely manner could among other things result in losses from fraud or error harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market value of our common stock
