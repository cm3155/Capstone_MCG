item risk factors we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities we categorize risk into the following areas table start operational risk the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes people and systems or from external events table endtable start credit risk the risk a borrower will fail to perform on an obligation table end table start market risk the risk to bancshares financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including but not limited to interest rates foreign exchange rates or equity prices table endtable start liquidity risk the risk that bancshares will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to i liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding referred to as funding liquidity risk or ii unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions market liquidity risk table endtable start capital adequacy risk the risk that capital levels are inadequate to preserve the safety and soundness of bancshares support ongoing business operations and strategies and provide support against unexpected or sudden changes in the businesseconomic environment table endtable start compliance risk the risk of loss or reputational harm resulting from regulatory sanctions fines penalties or losses due to the failure to comply with laws rules regulations or other supervisory requirements applicable to a financial institution table endtable start strategic risk the risk to earnings or capital arising from business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions table endtable start financial reporting risk the risk that financial information is reported incorrectly including incorrect or incomplete financial information errors and omissions or improper application of accounting standards table end the risks and uncertainties management believes are material are described below the risks listed are not the only risks bancshares faces additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our financial condition andor the results of our operations or our business if such risks and uncertainties were to materialize or the likelihoods of the risks were to increase the market price of our common stock could significantly decline operational risks we face significant operational risks in our businesses safely conducting and growing our business requires that we create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational control infrastructure operational risk can arise in numerous ways including employee fraud customer fraud and control lapses in bank operations and information technology our dependence on our employees and internal and third party automated systems to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical failures or systemtampering will result in losses that are difficult to detect we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control failure to maintain appropriate operational infrastructure and oversight can lead to loss of service to customers legal actions and noncompliance with various laws and regulations we have implemented internal controls that are designed to safeguard and maintain our operational and organizational infrastructure and information however all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation a cyber attack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure and adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm our businesses are highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely our businesses rely on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our customers regulators and other third parties have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks these cyber attacks include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damages to systems or other material disruption to our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise additionally the existence of cyber attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data such as vendors may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future as a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities including financial counterparties financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses vendors regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any thirdparty technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities disruption to our operations and business misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information andor that of our customers or damage to our customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition we are exposed to losses related to fraud as technology continues to evolve criminals are using increasingly more sophisticated techniques to commit and hide fraudulent activity fraudulent activity can come in many forms including debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud wire fraud electronic scanning devices attached to atm machines social engineering digital fraud and phishing attacks to obtain personal information and fraudulent impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials to counter the increased sophistication of these fraudulent activities we have increased our investment in systems technologies and controls to detect and prevent such fraud combating fraudulent activities as they evolve will result in continued ongoing investments in the future we depend on key personnel for our success our success depends to a great extent on our ability to attract and retain key personnel we have an experienced management team the board believes is capable of managing and growing our business losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we have developed an executive officer succession plan but we cannot be certain of its transition or implementation success there also can be no assurance we will be successful in retaining our current executive officers or other key personnel or hiring additional key personnel to assist in executing our growth expansion and acquisition strategies we are subject to litigation risks and our expenses related to litigation may adversely affect our results we are subject to litigation risks in the ordinary course of our business claims and legal actions including supervisory actions by our regulators that may be initiated against us from time to time could involve large monetary sums and significant defense costs during the last credit crisis we saw the number of cases and our expenses related to those cases increase the outcomes of such cases are always uncertain until finally adjudicated or resolved we establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and our liability can be reasonably estimated we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve in addition the actual amount paid in resolution of a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for the matter the ultimate resolution of a legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and any relief granted could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition substantial legal claims or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects we may be exposed to substantial uninsured legal liabilities andor regulatory actions which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for additional information see the notes to the consolidated financial statements note t commitments and contingencies in this form 10k our business and financial performance could be impacted by natural disasters acts of war or terrorist activities natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and explosions acts of war and terrorist activities could hurt our performance i directly through damage to our facilities or other impacts to our ability to conduct business in the ordinary course and ii indirectly through such damage or impacts to our customers suppliers or other counterparties in particular a significant amount of our business is concentrated in north carolina and south carolina including coastal areas where our retail and commercial customers have been and in the future could be impacted by hurricanes we could also suffer adverse results to the extent that disasters wars or terrorist activities affect the broader markets or economy our ability to minimize the consequences of such events is in significant measure reliant on the quality of our disaster recovery planning and our ability if any to forecast the events we rely on third parties third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure including certain data processing and information services their services could be difficult to quickly replace in the event of failure or other interruption in service failures of certain vendors to provide services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers external vendors also present information security risks we monitor significant vendor risks including the financial stability of critical vendors the failure of a critical external vendor could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant expense the quality of our data could deteriorate and cause financial or reputational harm to the bank while we have a data governance program it is reliant on the execution of procedures process controls and system functionality and there is no guarantee errors will not occur incomplete inconsistent or inaccurate data could lead to noncompliance with regulatory statutes and result in fines additionally customer impact could result in reputational harm and customer attrition inaccurate or incomplete data presents the risk business decisions relying on such data will prove inefficient or ineffective additionally information we provide to our investors and regulators may be negatively impacted by inaccurate or incomplete data malicious action by an employee could result in harm to our customers or the bank several highprofile cases of misconduct have occurred at other financial institutions such an event may lead to large regulatory fines as well as an erosion in customer confidence which could impact our financial position bancshares employees are subject to a code of ethics which requires annual review we also have policies governing our compensation conduct and sales practices designed to deter and respond to potential employee misconduct credit risks if we fail to effectively manage credit risk our business and financial condition will suffer we must effectively manage credit risk there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks of repayment risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral there is no assurance that our loan approval procedures and our credit risk monitoring are or will be adequate to or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending our credit administration personnel policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio we maintain an allowance for loan losses that is designed to cover losses on loans that borrowers may not repay in their entirety we believe that we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date and in compliance with applicable accounting and regulatory guidance however the allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results accounting measurements related to asset impairment and the allowance require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and revisions driven by new information and changing circumstances the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to conduct their businesses successfully through changing economic environments competitive challenges and other factors complicate our estimates of the risk andor amount of loss on any loan due to the degree of uncertainty and the susceptibility to change the actual losses may vary from current estimates we also expect fluctuations in the allowance due to economic changes nationally as well as locally within the states in which we conduct business as an integral part of their examination process our banking regulators periodically review the allowance and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense or to decrease the allowance by recognizing loan chargeoffs net of recoveries any such required additional loan loss provisions or chargeoffs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the first quarter of we adopted a change to the methodology for the recognition and measurement of credit losses to comply with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl cecl introduces a new credit loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses replacing multiple existing impairment methods which generally require a loss to be incurred before it is recognized the amendments in this asu require loss estimates be determined over the lifetime of the asset and broaden the information an entity must consider in developing its expected credit losses as a result this will change the manner by which we calculate our allowance for credit losses and may introduce increased volatility to the balance of our reserves and related provision expense our concentration of loans to borrowers within the medical and dental industries could impair our earnings if those industries experience economic difficulties statutory or regulatory changes or economic conditions in the market generally could negatively impact borrowers businesses and their ability to repay their loans with us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additionally smaller practices such as those in the dental industry generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and generally have a heightened vulnerability to negative economic conditions consequently we could be required to increase our allowance for loan losses through additional provisions on our income statement which would reduce reported net income see note d loans and leases in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion economic conditions in real estate markets and our reliance on junior liens may adversely impact our business and our results of operations real property collateral values may be impacted by economic conditions in the real estate market and may result in losses on loans that while adequately collateralized at the time of origination become inadequately collateralized our reliance on junior liens is concentrated in our noncommercial revolving mortgage loan portfolio approximately twothirds of the noncommercial revolving mortgage portfolio is secured by junior lien positions and lower real estate values for collateral underlying these loans may cause the outstanding balance of the senior lien to exceed the value of the collateral resulting in a junior lien loan becoming effectively unsecured inadequate collateral values rising interest rates and unfavorable economic conditions could result in greater delinquencies writedowns or chargeoffs in future periods which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and capital adequacy our financial condition could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty andor other relationships we have exposure to numerous financial services providers including banks securities brokers and dealers and other financial services providers although we monitor the financial conditions of financial institutions with which we have credit exposure transactions with those institutions expose us to credit risk through the possibility of counterparty default market risks unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business our business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national regional and local economic conditions these fluctuations are not predictable cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition our banking operations are located within several states but are locally oriented and community based our retail and commercial banking activities are primarily concentrated within the same geographic footprint our markets include the southeast midatlantic midwest and western united states with our greatest presence in north carolina and south carolina worsening economic conditions within our markets particularly within north carolina and south carolina could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows accordingly we expect to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and commercial real estate markets we serve unfavorable changes in unemployment real estate values interest rates and other factors could weaken the economies of the communities we serve economic growth and business activity have remained relatively stable across a wide range of industries and geographic locations but there can be no assurance that current economic conditions will continue or that these conditions will not worsen in addition the political environment the level of united states us debt and global economic conditions can have a destabilizing effect on financial markets weakness in any of our market areas could have an adverse impact on our earnings and consequently our financial condition and capital adequacy accounting for acquired assets may result in earnings volatility fair value discounts that are recorded at the time an asset is acquired are accreted into interest income based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the rate at which those discounts are accreted is unpredictable and the result of various factors including prepayments and changes in credit quality postacquisition deterioration in excess of remaining discounts results in the recognition of provision expense additionally the income statement impact of adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in certain fdicassisted transactions may occur over a shorter period of time than the adjustments to the covered assets fair value discount accretion postacquisition impairment and adjustments to the indemnification asset may result in significant volatility in our earnings volatility in earnings could unfavorably influence investor interest in our common stock thereby depressing the market value of our stock and the market capitalization of our company the performance of equity securities and corporate bonds in the investment portfolio could be adversely impacted by the soundness and fluctuations in the market values of other financial institutions our investment securities portfolio contains certain equity securities and corporate bonds of other financial institutions as a result a portion of our investment securities portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in the financial stability and market value of other financial institutions as well as interest rate sensitivity to economic and market conditions such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us our results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent upon net interest income interest rates are sensitive to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control including the actions of the federal reserve boards federal open market committee fomc changes in monetary policy could influence interest income interest expense and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if changes in interest rates on our interestearning assets are not equal to the changes in interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities our net interest income and therefore our net income could be adversely impacted as interest rates rise our interest expense will increase and our net interest margins may decrease negatively impacting our performance and potentially our financial condition to the extent banks and other financial services providers compete for interestbearing deposit accounts through higher interest rates our deposit base could be reduced if we are unwilling to pay those higher rates if we decide to compete with those higher interest rates our cost of funds could increase and our net interest margins could be reduced additionally higher interest rates will impact our ability to originate new loans increases in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to meet higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs which could adversely affect our business and financial condition although we maintain an interest rate risk monitoring system the forecasts of future net interest income are estimates and may be inaccurate actual interest rate movements may differ from our forecasts and unexpected actions by the fomc may have a direct impact on market interest rates we may be adversely impacted by the transition from libor as a reference rate in the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that after it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the london interbank offered rate libor this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after consequently at this time it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor similarly it is not possible to predict whether libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for liborindexed financial instruments we have loans borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor the transition from libor could create additional costs and risks since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing libor the transition will change our market risk profiles requiring changes to risk and pricing models systems contracts valuation tools and product design furthermore failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and potentially introduce additional legal risks although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from libor will be failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the value of our goodwill may decline in the future at december we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our balance sheet we test goodwill for impairment at least annually comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value we also test goodwill for impairment when certain events occur such as a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or a sustained decline in the price of our common stock these tests may result in a writeoff of goodwill deemed to be impaired which could have a significant impact on our financial results however any such writeoff would not impact our regulatory capital ratios given that regulatory capital ratios are calculated using tangible capital amounts the market price of our stock may be volatile although publicly traded our common stock has less liquidity and public float than many other large publicly traded financial services companies lower liquidity increases the price volatility of our stock and could make it difficult for our shareholders to sell or buy our common stock at specific prices excluding the impact of liquidity the market price of our common stock can fluctuate widely in response to other factors including expectations of financial and operating results actual operating results actions of institutional shareholders speculation in the press or the investment community market perception of acquisitions rating agency upgrades or downgrades stock prices of other companies that are similar to us general market expectations related to the financial services industry and the potential impact of government actions affecting the financial services industry liquidity risks if our current level of balance sheet liquidity were to experience pressure it could affect our ability to pay deposits and fund our operations our deposit base represents our primary source of core funding and balance sheet liquidity we normally have the ability to stimulate core deposit growth through reasonable and effective pricing strategies however in circumstances where our ability to generate needed liquidity is impaired we need access to noncore funding such as borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb and the federal reserve federal funds purchased lines and brokered deposits while we maintain access to these noncore funding sources some sources are dependent on the availability of collateral as well as the counterpartys willingness and ability to lend capital adequacy risks our ability to grow is contingent upon access to capital our primary capital sources have been retained earnings and debt issued through both private and public markets rating agencies regularly evaluate our creditworthiness and assign credit ratings to bancshares and fcb the ratings of the agencies are based on a number of factors some of which are outside our control in addition to factors specific to our financial strength and performance the rating agencies also consider conditions generally affecting the financial services industry there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings rating reductions could adversely affect our access to funding sources and the cost of obtaining funding based on existing capital levels bancshares and fcb are wellcapitalized under current leverage and riskbased capital standards our ability to grow is contingent on our ability to generate sufficient capital to remain wellcapitalized under current and future capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition would be adversely affected under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements bancshares together with fcb must meet certain capital and liquidity guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors we are subject to capital rules issued by the federal reserve that established a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking institutions and established a more conservative definition of capital these requirements known as basel iii became effective january and as a result we became subject to enhanced minimum capital and leverage ratios these requirements could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends restrict certain business activities or compel us to raise capital each of which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition the costs associated with complying with more stringent capital requirements such as the requirement to formulate and submit capital plans based on predefined stress scenarios on an annual basis could have an adverse effect on results of operations see item business of this form 10k for additional information regarding the capital requirements under the doddfrank act and basel iii compliance risks we operate in a highly regulated industry the laws and regulations that govern our operations taxes corporate governance executive compensation and financial accounting and reporting including changes in them or our failure to comply with them may adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of our operations in addition to a multitude of regulations designed to protect customers depositors and consumers we must comply with other regulations that protect the deposit insurance fund and the stability of the us financial system including laws and regulations that among other matters prescribe minimum capital requirements impose limitations on our business activities and investments limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay restrict the ability of our bank subsidiaries to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than gaap compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes in laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs the sarbanesoxley act of and the related rules and regulations issued by the sec and the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq as well as numerous other recently enacted statutes and regulations including the doddfrank act egrrcpa and regulations promulgated thereunder have increased the scope complexity and cost of corporate governance and reporting and disclosure practices including the costs of completing our external audit and maintaining our internal controls such additional regulation and supervision may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities the failure to comply with these various rules and regulations could subject us to restrictions on our business activities including mergers and acquisitions fines and other penalties any of which could adversely affect our results of operations capital base and the price of our common stock we may be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws and other laws and regulations corporate tax rates affect our profitability and capital levels the us corporate tax code may be further reformed by the us congress and additional guidance may be issued by the us department of the treasury relevant to the tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted during additional adverse amendments to the tax act or other legislation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations strategic risks we encounter significant competition that may reduce our market share and profitability we compete with other banks and specialized financial services providers in our market areas our primary competitors include local regional and national banks credit unions commercial finance companies various wealth management providers independent and captive insurance agencies mortgage companies and nonbank providers of financial services some of our larger competitors including certain banks with a significant presence in our market areas have the capacity to offer products and services we do not offer some of our nonbank competitors operate in less stringent regulatory environments and certain competitors are not subject to federal andor state income taxes the fierce competitive pressures that we face adversely affect pricing for many of our products and services certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt a shareholder might consider to be in their best interests certain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management the provisions could also delay or make more difficult a tender offer merger or proxy contest a shareholder might consider to be in their best interests for example our certificate of incorporation andor bylaws table start allow the board to issue and set the terms of preferred shares without further shareholder approval table endtable start limit who can call a special meeting of shareholders and table endtable start establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board and proposals of other business to be considered at annual meetings of shareholders table end these provisions as well as provisions of the bhca and other relevant statutes and regulations that require advance notice andor applications for regulatory approval of changes in control of banks and bank holding companies may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price adversely affecting its market price additionally the fact that the holding family holds or controls shares representing a majority of the voting power of our common stock may discourage potential takeover attempts andor bids for our common stock at a premium over market price we rely on dividends from fcb as a financial holding company we are a separate legal entity from fcb we derive most of our revenue and cash flow from dividends paid by fcb these dividends are the primary source from which we pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt obligations state and federal laws impose restrictions on the dividends that fcb may pay to us in the event fcb is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time we may not be able to service our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock our financial performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain clients for our products and services which ability may be adversely impacted by weakened consumer andor business confidence and by any inability on our part to predict and satisfy customers needs and demands our financial performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of client confidence and demand a fragile or weakening economy or ambiguity surrounding the economic future may lessen the demand for our products and services our performance may also be negatively impacted if we fail to attract and retain customers because we are not able to successfully anticipate develop and market products and services that satisfy market demands such events could impact our performance through fewer loans reduced fee income and fewer deposits each of which could result in reduced net income new technologies and our ability to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services to our customers present competitive risks the rapid growth of new digital technologies including internet services smart phones and other mobile devices requires us to continuously evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt and deliver our products and services in a manner responsive to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies by banks and nonbank service providers may create risks if our products and services are no longer competitive with thencurrent standards and could negatively affect our ability to attract or maintain a loyal customer base these risks may affect our ability to grow and could reduce our revenue streams from certain products and services while increasing expenses associated with developing more competitive solutions our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed pending or any potential future acquisitions we plan to continue to grow our business organically however we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategies and may enhance our profitability we must generally satisfy a number of material conditions prior to consummating any acquisition including in many cases federal and state regulatory approval we may fail to complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all acquisitions of financial institutions assets of financial institutions or other operating entities involve operational risks and uncertainties and acquired companies or assets may have unknown or contingent liabilities exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require write downs or writeoffs or difficulty retaining key employees and customers additionally acquired companies may have product lines regulatory requirements or operational challenges with which we are not familiar these among other issues could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we may not be able to realize projected cost savings synergies or other benefits associated with any such acquisition failure to efficiently integrate any acquired entities or assets into our existing operations could significantly increase our operating costs and have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying consummating or integrating any potential acquisitions financial reporting risks accounting standards may change and increase our operating costs andor otherwise adversely affect our results fasb and the sec periodically modify the standards governing the preparation of our financial statements the nature of these changes is not predictable and could impact how we record transactions in our financial statements which could lead to material changes in assets liabilities shareholders equity revenues expenses and net income in some cases we could be required to apply new or revised standards retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings implementation of new accounting rules or standards could additionally require us to implement technology changes which could impact ongoing earnings in the first quarter of we adopted a change to the methodology for the recognition and measurement of credit losses to comply with cecl this accounting standard change will result in a decrease of million to million to the bancshares allowance for credit losses acl as well as a corresponding increase to retained earnings of million to million and a decrease of million to million in deferred tax assets application of this new accounting standard resulted in additional technology investments to support enhanced modeling efforts and ongoing reporting requirements our accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how bancshares records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in bancshares reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management to make difficult subjective or complex conclusions about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates bancshares has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters bancshares cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see critical accounting policies included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is highly quantitative and requires widespread use of financial models for daytoday operations these models may produce inaccurate predictions that significantly vary from actual results we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values such models may be used in many processes including but not limited to the pricing of various products and services classifications of loans setting interest rates on loans and deposits quantifying interest rate and other market risks forecasting losses measuring capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels models may also be used to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items inaccurate or erroneous models present the risk that business decisions relying on the models will prove inefficient or ineffective additionally information we provide to our investors and regulators may be negatively impacted by inaccurately designed or implemented models for further information on models see the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and disclosures we must have effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to provide reliable financial reports to effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company if we were unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our reputation and operating results would be harmed as part of our ongoing monitoring of our internal controls over financial reporting we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies requiring remediation a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we continually work to improve our internal controls however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure appropriate and adequate controls over our future financial processes and reporting any failure to maintain effective controls or to implement any necessary improvement of our internal controls in a timely manner could among other things result in losses from fraud or error harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market value of our common stock
