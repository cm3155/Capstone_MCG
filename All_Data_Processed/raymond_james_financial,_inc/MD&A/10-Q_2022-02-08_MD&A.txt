subject to interest rate risk raymond james bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of raymond james banks asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit raymond james banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity the methods used to measure this sensitivity are described in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management market risk of our form 10k we utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of raymond james banks asset and liability management process for further information regarding this hedging strategy see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of our form 10k raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis to ensure that raymond james bank remains within its tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income the following table is an analysis of raymond james banks estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our previously described assetliability model which assumes a dynamic balance sheet and that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by raymond james banks asset and liability committee instantaneous changes

hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan

system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments including the probability of default andor loss given default of each corporate and taxexempt loan and commitment outstanding for our sbl and residential mortgage loans we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or client concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs conversely should the economy continue to recover at a faster pace than forecasted we may experience an additional benefit for credit losses andor recovery of amounts previously charged off the timing and magnitude of which can be uncertain we determine the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our form 10k as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise
