where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets changes in interest rates market volatility corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants including investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations which ultimately affect our

ended september we generated strong net revenues and pretax income for the year ended september which increased and respectively compared with the prior year our net income available to common shareholders was higher than the prior year and our earnings per diluted share increased our return on common equity roce was compared with for the prior year and our return on tangible common equity rotce was compared with for the prior year adjusted net income available to common shareholders for the year ended september which excludes the impact of million of expenses related to acquisitions completed in prior years such as compensation expenses related to retention awards and amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased compared with adjusted net income available to common shareholders for the prior year which in addition to acquisitionrelated expenses excluded the impact of a million favorable insurance settlement related to a previouslysettled legal matter our adjusted earnings per diluted share increased compared with the prior year adjusted roce was compared with for the prior year and adjusted rotce was compared with in the prior year the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees largely the result of higher pcg client assets in feebased accounts at the beginning of each of the currentyear billing periods compared with the prioryear billing periods brokerage revenues also increased compared with the prior year largely due to an increase in client activity in the pcg segment and investment banking revenues increased primarily due to more favorable market conditions in the current year offsetting these increases was a decrease in combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks as the favorable impacts of higher shortterm interest rates and higher average interestearning asset balances and rjbdp balances swept to thirdparty banks were more than offset by a significant increase in interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a shift in the mix of deposit balances at our bank segment as rjbdp balances swept to the bank segment declined compared with the prior year and a significant portion was replaced with highercost esp balances and certificate of deposit balances compensation commissions and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in compensable revenues as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth and annual salary increases our compensation ratio or the ratio of compensation commissions and benefits expense to net revenues was compared with for the prior year excluding acquisitionrelated compensation expenses our adjusted compensation ratio was compared with an adjusted compensation ratio of for the prior year the increase in the compensation ratio primarily resulted from changes in our revenue mix due to increases in compensable revenues compared with the prior year as well as a decrease in combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which have little associated direct compensation noncompensation expenses decreased largely due to a significant decrease in expenses related to legal and regulatory matters as the current year reflected net legal and regulatory matters reserve release while the prior year included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters as well as a decrease in the bank loan provision for credit losses partially offsetting these decreases in expenses was the impact of higher communications and information processing expenses resulting from continued investments in technology to benefit our clients and advisors and to support our growth the aforementioned million insurance settlement received in the prior year related to a previouslysettled legal matter that did not reoccur higher investment subadvisory fees resulting from growth in assets under management in subadvised programs and higher noninterest expenses related to deposits including the impact of a fdic special assessment in the current year occupancy and equipment and business development expenses also increased compared with the prior year our effective income tax rate was a decrease from for the prior year primarily due to the impact of a higher tax benefit recognized in the current year related to nontaxable valuation gains associated with our companyowned life insurance policies as well as a change in the amount of nondeductible fines and penalties compared with the prior year rotce

important disclosures table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end as of september tier leverage ratio was and total capital ratio was both well above regulatory capital requirements we also continued to have substantial liquidity with billion of cash at the parent as of september we believe our capital and funding position provide us the opportunity to manage our balance sheet prudently and to continue to be opportunistic and invest in growth during the year ended september we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the board of directors common stock repurchase authorization for million at an average price of per share after the effect of those repurchases million remained under the boards authorization in total we returned billion of capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends in the fiscal year we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock to offset dilution from sharebased compensation and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases given our capital and liquidity levels we expect to maintain or potentially increase our share repurchase activity levels however we will continue to monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we consider the magnitude and timing of these repurchases as we look ahead we believe we are wellpositioned for longterm growth with our strong capital and liquidity position total client assets under administration of trillion and net bank loans of billion we expect our fiscal first quarter of results to be favorably impacted by higher asset management and related administrative fees which will benefit from the increase in both pcg feebased assets and financial assets under management from june to september in addition our financial advisor recruiting activity remains robust including a strong recruiting pipeline we also have a healthy investment banking pipeline and we expect investment banking revenues to benefit as the market environment becomes more constructive for transaction closings over the next few quarters although the market is still challenging we expect fixed income brokerage revenues to benefit from increased activity from depository institutions resulting from decreases in shortterm interest rates and the yield curve steepening while the decline in shortterm interest rates is expected to have a favorable impact on certain of our businesses we anticipate our combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks will decrease in our fiscal due to the 50basis point and 25basis point decreases in shortterm interest rates enacted by the fed in september and november respectively although the magnitude of such decline is largely dependent on the level of shortterm interest rates including any additional rate cuts in our fiscal our interestearning asset levels client cash balances and other factors that may impact the current market environment while we maintain discipline in controlling our expenses we continue to invest to support growth across our businesses which may increase expenses in future periods corporate loan growth has remained muted in fiscal but we believe we are wellpositioned to increase lending as new origination activity increases which may increase provisions for credit losses in future periods in addition although our current loan portfolio credit metrics are solid and we continue to proactively manage our credit risk in our loan portfolio future economic deterioration or changes in the macroeconomic outlook could also result in increased bank loan provisions for credit losses in future periods year ended september compared with the year ended september refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our sandreports within other reports and information banking operations our bank segment maintains an interestearning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash sbl ci loans cre loans reit loans residential mortgage loans and taxexempt loans as well as an availableforsale securities portfolio these interestearning assets are primarily funded by client deposits based on the current asset portfolio our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk we analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of our asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve we utilize hedging strategies using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a component of our asset and liability management process for additional information regarding this hedging strategy see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k we also manage interest rate risk as part of our liquidity management framework see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this form 10k for additional information to ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts including deposit betas and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income the following table is an analysis of our banking operations estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our previously described assetliability model which assumes a dynamic balance sheet a weighted average deposit beta on our interestbearing deposit accounts without stated maturities of approximately as interest rates rise and approximately as interest rates fall and that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the asset and liability committee table start instantaneous changes in rate net interest income in millions projected change in net interest income table end our 0basis point scenario was based on interest rates as of september and did not include the impact of the feds november decrease in shortterm interest rates the preceding table does not include the impacts of an instantaneous change in interest rates on net interest income on assets and liabilities outside of our banking operations or on our rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and are included in account and service fees on our consolidated statements of income and table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end comprehensive income refer to

securities portfolio we hold primarily fixedrate agencybacked mbs agencybacked cmos and us treasuries which are carried at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through other comprehensive income oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as the majority of our availableforsale securities portfolio is comprised of us government and government agencybacked securities changes in fair value are primarily driven by changes in interest rates at september our availableforsale securities portfolio had a fair value of billion with a weightedaverage yield of and a weightedaverage life after factoring in estimated prepayments of years to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of our availableforsale securities portfolio we also monitor among other things effective duration defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100basis point change in rates as of september the effective duration of our availableforsale securities portfolio was approximately which means that we would expect the market value of our availableforsale securities portfolio to increase approximately for every 100basis point decline in interest rates and decline approximately for every 100basis point increase in interest rates see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on our availableforsale securities portfolio the asset and liability committee also reviews eve which is a point in time analysis of current interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities that incorporates cash flows over their estimated remaining lives discounted at current rates the eve approach is based on a static balance sheet and provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels as the changes in eve indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows we monitor sensitivity to changes in eve utilizing board of directorsapproved limits these limits set a risk tolerance to changing interest rates and assist in determining strategies for mitigating this risk as eve approaches these limits as of september our eve analyses were within approved limits the following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at september including contractual principal repayments maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms however rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in maturities in the

loan portfolio our banking operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd for example our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling billion and billion at september and respectively when converted to usd a majority of such loans are held in a canadian subsidiary of raymond james bank raymond james bank utilizes shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign exchange risk related to such investment in this canadian subsidiary these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information regarding these derivatives other sources of foreign exchange risk investments in nonbank foreign subsidiaries at september we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd of cad million and in our investment in charles stanley of million which were not hedged we had other less significant investments in foreign domiciled subsidiaries primarily in europe which were not hedged however we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually or in the aggregate pertaining to these subsidiaries as of september foreign exchange gainslosses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information regarding our components of oci transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the usd any currencyrelated gainslosses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore the related gainslosses are included in other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information regarding our derivatives table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities corporate activities we maintain cash balances with the fed and with various financial institutions primarily global systemically important financial institutions in our normal course of business a large portion of such balances are in excess of fdic insurance limits as a result we may be exposed to the risk that these financial institutions may not return our cash to us in the event that the institution experiences financial distress or ceases its operations in order to mitigate our credit risk to such financial institutions we monitor our exposure with each institution on a daily basis and subject each institution to limits based on various factors including but not limited to financial strength capitalization levels liquidity credit ratings and market factors to the extent applicable brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks exchanges clearing organizations and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations in addition certain commitments including underwritings may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument in addition we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security derivative and loan concentrations holding collateral as security for certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities we offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities our bank segment has a substantial loan portfolio our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification across loan types geographic locations industries and clients regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and taxexempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes periodic independent reviews of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information we seek to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses we use a credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments for our sbl and residential mortgage loans we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance historical experience through various economic cycles industry or client table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs we determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each loan portfolio segment and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k we segregate our loan portfolio into six loan portfolio segments which also serve as classes of financing receivables for purposes of credit analysis the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows sbl loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and to a lesser extent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by investmentgrade insurance companies an insignificant portion of our sbl portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market substantially all sbl are monitored daily for adherence to loantovalue ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status the vast majority of our sbl qualify for the practical expedient allowed under the cecl guidance whereby we estimate zero credit losses to the extent the fair value of the collateral securing the loan equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the loan sbl also generally qualify for lower capital requirements under regulatory capital rules ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business and repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business in addition we also have certain owneroccupied commercial real estate loans of approximately million as of september that were classified as ci loans as the primary source of repayment for these loans is based on the financial strength of the owner and the cash flows of the respective business rather than the ability of the collateral to generate cash flows unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties the underlying cash flows generated by properties securing these loans may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates which are monitored on an ongoing basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which involve risks such as project budget overruns performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors or the inability to sell the project or secure permanent financing once the project is completed with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and the general economic table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment the level of chargeoff activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses the following table presents net loan

collateral performance loan covenant compliance municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations geographic concentrations and total relationship exposure in addition credit quality trends are monitored by industry to determine if a change in the risk exposure to a certain industry may warrant incremental monitoring or tightening of our underwriting standards during times of market uncertainty we also utilize loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our corporate bank loans we use a credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and the related unfunded lending commitments the majority of loans in our corporate loan portfolio are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrowers ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement this process includes reviewing borrowers financial information and other creditrelated documentation public information and other information specific to each borrower and loan as part of the credit review process the loan rating is reviewed at least annually or more frequently based on policy requirements regarding various risk characteristics to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit the individual loan ratings resulting from semiannual snc exams are incorporated in our internal loan ratings when the ratings are received if the snc rating is lower on an individual loan than our internal rating the loan is downgraded while we consider historical snc exam results in our loan ratings methodology differences between the snc exam and internal ratings on individual loans typically arise due to subjectivity of the loan classification process downgrades resulting from these differences may result in additional provisions for credit losses in periods when snc exam results are received see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on our allowance for credit losses policies our corporate bank loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry

inflation including through increases in shortterm interest rates in prior fiscal years resulted in relatively high interest rates throughout most of our fiscal which coupled with the uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of fed interest rate cuts during fiscal had a negative impact on borrowers marketwide corporate loan growth has remained low in fiscal but we believe we are wellpositioned to increase lending as new origination activity increases which may increase provisions for credit losses in future periods we continue to closely monitor economic factors including inflation and interest rates that may impact our corporate loan portfolio additionally in our fiscal we have sold and may continue to sell in our fiscal corporate loans as part of our credit risk mitigation strategies the effects of recent macroeconomic factors including changes in business and consumer behavior have most notably impacted the commercial real estate sector specifically risk related to office real estate loans has increased due to the increase in remote work pressure from higher interest rates uncertainty related to tenant lease renewals and elevated refinancing risks for loans with nearterm maturities among other issues to mitigate risks related to our cre portfolio the expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed incomeproducing property commitments are stress tested to reflect risks related to varying interest rates vacancy rates and rental rates additionally we continue to maintain conservative underwriting standards including ltv limits that generally range between to at origination depending upon property type and in times of uncertainty we may originate loans at even tighter thresholds currently ltv at origination is generally at or below for newlyoriginated cre loans these ltv ratios are subject to change over the life of the loan as property values change we seek to mitigate our refinancing risks in our cre portfolio by subjecting loans with stated maturities in the near term to enhanced monitoring procedures for example approximately of our office real estate loans are scheduled to mature in calendar years and such office real estate loans with nearterm maturities are subject to monthly reporting if a loan reaches our lowest pass rating we also remain in frequent contact with the related borrowers well in advance of a loans stated maturity to take action on the loan ahead of any credit concerns including working with the borrower to restructure the loan as necessary and ensuring that our allowances for
