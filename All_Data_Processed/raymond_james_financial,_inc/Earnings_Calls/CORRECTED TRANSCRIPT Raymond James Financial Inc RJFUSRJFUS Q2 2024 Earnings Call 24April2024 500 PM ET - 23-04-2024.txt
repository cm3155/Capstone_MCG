they will continue delivering on our mission to help clients achieve their financial objectives now to review the second quarter results starting on slide sic slide the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of billion an increase of over the preceding year quarter primarily due to higher asset based revenues quarterly net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share the quarter included the favorable impact of a legal and regulatory net reserve release of million predominantly driven by a reduction in the reserve related to the sec offplatform communications matter we generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of a great result particularly given our strong capital base moving on to slide client assets grew to record levels during the quarter driven by rising equity markets and solid advisor retention and recruiting in the private client group total client assets under administration increased sequentially to trillion private client group assets in feebased accounts grew to billion and financial assets under management reached billion domestic net new assets were billion representing a annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic private client group assets this quarter does reflect some seasonality typical in the first calendar quarter and as weve seen before net new assets can be volatile quartertoquarter as we onboard newly recruited advisors and have advisors retire or leave the platform from timetotime with our robust technology capabilities client first values and longtime multiple affiliated options pcg continues to attract high quality advisors to the platform for example during the quarter we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing month production and billion of client assets at their previous firm fiscal yeartodate trailing 12month production of recruited advisors is up and related assets up over the prior sixmonth period there is a lag between recruiting results and net new assets as it takes some time for clients to transition to the raymond james platform but we are encouraged by the recruiting success so far this fiscal year and these results do not include our ria and custody services business which also continues to have recruiting success and finished the quarter with billion of client assets under administration looking to our fiscal yeartodate results domestic net new assets were billion representing a annualized growth rate on the beginning of period domestic pcg assets a strong result compared to our peers raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 total clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up slightly over december bank loans were essentially flat from the preceding quarter at billion as loan demand remains relatively muted given higher rates moving on to slide private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear results were driven by higher asset management fees reflecting the nearly growth of assets in feebased accounts at the beginning of the current quarter compared with the same prior year period the capital markets segments generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax loss of million net revenues grew compared to a year ago quarter primarily due to higher ma and debt underwriting revenues sequentially revenues declined due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues and ma and advisory revenues partially offset by higher debt underwriting revenues the pretax loss in capital markets of million reflects the impact of amortization of deferred compensation granted in preceding periods which totaled million this quarter while the timing of closings remains difficult to predict we are encouraged by the healthy pipeline for new business activity and ma we continue to expect investment banking revenues to improve along with the industry wide gradual recovery the asset management segment generated pretax income of million on record net revenues of million results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into pcg feebased accounts the bank segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million bank segment net interest margin of declined basis points compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to the higher cost mix of deposits as the enhanced savings program balances replaced a portion of the lower cost rjbdp cash sweep balances looking to the fiscal yearend date results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record net income available to common shareholders of million up and respectively over the prior years record additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of and an annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the sixmonth period on slide the strength of the pcg and asset management segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects the strong organic growth in pcg with robust equity markets and now ill turn over to paul shoukry our cfo and soon to be ceo for the second quarter results paul paul m shoukry president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting on slide consolidated net revenues were billion in the second quarter up over the prior year and up sequentially asset management and related administrative fees grew to billion representing growth over the prior year and over the preceding quarter this quarter pcg feebased assets increased which will be a strong tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter brokerage revenues of million grew yearoveryear mostly due to higher brokerage revenues in pcg which were partially offset by lower fixed income brokerage raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 revenues as depository clients continued to experience flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities remember in our fixed income business we do not have the same exposure to the higher volatility currency and credit products that have benefited many of the larger players in our industry during the quarter ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million increased yearoveryear and declined sequentially compared to the prior year quarter second quarter results benefited from stronger debt underwriting revenues in both fixed income and public finance as well as improvement in ma and advisory revenues which continued to be subdued moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up slightly over the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets sweep balances were essentially flat and esp balances increased sequentially both outperforming our expectations on the last call since the beginning of this quarter domestic cash sweep balances have declined about billion mostly due to quarterly fee billings along with income tax payments turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million down from the preceding quarter largely reflecting one fewer billable day again this result outperformed our guidance on last quarters call given the more stable client cash balances going forward net interest income and rjbdp thirdparty fees will largely be dependent on the level of shortterm interest rates the stability of client cash balances and the trajectory of loan growth which has been subdued in this rate environment fortunately we are well positioned for the eventual recovery in loan growth with ample capital and funding flexibility moving to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was excluding acquisitionrelated compensation expenses the adjusted compensation ratio was as is typical in the first calendar quarter compensation expenses were impacted by annual salary increases and the reset of payroll taxes all in an adjusted compensation ratio close to is in line with our current target and is the satisfactory result given the challenging environment for the capital markets segment noncompensation expenses of million increased sequentially largely due to higher communications and information processing expenses and a higher bank loan loss provision which were partially offset by a favorable legal and regulatory net reserve release of million in the quarter which paul mentioned earlier for the fiscal year we still expect noncompensation expenses excluding provision for credit losses unexpected legal and regulatory items or nongaap adjustments to be around billion this implies incremental non compensation growth throughout the year as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for advisors and their clients throughout our businesses keep in mind many of our noncompensation expenses such as investment subadvisory fees represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters this quarter we generated a pretax margin of and adjusted pretax margin of a strong result especially given the challenging market conditions impacting capital markets as a reminder our current targets provided at our analyst and investor day last may are for pretax margin of 20plus and a compensation ratio of less than we still think these targets are appropriate and we will provide an update as needed at our upcoming analyst investor day scheduled for may raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 on slide at quarter end total balance sheet assets were billion a sequential increase liquidity and capital remain very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target and we remain well capitalized with tier leverage ratio of and a total capital ratio of our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate for the quarter was reflecting the favorable impact of nontaxable corporate owned life insurance gains in the quarter looking ahead we believe is an appropriate estimate for the effective tax rate slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share including million of shares repurchased in april we completed the expected million of these share repurchases since january and fulfilled the repurchase commitment associated with the dilution from the tristate capital acquisition as of april approximately billion remained under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization going forward we expect to continue to offset share based compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases we are committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets and well discuss more on our overall capital management strategy at our upcoming analyst investor day lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at up from from the preceding quarter the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of the corporate loans held for investment was at quarter end we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios before i turn the call back over to paul i just want to say that i am absolutely honored to be named president and future ceo of this great firm i am excited to partner with my colleagues and friends scott curtis tash elwyn and jim bunn in their expanded roles to continue leading raymond james with the same values that guided bob james tom james and paul reilly since our founding i am optimistic about our future as all of our businesses have critical mass significant headroom for continued growth and a highly competent management team that embody our firms advisor and client first values now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i said at the start of the call im pleased with our results for the fiscal second quarter and through the first half of the fiscal year generating record results and ending the quarter with record client assets and while there is still economic uncertainty i believe we are in a position of strength to drive growth over the longterm across all of our businesses in the private client group the next quarter results will be positively impacted by the sequential increase of assets in feebased accounts our advisor recruiting activity remains robust and i am encouraged by a record raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 number of large teams in the pipeline we are focused on being a destination of choice for our current and prospective advisors which we believe over the long term should continue to drive industry leading growth in the capital markets segment we continue to have a healthy ma pipeline and good engagement levels but our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions and we could expect activity to pick up over the next six to nine months and in the fixed income business the overall dynamic of the past year remained unchanged depository clients are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity we hope that once rate and cash balances stabilize we will start to see an improvement overall despite some of the nearterm challenges we believe the investments weve made in the capital markets business have positioned us well for growth once the market and rate environment become conducive in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter up over the preceding quarter which should provide a tailwind to revenues we remain confident that strong growth of assets and feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management to help drive further growth over time in the bank segment we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diverse funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand we have seen securities based loan payoffs decelerate and we expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates with little activity in the market corporate loan growth has been muted however with ample client cash balances and capital we are wellpositioned to lend once activity increases and our conservative risk guidelines in addition to driving organic growth across our businesses we also remain focused on the corporate development efforts for opportunities that may meet our disciplined ma parameters in closing we are well positioned entering the fiscal third quarter with a strong competitive positioning in all of our business and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth as always i want to thank our advisors who drive this business and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients thank you for all you do that concludes our prepared remarks operator will you please open the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 question and answer section operator absolutely operator instructions well go first today to alex blostein goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon thanks for the question and congrats to both of you guys well deserved i wanted to start with a question around comp maybe i understand there are some seasonal factors that impacted the quarter but maybe help break down how much the seasonal lift was specifically this quarter it feels a little bit heavier than normal and then paul i think i heard you say that youre kind of on target to comp rate for the year but then you also said youre still shooting to be below for the year so maybe just kind of help reconcile where you guys ultimately expect to end up for the full year thanks paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah alex i appreciate that what we said was that the target that we announced at the last analystinvestor day was and so thats sort of where weve been trending in the first two quarters but thats kind of what it does for the rest of the year is going to be largely dependent on the capital markets segment thats a big driver typically that would have a lower capital ratio comp ratio associated with it than the other segments and help the firms overall comp ratio and that wasnt the case this quarter as you can calculate so we were pleased to be able to generate close to the adjusted comp ratio despite the challenges in that capital markets segment in terms of the reset of the payroll taxes and the increase in salaries thats typical for the calendar first quarter of each year i would say that probably had an impact around million to million in the quarter so yeah meaningful impact in the quarter of course the salary increases will continue throughout the year but probably twothirds of that or so was related to the payroll tax reset which will decline throughout the course of the calendar year alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you thanks for that my second question around recruiting activity and if we look at the net new assets disclosed in the quarter organic growth is trending at a lower end from what weve seen from you guys historically and i guess double clicking into that it looks like the independent head count continues to be pretty range bound so maybe kind of walk us through whats been sort of pressuring the net new asset growth so far this year your expectations for the rest of the year and then specifically what you are seeing in the independent channel thats been keeping the head count relatively flat thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think youre seeing the same trends that the teams were hiring are larger so were bringing in more assets were on a great roll in terms of assets in trailing we do have head count that moves to our ria channel and that takes them out of head count because theyre not licensed so even with that movement we can keep the raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 assets but were not keeping the head count and well try to give you more granularity on investor day analyst day and then you have the ins and outs so we do have some outs and the ins take time to on board so the assets usually take when you see a robust quarter like lets say the million of trailing we could take months to a year to get all those assets over so our expectation is that the recruiting will continue and continue strong and i think part of the transparency is we need to give people more transparency on the ria and how to think about that weve struggled with the measurement indiscernible so you can see through those alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great all right thank you guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks alex operator the next question is steven chubak wolfe research michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon this is michael anagnostakis on for steven i did want to ask one just on cash sweep i appreciate the commentary on how things have trended to start the quarter and it was certainly nice to see that sweep cash was flat in but now tax season is behind us so are you seeing signs that cash sweep is building inflecting positively and maybe just speak to your level of confidence that we can see absolute sweep cash balances build from here thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean we had tax season we also had a record quarterly fee billing that came out of the cash balances already and so i look at todays report cash sweep balances so far in april are down billion which is less than the impact from the fee billings now we had some decline in the enhanced savings program so far this april too and again that could have been impacted we have tracked significant payments to the irs with the tax season here and if you look at the last couple of quarters after the fee payments were made cash kind of built throughout the quarter and you saw that certainly in this past quarter where cash sweep balances ended relatively flat quarteroverquarter which far exceeded our expectations that we shared on the last call so we are hopeful that balances are stabilizing and so well kind of continue monitoring it from here michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it and maybe just pivoting to dol paul on the last earnings call i recall you were relatively comfortable with ray js positioning and that you expected the industry to challenge the new rule with the final dol rule now published maybe you can update us on your views in terms of what the rule in its finalized state means for the industry as well as any implications for ray j that you would highlight thanks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well yeah so i appreciate the question digesting pages of a regulatory rule is a little more even more complicated than trying to get through our earnings release so well analyze that so its early the early read is actually from the rule itself is we there is nothing that pops out thats overly problematic or actually maybe surprisingly so i think the industrys concern will be two one is that does the department of labor even have the authority to oversee these accounts and that doesnt have to do with this rule i dont think the rule itself will have a high impact but do we want another regulator that can see the statutory authority for the regulator to oversee those accounts and the other thing is if the rule is talking about really complying with best interest standard why is there an extra rule but the rule itself is i think much more manageable than the draft rule was so again thats an early read the devil is always in the detail but i dont think the rule itself from what it requires to do today is it doesnt look too problematic at all michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc certainly appreciate that and congratulations to you both thanks for taking my questions paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you operator next question comes from michael cho jpmorgan michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good evening thanks for taking my question my first one i just wanted to followup on ma again i mean just you talked through a healthy pipeline looking ahead but just in the quarter again you also talked to some seasonality and some lumpiness i was just curious if theres anything else you can call out or any more color on nuances between maybe some of the affiliation models that you talk through and maybe anything to call out in terms of how maybe attrition is trending as well paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc if you look for the first six months i think compared to the industry in the i think we did pretty well so this quarter was slower in terms of the number typically this is little lower but a lower maybe a little lower than we would have thought in terms of the number itself but the recruiting is going well the movement to ria you could see that net new assets growth was pretty robust i mean net asset growth was pretty robust so i think it actually was a we have quarters where things are down and quarters where things are up and i just think it was down a little more than we anticipated from a measurement standpoint but the recruiting not only and what we brought in this quarter but what we have in the pipeline i think we have a relatively good chance of closing and i cant remember ever being stronger raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 so the numbers will be impacted by in terms of advisor count how many go to ria and then hopefully the ones that do will choose to stay with us and weve had a pretty good record on it so far michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you fair enough and then just switching gears to the capital markets business i mean i realize some of that is driven by that deferred comp that you called out and maybe still recovering ma environment i guess so with that backdrop potentially improving from here and raymond james history of investing in talent as well i mean how would you frame your willingness to go after incremental talent in the advisory business over the next call it to months paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so weve done a lot of adjusting in terms of the costs knowing the cost in that business but weve also done some hiring so the business is very leverage the upside if revenue comes up i mean so the margin two years ago was what or something i mean so now its not so i mean theres leverage for the revenue to grow to really help with that margin so the question is just the market and were open always to bring in talent i think we showed in and the worst part of we were hiring when other people arent really paid off for our growth through the whole next decade and so that is the blessing of a really strong capital position and so we have the opportunity even in tough markets to hire carry and really position talent to bring us forward weve done some fixed public finance hiring that were already seeing payoff from in the last this quarter and this coming quarter that if you looked at just the results of public finance the way theyve done it but were again great believers in the business the platform and if theres great talent out there were willing to take the longterm investment and some liquidity and capitalized support to do that michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect thank you so much paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you operator the next question is brennan hawken ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good afternoon thanks for taking my questions and congrats to both of you im curious about the idea now that were starting to see capital markets get going activity begin to pick up how should we think about incremental margins in that business for you given how weak the profitability has been i would assume that they would be pretty good but could you help us get a sense of what a incremental dollar of revenue would mean from an incremental margin perspective raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think maybe the only thing we can really point to is the margins peaking out in the mid i think it was in in that time period and so theres a lot of upside to the margins from where we are today and just remember this quarter was impacted by million of deferred comp amortization from those record years as well which will run off over the course of the next to months because those are threeyear deferrals typically so theres a lot of upside we have a very strong franchise now in investment banking the pipelines and the leading activity levels are good closings are difficult to predict just in this market environment but we think theres a lot of upside to both the top and bottom line in our capital markets segment paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and if we didnt we would be doing wed be taking a lot of different actions than weve taken so far i think weve prudently cut expenses and making sure that we have the right people on the field but we think we have a great team and as the market recovers i believe theyll do very well brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank sure fair enough and then thinking about the improving environment if we continue to see signs of recovering strength in your core businesses will that increase confidence and improve the likelihood for a better outlook for capital returns and buybacks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think our capital philosophy hasnt changed in that we would love to add to the business invest in the business first and certainly our recruiting of ongoing large investments which is certainly i dont think anyone thinks is a bad investment were looking for ma opportunities and are active in the market but we cant predict the timing and certainly were committed to buy dilution back and be opportunistic but we dont want the capital levels we think that these levels are high and we want to manage on it so we will be meeting with the board and i think by the analyst and investor days may have better insight to how we may do that but the profitability were not trying to hoard capital and benefit us but well always be higher probably than most firms but this is a pretty robust level we acknowledge that so brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank okay paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think our commitment for those on this call thinking wed do a buyback that averaged plus you would have thought we would have done that even a quarter or two ago so were trying to manage the levels raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank appreciate that color operator the next question is dan fannon jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good evening just to follow up on that last question can you talk about ma and really what do you think makes the most sense in terms of strategic fit from a product geography or scale perspective paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah we could go into a long i mean thats a hard question to answer quickly i mean our primary geographies are north america and then europe that we look for the best opportunities in each business the opportunities are different in our private client group its really north america and the uk our ma group is much broader were on the continent not really in asia but not against ma capability more than we have today asset management its particular products and we can go on and on and on so we think in all the areas of the firm there are areas that we can grow that strategically help us through acquisition but that would be a lot longer in lot more detail than that general question so each business has different needs ma we think there are areas that we could expand the private client group we think our geographies weve done well in the northeast but could do more and were really focused on growing in the west more robustly so the answer is a lot of areas if we can find the right opportunities and make a reasonable return for shareholders that we would execute on daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood and then as you think about nii going forward and you mentioned in the kind of cash trends and some stabilization there on the loan growth side any signs of pickup in potential demand there or as you think about the rest of this year what are the kind of most sensitive factors as we think about that line item in terms of up or down paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah as you know loan growth has been tepid not only for us but for the really entire banking industry since rates started rising over the last to months and a lot of that is due to just the higher rate environment and a lot of corporations and investors coming into this environment flush with cash we are optimistic about loan growth going forward we dont know exactly when that inflection point will hit but we do think that theres a demand building up both for companies who will eventually get back engaged in ma and other investing activities as well as the private client group investors so one of the reasons that we are maintaining strong capital and funding positions and a lot of flexibility is to be in a position of strength when that loan growth does resume because it is just a matter of in our minds just a matter of timing for when that loan growth recovers and so were well positioned for it we dont know when that will come back but were optimistic about the growth going forward raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator up next is a question from mark mclaughlin bank of america mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you both i wanted to get your take with regard to advisor movements what have you guys been seeing on your ends in terms of advisors leaving wirehouses and also competition between independent broker dealers is there anything to call out paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc just that the competition is still robust i mean the advisor movement especially of large teams has been where we have been focused has been big i think private equitys investment into the ria space has caused more movement too into outside of the independent broker dealers than employee broker dealers so thats kind of a new factor for us so part of the reasons why a decade ago we started investing to have our ria channel so we could be competitive so yeah i mean i cant remember a time where there hasnt been a lot of competition but we still see wirehouse movement in our favor i think that youre seeing more people not reporting advisor count for that reason but we see a lot of activity but its competitive there are a lot of people out there competing and at the end of the day its not just money i think what people think the highest bidders get it if you look at our we just saw the latest industry ph sars were still lower than most firms by a fair margin in our transition assistance but its clearly up from a couple of years ago reflecting the competition so its competitive but we believe our platform is what lands people in our culture and so far its continuing but its not easy its hard work mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc thanks i appreciate that color and then im sure well get an update on this at the investor day but with respect to rcs what are you guys seeing in terms of advisors moving especially the size of those advisors i realize for the most part its usually advisors once they reach kind of sort of a critical mass are you seeing the size of the advisors wanting to move over to ria kind of move down in scale paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc look in the market theres certainly a lot of movement of smaller teams that want to become rias and big teams that have the infrastructure to be ria so the movement is really kind of across the board larger teams indiscernible positives and challenges of rias is you can affiliate with a firm but they have multiple custodians so i think that if you look at set large rias some of the big custodial firms they still move asset sometimes so you dont have to have a firm affiliate with you to be an asset gainer too so the dynamic of that its a much more dynamic industry in that way its kind of all or none in the registered rep side and its a fight for wallet on the ria side raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you operator well now take a question from kyle voigt kbw kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening i just have a couple of follow ups maybe first just to follow up on dans ma question and i guess just to be clear on the capital point do you feel like you have enough capital flexibility today with the current leverage ratios to act on the ma opportunities that youre seeing in the market or is the nearterm guidance on buybacks to offset dilution and imply continued near term capital build due to maybe wanting a bit more flexibility due to the size of the acquisition opportunities that youre seeing paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think were in the ballpark of flexibility the question just is that question maybe you see something where it could be bigger but you cant just wait and wait and wait with total capital weve drifted up once if i remember right all or something and people are saying what are you doing but we had three deals that we executed in one year that brought it down so we hit and its been building back up so if it was so smooth and we could forecast that it would be real easy right but ma kind of hits deals sometimes come almost out of the blue or someone just decides theyre going to sell and so thats why if we average up sometimes we feel like the market will have opportunities that we can foreshadow but that doesnt mean were right theres one thing to enter into a discussion its another thing for a seller to agree its time and pick us and to close so thats the challenge but many of the deals that we have closed is because we could execute and we could we were not only were they attractive to us but there was a certainty of closing both financially and that we had enough cash on hand that it wasnt a leap that we in the financing because were not leveraged isnt a leap but we can close very very quickly so i wish i could give you a science to it theres little more art to it and thats we would love to be as clear as we can on this but if we had the magic formula we would let you know or at least package it and sell it to our competitors kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats very helpful thank you and then just for a follow up on the loan balances i think you gave some commentary on sbls a few quarters ago that you actually see some decent demand and some of the acceleration in that book the growth of that book that you were seeing in the calendar third quarter was due to some paydown slowing so i guess a bit surprising to see that growth has stalled out here in the past quarter just wondering if you can provide any additional color on whats happening in the sbl book specifically which is flat lines here and then do you think the market really just needs to wait for rates to move lower before demand broadens again raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc it was flattish for us as you point out sequentially as it was i think through the rest of the industry at least those whove reported thus far so im not sure you necessarily need to wait for rates to decrease its just maybe a stabilization of rates even as borrowers get used to sort of the new norm so i think thats really what were seeing as we transition from historically low rates to where our current level is at an unprecedented pace its just a lot of people are still getting used to and companies are still getting used to this level of rates kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much and congrats again to both of you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks kyle paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks operator your next question comes from michael cyprys morgan stanley michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask on organic asset growth i think in the past youve suggested that most of the growth and any growth that youre seeing is from recruiting just curious how you think about an opportunity set over time from maybe providing advisors with more services to enhance their efficiency and unlock growth from the installed advisor base to grow samestore sales paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think our focus internally is first to our existing advisors both technology and capabilities to make sure theyre spending as much time as they can with their clients and acquiring new clients it makes the advisors happy that means your clients are happy to achieve this growth for us so our focus and its ph evolves the platforms for other advisors that want to come to so the tools we put out the technology we put out the back office modernization all of that is to help advisor productivity and that does drive a lot of our growth and what we do and keeps advisors here this is a market and frankly the market has been this way for a while where almost any advisor could leave and they will get a lot of money for their book and start somewhere else but they stay here because of that so thats a big focus of ours thats where we pay a lot of attention number one is on retention and i think part of our growth rates have been driven by our retention rates too and our recruiting so im not sure if theres more of the question but thats kind of focus number one is to make the existing advisors happy and productive raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and then just on the loan book just curious where you think youre underpenetrated as you look at the portfolio today and if you look out over the next couple years how would you sort of like the composition and size of the book to evolve and are there any additional capabilities you feel you may need to build out paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah theres two pieces to that were underpenetrated compared to wirehouses in terms of loans to clients you would say yes but our other thing is we take a position with advisors your job is to do the right thing for your clients and if our loans or if you like our mortgage loans use them if you dont if its somethings better else for your clients use it so our job is to provide competitive products and your advisors job is to figure out whats appropriate for their client to use so we do not have quotas we do not put incentives some people have product incentives for their top ph top reps or their managers have quotas to try to do that we have none of that we just want advisors to do whats best for the business and then we try to develop compelling products and services that they can educate that they can use on use to help their clients so our numbers industrywide are lower but we understand why because were not pushing it or we do it through education not through trying to use incentives to get them to do it so now you can talk about from a capital allocation standpoint that might be different from our side of what loans wed like to grow the good news for us is we like the private client group loans the sbls and mortgages the other things that they have not only sbls have our best risk adjusted return theyre secured and theyre good for clients and theyre flexible for clients so were matched up that way so our challenges are more where do we want to go and whether its the commercial banking section or how much ph do we want investment securities now that that are more of a financial decision and long term investment so penetration is a good question we are lower but we dont try to force it we want our advisors to do it if its the right thing for the clients michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator next up is bill katz td cowen william katz q analyst td cowen okay thank you very much and congratulations everybody question for you just on the nim the net interest margin sort of wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe where the exit level might be for the new quarter and just given sort of the reinvestment rates of what might be rolling on rolling off and in a world of a tepid type of loan backdrop for now how do you sort of see that playing out if the sorting starts to ease a little bit as well thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say a lot of the shift in cash balances from on balance sheet to third party banks have really occurred in the last couple of quarters so the nim going forward is going to be more driven by one the absolute level of rates and what happens with shortterm rates going forward and also to the asset mix to the extent were a little heavy right now on the bank balance sheet and cash balances going back to the comments i made earlier about wanting to be in a position of strength when loan demand recovers and so that brings down the nim all else being equal but its at least a push if not a modest positive to nii net interest income and earnings but in the meantime it does drag down the nim a bit as we hold more cash balances than we think we would need on a run rate basis so as far as a jumping off point i think it is a relatively stable number from where we were this quarter were not shifting proactively shifting cash balances off balance sheet to thirdparty banks that we were doing over the last couple of quarters so i think thats all fairly well reflected this quarter william katz q analyst td cowen great thats helpful and just try and triangulate a combination of the senior executive leadership changes your comments paul shoukry about sort of the platform being in a very good spot with scale where are you investing right now as you think through maybe the comp or noncomp side and how might the strategic vision be evolving as you sort of migrate to the next generation of leaders thank you paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i mean we have been consistently investing in all of our businesses first and foremost the largest business by far is our private client group business and we dont anticipate that changing so thats where the vast majority of our investment dollars go but we also invest heavily in growth in the capital markets asset management and the bank businesses and theyre all great businesses if you look at the last three years and even the first half of this fiscal year being able to generate record revenues and earnings in very different market environments is a testament and a reflection of having a diversified business model so were going to continue to invest in very high service levels continue to invest in technology to enhance the service levels and create more efficiencies for advisors so they could spend more time with clients as paul was touching on earlier so kind of maybe a long winded way of saying theres not going to be a dramatic change because everything is really working very well and has been since our founding in and being focused on essentially the same businesses that were focused on today and so thats sort of our plan going forward william katz q analyst td cowen thank you congrats again operator and our final question today will come from devin ryan citizens jmp devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 hey yeah thanks so much for squeezing me in and obviously want to echo the congratulation as well to paul shoukry and the others on the leadership team now on the call and to paul reilly as well the stock i think was trading at about when you joined in i remember those days pretty well and so unquestionably a successful run and a wellearned transition so congratulations i wanted real quick a couple here on fixed income brokerage you had a very significant step up in the first quarter off of the back half of and then that took a step back again in the second quarter and just curious was that just a shift in activity in depositories just with the changes in rate expectations or is something else going on there and just how to think about that business relative to maybe the second quarter coming off point paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah it was couple quarters ago the rates came down quite the yields came down quite a bit and gave depositories a repositioning opportunity and on the call last quarter i think we talked about that repositioning opportunity being somewhat episodic in nature and throughout the course of this quarter the rates actually went up again and so the underlying factors that paul discussed on the call in his prepared remarks was that depositories are still struggling to grow deposit balances or keep deposit balances flat and so theyre going to be prudent and slow to reinvest in securities in this environment and thats the largest part of our fixed income business so we continue to expect some headwinds there until deposit balances start growing again and banks feel more confident investing in their securities portfolio meanwhile some which has been nice in that it has diversified the fixed income revenue streams with its corporate trading technology enabled capability and so but that business thrives on volatility in this past quarter spread and the rate volatility wasnt as significant so they didnt have sort of the uplift that they had in the preceding quarters devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities okay terrific ill just leave it there in the interest of time here and follow up offline but thanks very much appreciate it paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator at this time i would like to hand the conference back to paul reilly for any additional or closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc great we appreciate you all coming on and good quarter already on to the next quarter and i think weve got some good tailwind so we look forward to it and im not sure i look forward to hearing all these generational comments about how old i am and how ready paul is but he is ready and so i think youre going to see a lot of good things from raymond james so thanks for joining us today raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript
