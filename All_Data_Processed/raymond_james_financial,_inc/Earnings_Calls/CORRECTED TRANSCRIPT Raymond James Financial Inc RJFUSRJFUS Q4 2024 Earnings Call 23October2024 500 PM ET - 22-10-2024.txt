concluding another fiscal year with outstanding achievements in fiscal we generated record net revenues and record net income showcasing the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses we ended the year with record client assets healthy pipelines for growth across our business and ample funding to support the balance sheet we remain well positioned to continue to invest in our business our people and technology to help drive growth across all of our businesses beginning on slide the firm reported record fiscal fourth quarter net revenues of billion net income available to common shareholders of million and earnings per diluted share of excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share we generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of a great result particularly given our strong capital base during the fiscal quarter we repurchased million shares of common stock for million bringing our fiscal year total to million shares for million at an average price of per share in total we returned nearly billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in the fiscal year moving to slide client assets grew to record levels this quarter driven by rising equity markets and solid advisor retention and recruiting in the private client group total assets under administration increased sequentially to trillion private client group assets and feebased accounts grew to billion and financial assets under management to billion domestic net new assets during the quarter were billion representing a annualized growth rate on beginning of the period domestic pcg assets and for the fiscal year domestic net new assets were billion representing a growth rate on beginning of the period domestic private client group assets a key contributor to the net new asset growth is our continued recruiting results which were really strong this quarter to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels we recruited financial advisors with approximately million of trailing 12month production and billion of client assets at their previous firms including assets recruited into our growing ria custody services division which we refer to as rcs we recruited across all platforms total client assets during the quarter of billion surpassing the previous best quarter which occurred in in terms of recruited assets for the fiscal year we recruited financial advisors with approximately million of trailing 12month production and billion of client assets at the previous firms recruiting in the year production and assets equaled to that of a pretty goodsized firm rcs asset growth is bolstered by both external joins as well as from internal transfers and rcs finished the quarter with billion of client assets under administration up over the prior year level this quarter we reported financial advisers of overall these fantastic recruiting results reflect the continuous focus of the entire firm to ensure raymond james remains a destination of choice for advisors as we had mentioned in previous quarters there are a couple of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 osj relationships in our independent contractor division who had decided to leave the platform it takes time to affect these movements but a portion of those assets left the firm in the fiscal fourth quarter totaling roughly billion of aua we anticipate approximately billion of assets associated with these firms to complete their transfers off the platform in early fiscal adjusting for these transferred assets net new assets growth in the quarter would have been approximately overall we remain focused on serving advisors across our multiple affiliation options our robust technology capabilities and clientfirst values continue to enable us to retain and attract highquality advisors total client domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up over june of bank loans grew at over the preceding quarter to a record billion primarily due to higher securitiesbased loans which grew in the quarter as well as continued residential mortgage growth moving to slide private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear results were bolstered by higher pcg assets under administration due to a strong equity market and net new assets brought into the firm reflecting positive results from our longterm focus and patience to hold the course in our capital markets businesses generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax income of million net revenues grew yearoveryear and sequentially driven primarily by higher ma revenues as the market environment became more supportive of transaction closings in the quarter market conditions seem to be improving and we are optimistic about our healthy pipeline and new business activity in ma the asset management segment generated record pretax income of million on record net revenues of million results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows in pcg feebased accounts as well as modest net inflows into raymond james investment management the bank segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million bank segment net interest income increased due in part to higher loan balances the net interest margin for the segment of declined basis points compared to the preceding quarter looking at the fiscal year results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record net income available to common shareholders of billion up and respectively over the record set in the prior year additionally we generated strong returns on common equity of and adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the year on slide the record results in pcg and asset management segments for the fiscal year primarily reflected a strong organic growth in pcg along with robust equity markets now ill turn the call over to our new cfo butch oorlog to review our financial results in detail butch butch oorlog chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul turning to slide consolidated net revenues were a record billion in the fourth quarter up over the prior year and up sequentially asset management and related administrative fees grew to billion representing growth over the prior year and over the preceding quarter this quarter pcg domestic feebased assets increased which will be an approximate tailwind for asset management and raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter brokerage revenues of million grew yearoveryear primarily due to higher brokerage revenues in pcg and fixed income capital markets ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million increased year overyear and sequentially fourth quarter results benefited from a significant increase in ma revenues moving to slide client domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets so far in the fiscal first quarter domestic cash sweep balances have declined about billion attributable to record quarterly fee billings turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks were million up over the preceding quarter the bank segment net interest margin was down basis points to for the quarter while the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks decreased basis points to primarily due to the fed rate cut based on current rates and balances which reflects the september rate cut and the impact of quarterly fee billings we would expect the aggregate of nii and rjbdp thirdparty fees to be down approximately in the fiscal first quarter keep in mind there are a lot of variables that could impact that estimate including further rate actions which are not assumed turning to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was excluding acquisitionrelated compensation expenses the adjusted compensation ratio was noncompensation expenses of million increased sequentially largely due to the bank loan provision for credit losses which was a benefit in the preceding quarter for the fiscal year noncompensation expenses excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses unexpected legal and regulatory items and nongaap adjustments presented in our nongaap financial measures came in just under our expectation of billion while we maintain discipline in controlling our expenses we continue to invest to support growth across the business slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters this quarter we generated a pretax margin of an adjusted pretax margin of an increase over the prior quarter arising in part from the improved capital markets results on slide at quarter end our total assets were billion a sequential increase largely due to loan growth and higher cash balances primarily held in our bank segment liquidity and capital each remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target with a tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of we remain well capitalized our capital levels provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate was for the quarter primarily reflecting the favorable impact of nontaxable valuation gains associated with the corporate owned life insurance portfolio slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share for the fiscal year we repurchased million shares for million as paul noted earlier in total we returned capital to shareholders of approximately billion during the fiscal year through dividends and share repurchases as of october approximately million remained under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization going forward we expect to continue to offset sharebased compensation dilution and to be raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 opportunistic with incremental share repurchases given our present capital and liquidity levels we currently expect to keep a similar pace of buyback activity as we did during this quarter or possibly more as we remain committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains solid nonperforming assets remained low and relatively unchanged from the prior quarter level at basis points of bank assets criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at up from in the preceding quarter primarily due to a small number of idiosyncratic loan downgrades the bank allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter roughly unchanged from the prior quarter level at just under the allowance percentage has trended lower largely due to a loan mix shift toward more securitiesbased loans and residential mortgages which carry lower allowance levels and now account for and of the total loan portfolio balances respectively the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was largely unchanged from the preceding quarter at approximately at quarter end we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios now ill turn the call over to paul shoukry to discuss our outlook paul paul m shoukry president director raymond james financial inc thank you butch you definitely covered the financials a lot better than i did when i was the cfo great job now on to our outlook we are pleased with our record results this quarter and for the fiscal year more importantly we are well positioned entering fiscal with record client asset levels healthy pipelines for growth across the business and ample capital and funding to support balance sheet growth in the private client group next quarters results will be positively impacted by the sequential increase of assets and feebased accounts which we expect will benefit asset management and related fees by approximately our advisor recruiting activity remains robust and were encouraged by the number of large teams joining us and remaining in the pipeline we are focused on being a destination of choice for current and prospective advisors which we believe over the long term should continue to drive industryleading growth in the capital markets segment we were pleased to see significantly improved results this quarter as the market environment became more constructive for investment banking results and particularly ma our ma pipeline remains healthy and we are optimistic that the consistent investments in our platform and people should continue to drive growth in fiscal and in the fixed income business the market is still challenging but weve begun to see some improvement in the depository sector of our business with shortterm rates decreasing and the yield curve steepening depository clients are starting to be more engaged in managing their securities portfolio overall despite the headwinds over the past two years we believe our longterm patient approach along with opportunistic investments weve made have well positioned us for growth as the market and rate environment become more conducive for the capital markets segment in the asset management segment we remain confident that strong growth of assets and feebased accounts in the private client group will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 raymond james investment management to help drive further growth over time and while the entire industry has been challenged by high levels of redemption activity the record levels of sales in fiscal are a testament to our strong portfolio management and sales teams in the bank segment we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand we have seen securitiesbased loan demand increase as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates further supported by the recent fed rate cut corporate loan growth has been muted as new origination activity in the credits we target remain low but we will remain patient and we are confident that loan demand in this category will rebound as well with ample client cash balances and capital we are very well positioned to lend across the loan segments as activity increases within our conservative risk guidelines in addition to driving organic growth across our businesses we also remain focused on corporate development efforts while we prefer to deploy capital to invest in growth we plan to maintain this past quarters pace of buybacks or potentially increase it as we continue to look for opportunities that may meet our disciplined ma parameters i want to quickly touch on shortterm rates because all too often lower interest rates are viewed as a negative for our business i would just say that there are a lot of potential positive outcomes as well two potential examples are higher loan growth and better investment banking results across the industry both which have been really low over the past couple of years again this reinforces the value of having diversified and complementary businesses in closing we are well positioned entering fiscal with strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and solid capital and liquidity to invest in future growth i want to thank our advisors and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients i also want to thank our fantastic leadership team many who took on larger roles starting on october as part of our longterm ceo succession process i really look forward to partnering even more closely with all of our leaders and associates for many years to come and of course i want to thank paul reilly for developing this strong team over the past years what is reinforced in the most challenging of times including with the two 100year hurricanes that hit us in a two week period is that we have something really special here at raymond james and my number one job when i take over as ceo is to do everything we possibly can to fiercely protect our culture and values that concludes our prepared remarks operator will you please open the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of michael cho with jpmorgan please go ahead michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good evening team thanks for taking my question my first question i just wanted to touch on the capital markets segment here i apologize in advance of its a twoparter but clearly a nice pickup as you noted in the advisory segment can you give any color or anything incremental in terms of maybe what you saw in the quarter or what and if theres anything particularly that drove the quarterly results in advisory and maybe anything more on the pipeline as you look ahead as well and then secondly paul as youve kind of talked through you invested in people and platform in this business over the last number of years and so when we think about operating leverage ahead i mean is there a way to frame the incremental margins ahead maybe relative to maybe what youve achieved in prior environments of better capital markets activity paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well first i think the whole market has pretty much shown an improving ma environment and i think its rate expectation and frankly a lot of capital on the sidelines so we had a big pickup this quarter but were seeing that both in activity in this current quarter coming up so a lot of bigger transactions a lot of people whove been on the sidelines that have reached deals to close them so in terms of activity we can we could go by number of mds wed have to speculate what the number what the rate is certainly i think weve had a year a couple of years ago thats hard to beat the benchmark because of this exceptional year but weve got room to grow from here and i wouldnt really put a number on it yet but weve got a lot of productive capacity michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah as far as the margin goes the margin portion of your question for the year is and thats a pretty healthy margin given the mix of businesses that were in now capital markets really wasnt hitting on all cylinders until this past quarters final quarter of the fiscal year but as we have puts and takes in our businesses so id say over time our goal has always been to grow revenues faster than expenses and therefore grow earnings and margins beyond that but in any one quarter any one year there could be a lot of puts and takes in our various businesses michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay wonderful thank you and then just a quick followup on the balance sheet i know you had a willingness for there is a willingness just to ultimately grow the balance sheet and youve called out that corporate loan raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 growth particularly has been somewhat tepid just curious what youre hearing from clients and what ultimately drives more demand here if its really just simply lower rates or if youre hearing anything else in terms of that piece of business thank you paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah on the corporate side lower rates would certainly help as companies take advantage of the debt that they could get at more attractive rates but also going back to your last question to paul ma activity historically has been a big driver of financing needs and so as we start seeing ma activity pick up hopefully that will be a leading indicator for corporate loan demand over time michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc good evening thanks for taking my question im curious on your outlook for next year with the noncomp expense you came in slightly below the billion for fiscal could you talk about the areas of investment and maybe quantify growth in that noncomp as you think about the next months paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc a lot of our noncomp items as weve said in the past is really growthrelated so investment subadvisory fees for example that grows with feebased assets which have been growing really nicely sequentially as an example and then the other expenses were going to continue to invest heavily in technology if you look at it on a percentage basis thats been our biggest grower consistently yearin and yearout and on an absolute dollar basis for that matter and thats really to remain competitive and provide advisors the very best technology that we can very competitive in the industry to help them find time and serve their clients more efficiently and effectively and so technology will continue to be a area of focus and then of course as you grow as an organization and grow the businesses youre going to need to grow the branch and office space and other aspects of noncomp to invest in the business daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood and then the comments around the backlog for advisors sounded pretty similar to what weve heard from previous quarters i was hoping to get a little more context maybe around numbers for retention in the period and then i think the larger books of business coming onboard maybe talk about the size today that youre recruiting average size versus say a year ago raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that both of those are up is that the biggest change probably over the last few years is a fewer advisors in total but much much bigger book so not only was this year an onboarding of probably the most largest books we ever have but also the same in the pipeline so weve become a destination for very large teams i think both because of our technology platform and our high net worth offerings over the last couple of years that weve developed have really taken off and made us a destination so were very comfortable not only do we have a very good recruiting year but were very comfortable with the backlog thats in there too daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with citizens jmp please go ahead devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc thanks so much hi paul paul and welcome butch paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc first question just on coming back to the balance sheet just lending capacity as demand picks up here so you have obviously plenty of capital you seem to be holding at least a couple billion dollars of excess liquidity on the balance sheet and then i think you have billion of cash at thirdparty bank so appreciate this isnt going to happen overnight and youre not going to force the lending but how you would frame the amount of loan growth that could come from just remixing the current balance sheet and then how much of that thirdparty cash you guys are comfortable moving on to the balance sheet over time with the assumption that deposits are stabilizing to maybe starting to grow a bit here paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well devin you answered the question just by giving the stats we have a ton of cash in capital and i think that whats limited our growth is just weve been very consistent in our risk appetite and having low risk on the ci side of the portfolio and just the spreads and the demand havent been there theyre just i think a lot of that has been as paul talked about earlier because of lack of ma activity certainly the opportunities to lend at the spreads and the risk tolerances we like havent been there but were more than willing when that returns to invest in them so thats holding it back there on the other side the sbl loans as rates went way up and mortgages as rates went up it just cooled the appetite now that weve seen even after just a basis point drop weve seen a pick up on sbls right away i think people have gotten used to the rates and figured theyre going to be aroundish to stay and they are floating so if they the sbls if they go down the rates will go down and clients seem to be more active raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 so were waiting on the commercial side to see a riskreward in terms of spreads and the risk part we like and are comfortable with and on the client side for sbls and mortgages its really their appetite were here and ready and we have plenty of cash so were not trying to limit the bank growth seen over the years well have quarters where there weve had fairly sizable growth and then quarters where weve had none just based on really what we think that market risk appetite is devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc yeah thanks paul i appreciate that i guess where i was going was more that you have billion of third party cash you want to have some liquidity parameters there im sure for risk management purposes so like are you comfortable moving billion of that or billion of that like whats the threshold that we should be looking at i know theres been thresholds over time so just curious how you guys think about that and where youre comfortable paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah well i mean the major thing that drives that is we offer clients fdic insurance up to million through the multisweep program and so we want to make sure that we avail our clients to those thirdparty banks to maximize their fdic insurance not a lot of other firms do that anymore especially firms with affiliated banks and so we think its important to protect to give that client that type of protection and so that would limit all billion for example to being deployed in our own bank probably would limit half of that i would say something in that range from being deployed to our own bank to give the clients the fdic insurance that they could get through the multisweep program devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc got it okay thats great color thanks paul and then followup id love to ask about fixed income brokerage i think performing reasonably in an environment thats been challenged i think you guys highlighted starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel with depository clients so just trying to think about where we could go from here if theres kind of a framing of whether its historical levels of revenue or how we should think about like how maybe much that part of the business is underpunching relative to its potential if liquidity builds in the system and banks are more active like just where that could go relative to where we currently are paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc i would say the periods during covid with very low rates those were kind of record levels for fixed income brokerage and that was a perfect environment for that business there was lots of excess cash in the system theres shortterm rates were close to zero and there is benefit for taking on some duration and so somewhere between kind of where weve been running in the last couple of years and covid is probably a reasonable place to kind of think a healthy level would be over time and then of course as we grow the business and we take market share and we grow tangential opportunities like sumridge has been a great addition beyond the depository spaces that diversifies and further strengthens our business as well so well continue to look to add to our capabilities and also our balance sheet is getting bigger so over time well also use our balance sheet in a very prudent way to continue supporting that business as well raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 so its still a growth business for us over time but just from the pure depository space the covid period was sort of the components of that business were sort of perfectly aligned devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc yeah got it okay thats helpful i appreciate you taking all the questions operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my questions so wanted to ask about advisory so its one of the themes weve been noticing and has been sort of nagging has been that sponsors have been sort of slow to reengage but i know your advisory business has a lot of leverage there and certainly encouraging to see that strength so hoping you could get maybe a little more color around what youre seeing is this a good sign that sponsors are beginning to reengage in the midmarket space or were there some lumpy results that benefited the revenues paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think theres a general reengagement so and across a lot of sectors so its a sign its weve always been i guess pretty conservative on our outlook there any time weve talked weve talked about a backlog but the market wasnt conducive were seeing people engage in and its not only on inventory i mean existing things that were up for being sold but were seeing new engagement and discussions about new mandates so we think im not going to say its going to boom overnight but were seeing a much more conducive market both in interest on buyers and sellers so at least for the near term we see a fairly good market and recovering market but i dont know if we can give you more color because one quarter doesnt always paint a longterm trend but we can tell you that the backlog looks pretty good for this for the near term anyway brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thats fair thanks thanks for that paul and then esp given where the yields were on that product i would expect that in the recent fed cut that had a very high beta should we just assume that thats a roughly 100beta product as we see cuts and have you noticed any change in behavior or engagement since yields have started to come down around that offering paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah i would say esp balances are higher yielding balances sort of at the same rate range as money market funds so that is typically a deposit beta type product and we have others we have balances and opportunities and certain balances at the in the bank segment as well in total when you look at our total balances at the bank side deposits to the bank segment and the sweep balances roughly half of our of those balances are highest higher rate higher deposit beta type balances raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 so we have a lot of protection to downside rates which is a which would give us some offsets with as rates decrease because obviously our floating our assets are mostly floating rate assets now what was the other part of the question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc any changes in engagement with those higher yield products as weve seen rates come down paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc not really there i think a lot of the cash reinvestment activity we saw are slowing down and decelerating well before the rate decrease and so we havent seen sort of an acceleration or deceleration frankly thats notable following the decrease brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good evening paul and good evening butch wanted to start with a question just on the spread revenue guide for next quarter the growth in sweep deposits was encouraging even inclusive of the fee billings just wanted to drill down into some of the inputs that are underpinning that lower spread revenue guide maybe more specifically just what deposit pricing changes are embedded in the guide and does it contemplate any favorable cash seasonality which we typically see around yearend paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah i mean weve been accused of being conservative with our guidance in the past particularly on this guidance so hopefully that proves to be the case this time around because loan balances are continuing to grow were not really factoring in ongoing loan balance this was more of a snapshot type view in terms of what the full run rate of rate changes would be to both the bdp fees and nii and so to your point balances can increase throughout the quarter whether it be cash balances but hopefully more loan balances and that could offset some of the reduction in rate and the sensitivity of that and i just gave you the breakout of the deposits that are higher yielding and higher deposit beta versus the ones that are lower yielding lower deposit beta and so thats kind of what went into our math steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and for a followup just on wanted to drill down into some of the earlier comments you made on net new asset growth and the pipeline for both you and industry peers this past year we did see the moderation in industry flow trends i understand you struck a positive tone in terms of the pipeline of new advisors but just trying raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 to gauge what drove the slowdown in industry growth whether we should interpret the comments on the pipeline as supportive of an acceleration in that flow rate and which channels are seeing the fastest growth across the platform given the omnichannel offering paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc it depends on how you want to look at it in our ria part rcs its by far the highest percentage growth and as consistent with industry trends thats been growing quickly if you look at total dollars and this goes back and forth a couple of years ago it was independent this year the employee channel really led the way and its we used to have well that independents grow faster than down markets i mean in up markets and employees in slow markets we dont see that trend anymore its really just where we can meet the teams that like an affiliation option and so employee led the way i actually think that well get some improvement in the independent contractor model because its just cyclical and the employee size has seems to have a very good backlog as was rcs so were encouraged but its a process both to get people to commit and get people in the door so we can never predict the timing but were encouraged even with the great results that we could do better so steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi guys good afternoon and butch welcome to the call as well i wanted to followup to stevens question around cash trends is it possible to unpack sort of sources of growth you saw in the third quarter your fiscal fourth quarter across the cash stack and curious whether it is really kind of abating of the sorting or are you starting to see more cash coming on to the sidelines as net new assets coming in paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc i mean we continue to grow a lot as a business and as we grow and bring on new advisors they bring on their clients theyre going to bring on their clients cash balance and so and thats been happening throughout the last couple of years its just been masked by the fact that theres been a lot of reinvestment activity and so as that reinvestment activity decelerates and subsides then youre going to start seeing the pure the growth coming in from the addition of advisors and their clients alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah that makes sense so your point is kind of like look from this point on like your cash balances are likely to grow and trend more in line with net new assets like weve seen in the past paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 well you took my comments a couple of steps further but im not sure were willing to declare a total end to the cash reinvestment but thats the dynamic that youve seen over the last id call four to six quarters was that dynamic has decelerated alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you okay good enough thanks and then a quick followup on the buyback i just want to make sure im interpreting your comments correctly so million share repurchases this quarter a nice step up should we assume that to be kind of run rate quarterly pace of buybacks from here as well or absent obviously like ma or anything like that and if there are opportunities to do more youre likely to do that as well im just trying to understand what the criteria are from here for trajectory of share repurchases paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc i mean to your point wed much rather use the capital to grow the business whether its through organic growth acquisitions or balance sheet growth with loan growth and we are optimistic on those fronts as well but to the extent that were not using the capital and were generating a pretty good earnings then we want to make sure that we limit further expansion of the capital ratio and thats where we come up with the sort of pace that weve been at here for the last quarter or maybe even a little bit more depending on all those factors and price and other things that we want to show our commitment to limiting further capital ratio growth given how strong it is now and its over our target of alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah makes perfect sense all right thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of bill katz with td cowen please go ahead bill katz q analyst td cowen this evening just coming back to the margin discussion excuse me just wondering if you could unpack a little bit from the topdown view of driving operating leverage to maybe the segment lines so if i look at each maybe the private client business and the capital markets business in particular the margins there improved reasonably strongly particularly in capital markets so how do we think about the marginal margin in those segments and then coming back paul to your comment paul shoukry to your comments of margin is pretty fulsome at this point so how do we think about the incremental margin at segment level and then that sort of translating into the overall margin outlook for holdco thank you paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc how many more hours do you have tonight yeah i mean i think listen to the extent that revenues grow in our segments then that should result in margin expansion for each one of our segments interest rates and spreads have a big play a big role in that both with the private client group segment and the bank segment and we raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 just had a basis point reduction i think we can over time offset that impact by growing the balance sheet at the bank as loan demand comes back so over time i think we can do that and then to the extent capital markets margin improved this past quarter but it hasnt been exactly great the first three quarters of the fiscal year so the incremental margin when youre operating at a loss is pretty significant especially with the significant revenue increase we had in the segment this quarter so im just saying over time what i cautioned the street from doing is just assuming that the margin gets better in every segment because everything goes in the right direction and then that generates a substantially higher margin than we generated this year i think thats maybe not factoring in the puts and takes that are natural in our diverse and complementary businesses bill katz q analyst td cowen okay thats helpful and then just one followup just coming back to client cash for a moment sort of seeing this with some of your peers youve seen a big pickup in client cash into the end of the quarter and some have pointed to just some fixed income liquidity maturities coming in some uncertainty around interest rate expectations given some of the moves by the fed and obviously election coming up in just a couple weeks from now so are you seeing a structural shift in the client cash or is this more of a timing element on asset allocation that is somewhat plumping up client cash all else being equal and it could sort of move back into more sort of aum type of levels and not so much on the nii side thank you paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc i would say our asset mix has been remarkably consistent advisors have been doing a very good job through different cycles both market cycles and rate cycles keeping clients asset mix relatively aligned with their long term investment objectives and so like for example equities for us right now is roughly on an exrate basis of assets and thats been consistent within percentage points or percentage points for the last several years in various environments and so the mix shift that youve seen over the last five years has really been within the cash category when its a low rate environment theres more in transactional cash and when youre in a higher rate environment theres more investable cash there and so thats the only shift i think weve seen over the long term and one quarter the difference i think in just the last couple of quarters is the deceleration i talked about of the sorting activity and now youre starting to see more of that growth coming in from just bringing on advisors as they bring on their clients and existing advisors bring on new clients bill katz q analyst td cowen okay thank you for the perspective and taking the questions operator your next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 good evening paul you noted a continued focus on corporate development efforts and remaining disciplined there just curious if you can give us an update on the ma environment are you seeing more or less opportunities today compared to earlier in is the rate certainty helping to narrow bidask spreads for potential targets and any areas of focus we should really be thinking about in terms of the wealth segment or are there other areas youre considering for inorganic growth paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we look across all of our businesses for growth we really believe were positioned for the right opportunities to grow and id say our corporate development team has done a great job of bringing opportunities to us right so we look at a lot of deals some we just dont like the deals the way they fit in our environment some are not culturally there and some we like and we just cant get to terms on what we think is good longterm price so were constantly looking we take them very seriously were as you know a conservative buyer and that will be competitive but we wont stretch way out to buy an asset and so it really just depends when they click and thats the hard thing on timing like a few years ago people say well you guys arent going to buy anything youre hoarding all this capital and we closed four deals in the next few months i mean it just took a while and they just all happened to hit around the same time so were still in that mode but were not going to do a deal just to do a deal it has to be something that fits and makes sense for the firm and shareholders kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc makes sense and for my followup maybe just a question on the balance sheet on the afs portfolio i know that continued to run off in the quarter i guess with some more clarity on the rate environment in terms of the direction of travel with the fed and still with significant excess capital is there any desire to change your stance on that and begin holding that steady or growing those balances in fiscal or do you anticipate letting that portfolio continuing to run off paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah we let that portfolio grow modestly just really to accommodate client cash balances when the banks during the covid period didnt really want those balances and so now all were doing is getting back to sort of a normalized liquidity level at both banks and primarily at raymond james bank where we were accommodating those balances so once they get to that normal state then well maintain the balance for the securities portfolio banks typically need to run at maybe around a to liquidity ratio between cash and securities and so raymond james bank is still well above that and so well let those securities run off and then once they get to that type of range then well maintain the balances but the point is were not taking bets on duration were not taking bets on where the fed may or may not take rates that got a lot of our peers in trouble and so we want to just stay focused on serving clients and keeping the balance sheet as flexible as possible for anything that the market or the interest rate environment may bring us kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 thank you operator and your next question comes from line of michael cyprys with morgan stanley please go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking the question wanted to ask about the pcg business indiscernible operate on how thats performing and contributing across canada and the uk today i know youve done some acquisitions there over the years just curious what youre seeing in terms of organic growth contribution over the past year versus say fiscal and then canada and the uk maybe you could talk a little about some of the initiatives there to accelerate organic growth and improve scale and profitability paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc its a little bit of a tale of two cities for different reasons but the private client group in canada is doing great growth in recruiting when we acquired that business it was really a capital markets business and with the small pcg business and today its a very strong like similar to the us really a big capital private client group base continuing to recruit similar profit margins good growth same kind of platforms that we have here in the us where you have advisors choice and they executed very very well to where were really getting to the size of the smallest of the largest banks which is quite unusual in canada but we are up there we feel like a canadian firm and they just have a us parent but they operate very very well the uk because weve done a recent acquisition are still an integration the growth has been kind of flat in that as we get people and systems and everything really hooked together and going through that integration process the growth is much slower but we anticipate once were able to do that and get the integration we expect to be able to grow there but its a smaller business too so wont have as long wont have as big of an impact consolidated michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks and just on the rcs business maybe you could help remind us just in terms of the economics there how that compares to your traditional channel say for billion of assets just maybe you can walk us through the pl impact across revenue indiscernible thanks paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah what weve disclosed so far so maybe its something we cover at analyst day or something we havent really disclosed in detail but we really get an asset fee there so if you looked at pure ria the way they measure margins they are higher margins if you look at our net on basis points on assets are lower so part of it the service model is different too you dont have all the supervision and compliance requirements that an raa has those responsibilities or certain things that they do they are clients of ours their clients are their clients they are not our clients and outside of some aml responsibilities and just oversight to make sure they have process theres a lot less cost that goes into it although were a higher service model so its not easy to give a quick answer but it might be something that we can show in more detail at maybe the next analyst day raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc just any sense ballpark directionally pbt margin revenue roca just how to think about that versus the firm or versus a indiscernible paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc yeah its complicated again as paul said the analystinvestor day would be a good time to talk about the margin on a pl basis is actually higher because the attachment revenue that you book is much lower whereas in our other businesses we gross up the revenues prepay out and then the roca just varies dramatically depending on the asset mix that the ria has and the pricing structure because theres different pricing structures depending on the ria as well so we can get probably more time than we have now to discuss but analystinvestor day is probably the right forum for that michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great look forward to that thank you paul m shoukry a president director raymond james financial inc thank you paul c reilly chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well great we appreciate everybodys attendance and were very proud of the quarter but were already working on the next quarter because thats just what we do here and butch has done a great job and weve had a great transition and well continue to do that over the next year so
