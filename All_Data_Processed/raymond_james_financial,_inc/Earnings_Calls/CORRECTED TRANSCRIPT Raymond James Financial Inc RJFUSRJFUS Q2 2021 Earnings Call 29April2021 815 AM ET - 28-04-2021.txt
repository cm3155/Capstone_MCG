executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you kristie and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today it has been a year since the financial markets bottomed and the federal reserve cut shortterm interest rates to near zero that move reduced our pretax run rate by the stock market has seen an incredible run since with the sp up yearoveryear while that tailwind has certainly helped fuel our strong results the records we generated during the quarter and first half of the fiscal year have also been driven by our unwavering commitment to providing excellent service to advisors and their clients during this difficult and unprecedented time its a testament to our advisors who have shepherded their clients through the pandemic and the wherewithal of our associates who have worked so hard to service our advisors and their clients our strong balance sheet and our ability to grow both in constructive and challenging markets certainly a year we will never forget on many levels starting on slide the fiscal second quarter was another record quarter the firm reported record net revenues of billion which were up over the prior years fiscal second quarter and over the preceding quarter record net income of million or per diluted share increased over net income in the year ago quarter and over the preceding quarter annualized return on equity for the quarter was and return on tangible common equity was an extremely impressive result especially in this nearzero rate environment and given our strong capital position record quarterly revenues were primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees investment banking revenues and record brokerage revenues which more than offset the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates on both the net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks record quarterly net income was attributable to the record revenues disciplined management of controllable expenses the bank loan loss benefit of million reflecting improving economic conditions and subdued business development expenses given the lack of business travel and conferences moving to slide we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of trillion which were up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially we also achieved records for pcg assets in fee based accounts of billion a sequential improvement which will benefit the third quarter and financial assets under management of billion we ended the quarter with a record financial advisors a net increase of over the prior years period and over the preceding quarter this represents a solid improvement over the prior quarter and reflects our strong retention and the continued strength of our recruiting pipelines across all of our affiliation options our recruiting momentum in the independent side of the business continues to be strong on the employee side as we mentioned last quarter in response to the increased recruiting packages by competitors we enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders and while recruiting momentum in this business has increased greatly employee advisory count is down slightly from the prior quarter as improved recruiting was offset by a higher number of retirements raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 where assets are typically retained at the firm as well as the smaller training class however the number of advisors scheduled to join is up significantly not only in our employee channel but across all of our affiliation options looking at our recruiting results over the prior four quarters financial advisors with approximately million of trailing months production and nearly billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with raymond james domestically as for our net organic growth results in the private client group we generated domestic pcg net new assets of nearly billion over the four quarters ending in march representing more than a of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the period and remember this is net of client fees and this trend has accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year closer to a annualized rate we are very pleased with our consistent organic growth especially given the disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic during the year now lets move to the segment results on slide the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million and pretax margin reflecting significant operating leverage despite being in a nearzero rate environment quarterly net revenues grew over the preceding quarter predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting higher assets in feebased accounts which will continue to be a tailwind in the third quarter higher brokerage revenues also contributed to the quarterly revenue growth the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million driven by record brokerage revenue record equity underwriting and strong ma revenues despite not topping the extra ordinarily strong and recordbreaking first quarter results the results this quarter were very strong driven by broadbased strength across global equities and investment banking and fixed income businesses the strong results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last years and we are continuing to make investments including the recent acquisition of the consumerfocused ma advisory firm financo which closed at the end of the quarter and we welcome financo to the raymond james family the asset management segment generated record net revenues of million and record pretax income of million record results were primarily due to growth of financial assets under management driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into feebased accounts in the private client group carillon tower advisers also generated significant net inflows during the quarter lastly raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million quarterly net revenues declined compared to a year ago quarter primarily due to the impact of lower shortterm interest rates sequentially quarterly net revenues declined as higher asset balances were offset by the expected basis points decline in the banks net interest margin during the quarter which was also largely attributable to the agencybacked securities portfolio pretax income growth was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to the provision for credit losses in both of the comparative periods the credit quality of the banks portfolio remains healthy as paul shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks looking at the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion during the first six months of the fiscal up over the same period record earnings per diluted share of increased compared to the first six months of fiscal primarily due to the revenue growth along with the loan loss reserve release compared to the provision for credit losses in the comparative period raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 moving to the fiscal yeartodate results on slide the private client group capital markets and asset management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first six months of the fiscal year in fact capital markets segments pretax income for the first half of the fiscal year of million actually exceeded the annual record of million set in fiscal again these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses and now for a more detailed review of the financial results ill turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul ill begin with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially as expected asset management fees grew sequentially a bit lower than the growth of feebased assets during the preceding quarter primarily due to two fewer billable days during the quarter private client group assets in feebased accounts were up during the fiscal second quarter providing a tailwind for this line item for the third quarter of fiscal consolidated brokerage revenues of million grew over the prior year and represent a record driven by continued strength in institutional fixed income as well as strong brokerage revenues in the private client group reflecting healthy client activity levels and higher asset values accounting service fees of million declined yearoveryear almost entirely due to the decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks given lower short term interest rates which i will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next two slides the sequential increase was largely attributable to higher asset balances and revenues from our recent acquisition of nwps most of which are reflected in the client account and other fees line in the pcg segment consolidated investment banking revenues of million grew yearoveryear driven by strong ma advisory revenues and record equity underwriting revenues for the first half of the year investment banking revenues were higher than the first half of fiscal our investment banking pipelines remain strong so we would be really pleased to finish the fiscal year averaging million or better of investment banking revenues per quarter if market conditions remain conducive other revenues of million are down sequentially primarily due to lower private equity valuation gains during the quarter partially offset by a strong quarter for the tax credit funds business moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for interest earning assets and the balances with thirdparty banks that generate rjbdp fees ended with a quarter end record of billion increasing sequentially and representing of domestic pcg client assets as we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from thirdparty banks more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer you can see those balances grew to billion and most of that growth has been used to purchase shortterm treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement over time that cash could be redeployed to our bank or thirdparty banks as capacity becomes available which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on shortterm treasuries on slide the top chart displays our firmwide net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by change in shortterm interest rates related we have updated the net interest margin or nim chart on the bottom left portion of this slide to show nim for both raymond james bank and the firm overall the combined net interest income and bdp fees from thirdparty banks declined a bit sequentially largely due to fewer days during the quarter and nim compression at the bank raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 as i mentioned on the last quarters call we would expect the banks nim to decline to around over the next two quarters as new agency security purchases have lower yield in the runoff but still represent a higher yield than we are earning from thirdparty banks or in shortterm treasuries we also believe the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks will remain close to basis points for the rest of the fiscal year but that could experience downward pressure in fiscal if banks demand for deposits doesnt improve from current levels moving to consolidated expenses on slide first compensation expense which is by far our largest expense as expected the compensation ratio increased sequentially from to largely due to the revenue mix shift towards higher compensable revenues in the pcg segment as financial advisor payouts particularly on the independent contractor side of the business where they cover most of their overhead costs are typically much higher than the associated compensation in the other businesses on a sequential basis the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the first calendar quarter of each year as we explained on the last call given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of or better in this near zero shortterm interest rate environment noncompensation expenses of million decreased compared to last years second quarter and sequentially primarily driven by the million bank loan loss benefit compared to provisions in the comparative periods business development expenses also remain subdued but we expect those to increase over the next few quarters as business travel picks back up and conferences and recognition trips resume overall you can see we have been really focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in fiscal second quarter of which was boosted by record revenues the loan loss reserve release and subdued business development expenses on the last call we talked about generating a to pretax margin in this near zero interest rate environment but as we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year theres meaningful upside to our margin when capital markets results are so strong on slide at the end of the quarter total assets were billion a sequential increase reflecting the dynamic i explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated segregated assets at the broker dealer as well as solid growth of corporate loans and securitybased loans at raymond james bank this balance sheet growth caused our tier leverage ratio to decrease to which is still well above the regulatory requirements and our more conservative target of liquidity remains very strong with billion of cash at the parent at the end of the quarter leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be defensive and opportunistic during the quarter we announced a debt offering which closed at the beginning of our fiscal third quarter so it was not reflected in any of the second quarters numbers to take advantage of the low rate environment we raised million of 30year senior notes at and utilize the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next two senior note maturities effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding but with a much longerterm stable funding profile in the third quarter we expect to record losses associated with the early extinguishment of these notes which should total somewhere around million to help with comparability well break those losses out as a non gaap adjustment in the fiscal third quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters in the second quarter we repurchased  for million an average price of approximately per share over the first two quarters of the fiscal year we repurchased shares for million and we remain committed to repurchasing a total of at least million in fiscal to offset sharebased compensation dilution as of april million remained under the current share repurchase authorization lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve nonperforming assets remained low at basis points of total assets however criticized loans increased due to a handful of credit downgrades within our reit portfolio particularly in the hospitality sector while all of those credits we downgraded continue to perform have large cash balances and are starting to see improvement in their portfolios we thought it was prudent to downgrade those credits we had net chargeoffs of million in the quarter which were related to opportunistic loan sales of million at nearly of par value the bank loan loss benefit of million was largely attributable to the macroeconomic inputs in the cecl model which reflect an improved outlook particularly for the commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan portfolios due to reserve releases and the loan growth during the quarter the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans declined from to at quarter end for the corporate loan portfolios these allowances are higher at around we believe we are adequately reserved but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate our strong balance sheet and longterm focus was recently cited as a strength by fitch ratings who launched its longterm senior unsecured rating for raymond james financial of a minus with a stable outlook now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you so overall a year into the global health pandemic with nearzero shortterm interest rates and during a quarter with lots of seasonal headwinds such as fewer billable days and the reset of payroll taxes i could not be more pleased with our record top and bottom line results this quarter as for our outlook we remained well positioned entering the third fiscal quarter with records for all of our key business metrics strong financial advisor recruiting activity and robust pipelines for investment banking in the private client group segment while the recruiting environment is competitive and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment our financial advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal third quarter with a sequential increase in assets in feebased accounts the enhancements we made to the recruiting packages on the employees side of the business have been very well received by prospective advisors and that pipeline has recovered nicely our prospective advisors across all of our affiliation options have continued to be attracted by our leading technology solutions we have been known for our industryleading position and mobile advisor tools and continue to make our technology platform more robust we have also created easytouse systems that put all the information advisors need right at their fingertips so they can easily get the information they need to service their clients and have more time taking care of their clients and growing their business raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 as we continue to invest in our technology were extremely excited about the new enhancements which will be coming out shortly we have been measuring our client satisfaction for the past years using net promoter scores and im proud to share that our client satisfaction has never been higher both in terms of satisfaction with raymond james as well as satisfaction with their advisors in the capital markets segment although there is still economic uncertainty due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic the investment banking pipeline remains strong and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated particularly in the depositary clients segment where we have a leadership position in the asset management segment results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as the equity markets remain resilient we were also pleased to see positive net flows for carillon tower advisers in the quarter despite the structural headwinds for active asset managers we hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of highquality active asset managers and raymond james banks should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securitiesbased loans and mortgages to the private client group segment on a yearoveryear basis the growth of the securitiesbased loans has been impressive around well also continue to be selective and deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio and the agencybacked securities portfolio as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet we continue to focus on longterm growth and our priorities remain unchanged our top priority is organic growth which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the private client group additionally we are continuing to add senior talent to all of our businesses we also continue to actively pursue acquisitions but we will still be deliberate and only pursue transactions that are a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders we have been even more proactive in sourcing and evaluating opportunities on earth day last week we released our first corporate responsibility report the report summarizes our foundational commitments to people sustainability community and governance and illustrates our longstanding approach to doing business rooted in our values and brought to life through our peopledriven culture this report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisors and associates across the firm do to contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment we look forward to building on this inaugural report by maintaining transparency and sharing progress over time with that operator can you please open the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you very much operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill katz with citigroup please go ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay good morning and thank you for taking my question so i guess the first one is i presume in more detail well follow up on the investor day next month but i was wondering if you could maybe provide a little more discussion or disclosure around the tier leverage ratio of maybe the timeline or the pathway and i guess this quarter with a very strong loan growth and so a stepped up buyback the blueprint that we should expect going forward paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey bill good morning and great question as you said we will discuss that in a lot more detail at the upcoming analystinvestor day and really the decline to this quarter was primarily attributable to the increase in client cash balances and were accommodating more of that on our balance sheet at the broker dealer frankly because the thirdparty bank demand with all of the banks flush with cash right now has declined at the broker dealer we are to fulfill the associated reserve requirement repurchasing shortterm are repurchasing short term treasuries and we hope that we can over time redeploy that into more profitable growth at the bank but in terms of how we think about getting the over time its really going to be a combination of growing the balance sheet which primarily occurs for us at raymond james bank as you know you alluded to the strong loan growth in the quarter of we are still being very deliberate in growing the portfolio both the private client group loans securitiesbased loans grew almost yearoveryear and mortgages have seen good growth as well although theres been a high degree of runoffs and refinancing there and were starting to really be deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio although there still continues to be more demand and supply in the market with banks being flushed with cash and then the second component of managing the capital ratio is really deploying the capital you saw us do the buybacks this quarter to offset the dilution well continue to do that and be opportunistic if the prices are at attractive levels and then of course you just heard paul mention the focus on acquisitions as well as another way to deploy capital william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you and just to follow up so coming back to the commentary that the organic growth accelerated in the sort of last couple of quarters to which is quite impressive wondering if you can maybe fill that back a little bit more and maybe talk to like the organic growth between the different channels and i think maybe a little more color around the recruitment backdrop thank you paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 id say in two levels yeah sure if you look at i know a lot of people record quarterly and semiannually so as you know we do annual so we thought wed give the indication that were approaching for the first six months which is a great number the growth has been kind of proportional to the channels were finding our advisors who are just bringing in assets and clients even in this market which theyve consistently done and the top producers have really had very impressive results in their growth so its happening everywhere and then on recruitment we measure we dont publish what we call commits and those are people saying im coming what you see are the people that sign so its like almost ma right youre in a transaction but we dont count until it closes its the same in recruiting but our commits are way up in every channel all of our channels and now some of those people may not join or they may delay the join which often will happen for just logistics reasons and it might slip into the next quarter but based on the backlog it is very very robust so i think we posted good numbers this quarter and my guess is in all channels youre going to see better numbers next quarter so operator our next question comes from manan gosalia morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning you had a pretty strong quarter for investment banking across the board can you give us some more color on the backlog i think you mentioned it remains strong but maybe you can compare it to the start of the fiscal second quarter and then your pretax margins in the capital markets division declined qonq it was a pretty strong revenue environment so i was wondering if there is any seasonality there or should we expect margins in that segment to stay at these levels in this kind of an environment for trading paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so let me start on kind of the revenue side ill let paul address the margin side a little bit because theres lots of moving parts in all of these on the revenue side honestly and paul talked about million plus were at record levels right so every time you have records you always wonder but if you look at the backlog you would see no reason why it would slow now again ma is one of those deals where economy can change people can pull out of deals so they can get delayed so youd never know but the backlog would say its as robust as ever the markets active i think for everyone and our backlog is very very strong and continuing to sign new deals even as of this last week that were pretty significant so we feel pretty good about the backlog paul you want to talk about the margin level paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean the margin certainly bounced around a little bit from quarter to quarter but at for the quarter thats still a fantastic margin for the capital markets segment and when you look yeartodate i think its so revenues were down a bit sequentially ma still had a very strong quarter but it was down from the record ma results last quarter and that is a high margin revenue source so again it could bounce around but at these levels were still really pleased with a margin yeartodate manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 great and then maybe on the loan growth side you saw some nice loan growth as you mentioned in the real estate and sbl portfolio this quarter are you doing anything differently there any change in underwriting given how much the macro environment has improved and with markets at alltime highs or is this just increased penetration of your existing customer base paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say its not relaxed underwriting so i think it is better processing and trying to get make it a smoother process the underwriting standards are the same as ever but i do think our advisors in this market and a lot of people as their estate and tax planning are using the tools so we are advertising to our advisors we dont go direct to their clients the availability and the use of these tools in financial planning but its their choice and their clients choice we dont market directly to the end client but given that and i think the educational process and the dynamics of the market weve had significant growth and still see that channel is very active so compared to our bigger peers we are in much lower penetration so we think theres more opportunity manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks a lot operator our next question is from devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning everyone paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey maybe start with one here just on the strength in private client brokerage revenues in the quarter i heard some of the commentary but itd be great just to get a little more color on what you guys are seeing in that business and if you can how much of the sequential improvement was from trailing commissions versus just activity and really what im trying to do is just parse through how much of that business is benefiting from a bigger base and higher assets versus maybe something that was a little bit unusually active in the backdrop paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin thats a great question there were really strong brokerage revenues in the private client group business a lot of that reflects the healthy level of client engagement just given the market opportunities when you look at that kind of million of brokerage revenues roughly of it is assetbased and the other is raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 transactionalbased and then it varies by line for example the mutual fund line to of that is asset based and so obviously that has grown nicely as assets have grown and the ph net trail commissions have grown as well but you can also see that the transactional commissions from equities etfs and fixed incomes theyre up sequentially as well so good level of client activity obviously the asset growth helps there as well there were some lumpy placement fees in that brokerage revenues in private client group this quarter but that happens from time to time but that certainly was another benefit during the quarter as well devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay thats really good color thanks paul and then maybe another kind of modeling question just thinking about the comp ratio moving parts i appreciate the mixed dynamics particularly as you have strong quarters in the independent brokerage channel and if you could put some upward pressure all else equal but then you also highlighted some of the seasonal items like payroll taxes so if we look at that basis point sequential increase im not sure if its youre able to kind of parse through how much is a drag from the seasonal peace or even if you can kind of quantify how much the payroll taxes affected the comp if im looking at like the other segment for example there was a million increase im sure you saw increases in any other pieces but its still a little bit tough to parse through that would be really helpful if you give any color there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah it is a great question devin and we try to parse through it ourselves theres a lot of moving parts there because theres also elevated payroll taxes with our yearend bonuses for those who havent hit the threshold so in the past weve said its been million or so sequentially in terms of the impact but i would tell you the comp ratio as i said on last quarters call really the biggest driver there was just the increase in compensable revenues in the private client group business that has an average payout between the employee and independent channel as you know of around and so we want those revenues to grow as much as possible obviously and theyre going to grow all else being equal in the third quarter because feebased revenues grew our assets grew during the quarter so thats going to be a tailwind to compensable revenues in the private client group business so it really is a mix issue more than anything else as we have really been focused on managing the controllable expense as much as we possibly can devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great ill leave it there thank you guys paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator our next question is from craig siegenthaler of credit suisse please go ahead gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc good morning this is gautam sawant filling in for craig can you please expand on the competition youre seeing within the employee and independent channel and how your transition assistance is positioned following raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 the increase and could you also speak to some of the additional differentiated technology in your platform relative to peers paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes so on the transition assistance it became clear as a number of firms not all had raised it significantly we were not even closed in the market and especially for large teams and so looking we knew we had room from a return standpoint so on those large teams i would say now when we come in to the finals were not the highest but were in the ballpark and so enough that people are saying theyre willing to make the trade for the dollars for the culture and the values when we had deals that literally were almost twice as much as ours it was hard for people to turn down the money even though they might have preferred coming here so we arent the highest we are competitive and we think its a fair package both and a good return for us so were feeling that were well positioned and appropriately positioned and i think its going to reflect in the numbers and a lot of very very high quality teams probably the largest number of large teams that weve had thats certainly in memory so which means theyre probably the largest group of large teams weve ever had in the recruiting pipeline im sorry and your second question was gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc if you can just expand on some of the differentiated technology in your platform relative to some of your peers paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so our focus for a long time had been on the advisors desktop weve had a lot of peers that focused on the end client desktop some because they were going direct to their end clients we first wanted to put all the capabilities into our advisors desktop so its been many years now since weve been completely mobile our advisors could do almost everything from their iphones that they could do from their desktop and making sure that our advisors had all the latest tools planning tools and completely mobile very very early on now not only we are enhancing those platforms but were bringing that same robust technology to those client connections we believe our client app is very good our sat scores are very high on our internal survey which we do every year but now were connecting all that power of those apps to their clients so that their integration is much closer as well as rolling out many things weve been on this journey for years and going from being having good technology to all of our recruits tell us from other firms as from an advisor desktop leading technology so that battle never ends people are always investing so youll see more of it on investor day we believe thats been one of the impetuses of our strong recruiting and one of the tradeoffs people have made for the packages its the culture and the tools and the support from a marketing department and all the other things we do to help advisors build their businesses operator operator instructions our next question is from steven chubak wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hi steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question just on the securities growth or at least your appetite to maybe grow the securities portfolio a bit more you cited the significant buildup in client cash that had clearly impacted the nim and was hoping you can just give some context as to what your appetite is to reaccelerate securities growth once again and paul you cited reinvestment headwinds versus the back book yield where are you reinvesting today just given some of the recent steepening in the curve paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey steve great question we have a significant appetite to grow the securities portfolio yeah unfortunately the supply and kind of shorter duration paper we have been buying trying to buy in that threeyear type duration average life range and the supply given the flat yield curve and where mortgages are being originated today and the longer end of the curve theres just not a lot of paper out there that gives you that threeyear average life and to the extent that you can find it is probably paying in the kind of 80basispoint range so we have been proactive in investing and growing that part of the portfolio the challenge is where most of the supply is youre having to go out years kind of years as on average life and you get paid more obviously youre going to get somewhere north of but youre certainly not getting paid enough to take any level of inflation risk over that fiveyear period for example and so were looking at it closely almost daily were looking at whats happening with spreads on the securities portfolio we have a lot of significant appetite to grow it over time but id tell you now with the fed buying as much as theyre buying particularly on the short end theres just not a lot i mean theres a whole lot more demand than supply and so were going to continue to be patient just as we always are paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc but weve also i think strategically in our ci portfolio grown and also look as alternatives of very high rated company paper with shorter duration buying loans in the secondary market where that duration is going to go out just a few years and its floating and we think better credit riskreturn so weve been trying to be flexible in growing it but weve waited a long time on a floating rate environment we dont want to lock in at the bottom so were watching duration very very closely steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for all that color and just for my followup on question just on the noncomps noncomps ex provision million was certainly better than what we were contemplating and its been running in a pretty tight band of about million to million i know that its certainly been helped by depressed business development expense but how should we be thinking about the right run rate from here assuming that thats going to remain relatively depressed and i guess as we start to prepare for some normalization in business how should we be thinking about the run rate in a more normal backdrop as well raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah great question and business development expense as i said on the opening remarks we do expect that to start increasing as travel is starting to pick up a bit maybe not so much in the third quarter but in the fourth quarter assuming the vaccines continue to prove effective we expect the travel and even conferences and recognition trips to pick back up before the covid pandemic we said that we were looking to average somewhere around million a quarter and if you add if you kind of normalize for business development and im not sure what normal is frankly when we do get back to normal it would get you right around that range so we have been really focused on managing all the controllable aspects of noncompensation expenses as you can see but also a lot of its growth driven i mean so subadvisory fees is going to grow with feebased assets over time we have fdic insurance premiums that grow with the banks balance sheet growth recruiting as paul said is picking up substantially theres going to be account transfer fees there so a lot of the noncomp expense growth as we are a growth company are intended to grow over time but we are focused on growing revenues at a faster rate than expenses over time as well so we do realize that operating leverage operator and our last question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a question on cash balances they keep growing we saw how active your clients were on the brokerage side but yet cash balances keep growing are we starting to see some leveling off or maybe even putting that to work recently or is it still sort of expect cash balances to keep growing paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc great question jim it seems like weve seen a leveling off to some extent some of the growth frankly in the last few months had been just coming from what used to be in purchase money market funds or other shortterm alternatives that are now because those alternatives arent generating any kind of yield theyre sitting in the cash sweep program but we have seen a little bit of a level off but those balances as we saw last year in march can change dramatically with market volatility or downward trend in the market so at of assets i would tell you clients are i think right now were looking at around exposure to equities which when you look historically clients are pretty engaged in the equity markets which is what you would want given the run that we had and a lot of the value that financial advisors provide is keeping clients consistent with their financial plans in periods like we had last year so for us we dont tend to see the exposure to the different asset segments that the ebrokers might see et cetera or the day traders might see we tend to stay a lot more consistent our clients tend to stay a lot more consistent as their advisors really keep them on their financial plans james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay thats helpful and maybe on carillon towers i think you guys noted significant inflows we havent seen that in a while just any more specifics on what the drivers were do you think that can continue just sort of any color there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 yeah it was around billion for the quarter of net inflows so that was a pretty i think annualized rate but unfortunately were not prepared to annualize that theres structural headwinds we had some nice institutional wins during the quarter and so we have invested in the distribution capability we recently announced a new leader for that business so itll be good to bring in a fresh set of eyes with a very experienced leader but still dealing with the headwinds so were not prepared to declare victory after one quarter of net inflows but it was certainly nice to see after several quarters of headwinds james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right okay thanks operator gentlemen those are all the questions i will turn it back over to you for closing remarks paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well thank you all we appreciate your time this morning i know its a busy earnings day but i think were well positioned weve
