of raymond james financial paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks kristie good morning everyone thanks for joining us during this call if you hear me refer to paul im not referring to myself in the third person because paul shoukry has now taken over the cfo reins and will be going over that part of the call as usual ill give an overview and im going to turn it over to paul who will cover more of the detail and update our guidance as we indicated on our last call before the interest rate changes we were going to hold off on guidance until those rate cuts were announced and we knew how deep they would be after that paul will then turn it over to me to discuss the outlook so overall im really pleased with our results for the first quarter especially given the significant headwinds from the three recent interest rate cuts which will have an estimated negative impact on our pretax earnings of approximately million annually as outlined on slide we generated quarterly net revenues of billion which were up from the prior years fiscal first quarter and down from the record set in the preceding quarter we generated record quarterly net income of million or per diluted share on an annualized basis our return on equity for the quarter was and while as you know weve been reluctant to disclose this metric because we believe return on total equity is the most relevant and we do not have any preferred equity we are now disclosing return on tangible common equity or rotce as that has become a common metric in our industry on an annualized basis we generated a return on tangible common equity during the quarter which we believe is very attractive especially given our strong capital position on slide you can see that in addition to the strong financial results this quarter we also achieved records for most of our key business metrics including client assets under administration of billion pcg assets in fee based accounts of billion financial assets under management of billion total pcg financial advisors of and net loans at rj bank of billion while equity market appreciation certainly contributed to the growth of client asset metrics we also believe that the substantial growth for example yearoveryear and sequential increases in pcg assets in feebased accounts reflect significant increases in market share that have been driven by our consistent industryleading strong retention and recruiting of private client group financial advisors for example for the firms that have already reported the yearoveryear increases in feebased assets have ranged to well below our yearoveryear growth clients domestic cash balances which ended the quarter at billion were down yearoveryear from the high watermark reached in the following in the quarter a year ago because of the surge in market volatility in december of but were up sequentially partially due to yearend tax planning positioning client cash balances appear to stabilize over the last several raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 months but remember at the beginning of each quarter we have the impact of quarterly fee billings and in the first calendar quarter we typically see seasonal declines in cash balances due to income tax payments now lets turn to the segment results starting on slide the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion primarily driven by the aforementioned growth of assets in feebased accounts which was partially offset by the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks quarterly net income for the segment was million down on a yearoveryear basis but up sequentially the yearoveryear declines in pretax income was largely due to the decrease in net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which was due to the lower shortterm interest rates as paul shoukry will discuss in much more detail the sequential improvement in the segments pretax income was driven by higher revenues and lower noncomp expenses and again paul will discuss these after i finish this part most importantly on the bottom of the slide you can see very positive trends for client assets and in the number of advisors which grew to despite the elevated number of planned retirements that are typical each december quarter for example in that quarter alone there were advisors who retired or left the business during the quarter wherein most cases we retained substantially all of the client assets our net additions of financial advisors during the quarter was particularly impressive compared to other firms in our industry who have reported so far as most all have reported decreases in net advisors yearoveryear and sequentially but even more impressive the net addition of advisors is quality of the advisors joining raymond james we are attracting very large highquality practices including some in the million to million range over the past four quarters financial advisors with over million of trailing production and over billion of assets at their prior firms have affiliated with raymond james which is a spectacular result and our recruiting pipeline continues to be robust across all of our affiliation options moving to slide the capital markets segment had mixed results during the quarter as revenue and pretax income were up yearoveryear basis but down sequentially compared to the fiscal fourth quarter fixed income brokerage revenue and both equity and debt underwriting revenues were strong during the quarter on the other hand ma revenues and equity brokerage revenues were down from the year ago quarter on the next slide asset management segment generated record quarterly net revenues and pretax income and financial assets under management reached a record of billion increases of on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially these record results were driven by equity market appreciation the net addition of financial advisors and pcg and increased utilization of feebased accounts which more than offset the modest net outflows for carillon tower advisers during the quarter on slide raymond james bank eked out record quarterly net revenues of million a slightly higher than the preceding quarter as loan growth helped offset the basis points sequential decline in the banks net interest income margin caused again by lower shortterm interest rates pretax income was up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially helped by the loan loss benefit of million for the quarter despite loan growth and an uptick in criticized loans during the quarter a higher concentration of residential mortgage which carries lower allowance than ci loans on an average and payoffs of certain lower rated corporate loans resulted in the loan loss benefit net loans ended the quarter at a record billion which was up over december of and over september raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 now ill turn over the call to paul paul shoukry who will provide more detail on the financial results paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks before jumping into the numbers i just want to thank jeff julien whos sitting in the room with us this morning jeff has been a fantastic mentor and friend over the past several years and certainly have big shoes to fill but fortunately jeff has agreed to stick around for a year to help me with the transition so thank you jeff jeffrey paul julien executive vice presidentfinance raymond james financial inc sure paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc want to point out that in addition to the presentation were using for this call we also provided a financial supplement for the first time this quarter which provides similar metrics as our earnings release but over five rolling quarters ill also point out some other requested additions to our disclosures throughout my prepared remarks as always thanks to all of you for your feedback and suggestions to help us continuously enhance our disclosures starting with revenues on slide as paul stated we generated quarterly net revenues of billion which were up on a yearoveryear basis and down compared to the record achieved in the preceding quarter notably about of our net revenues are asset based providing relatively good predictability asset management fees were up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially consistent with the sequential increase of assets in feebased accounts in the preceding quarter assets in feebased accounts were up a substantial during the fiscal first quarter which will be reflected in the private client group segment in the second quarter as most of these assets are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on balances at the end of the preceding quarter also remember about of this line item is driven by financial assets under management primarily in the asset management segment which are built based on a combination of beginning ending and average assets throughout the quarter given one fewer billing day in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the sequential increase in financial assets under management we would expect asset management fees to grow somewhere around to next quarter on a sequential basis brokerage revenues during the quarter of million were pretty healthy as fixed income brokerage revenues were strong again this quarter while brokerage revenues in pcg and institutional equity brokerage revenues improved on a sequential basis they were both still pretty subdued as pcg brokerage commissions are negatively impacted by the shift to feebased accounts and there are cyclical and structural headwinds impacting equity brokerage revenues across the industry particularly for a firm like ours that do not take as much balance sheet risk account and service fees of million were down on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially the decline compared to the fiscal first quarter of was largely attributable to the removal of the money market sweep option last june which is reflected in the asset management segment as well as lower rjbdp fees from raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 thirdparty banks due to lower shortterm interest rates and lower average cash balances which i will discuss in more detail in the next two slides partially offsetting those items was an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fees attributable to more mutual fund positions and higher mutual fund balances investment banking revenues of million were up compared to last years first quarter but down compared to the preceding quarter debt underwriting and equity underwriting revenues were both strong but ma revenues declined on both a yearoveryear and sequential basis as you may recall in fiscal year we generated approximately million of investment banking revenues which was a record that was up from the prior years record given how strong our investment banking revenues were last year we would be pleased to match that result this year assuming market conditions remain conducive which would result in an average of about million of investment banking revenues per quarter so we have some catching up to do after the first quarter ill discuss net interest income in the next two slides but quickly on other revenues which were down substantially this quarter the two primary drivers for the decline in other revenues were lower tax credit fund revenues which had a very strong fourth quarter and a modest valuation loss on private equity investments in the other segment compared to gains in both the fiscal first quarter and fourth quarter of moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for our interest earning assets and the balances with thirdparty banks that generate rjbdp fees ended the quarter at billion representing of domestic pcg client assets which is a record low as far back as we have the data these balances have stabilized since the fiscal third quarter of and increased during the first quarter partially due to tax positioning that is typical at the end of the calendar year unless we encounter elevated market volatility we expect pressure on these balances in the fiscal second quarter due to the quarterly fee billings and income tax payments on slide the top chart displays our firmwide net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in shortterm rates as you can see the three rate cuts totaling basis points since august has put pressure on these revenue streams which on a combined basis are down million from the high watermark in the fiscal second quarter of and thats despite loan growth at raymond james bank on the bottom right portion of the slide we provided a new disclosure that many of you have been requesting during the quarter the average yield on rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was prior to the three rate cuts the average yield reached in the fiscal second quarter of which means the deposit beta averaged approximately for those last three rate cuts given the current level of clients domestic cash sweep balances the reduction of our spread of basis points down to roughly equates to an annual pretax earnings impact of approximately million now this is based on oversimplified math because obviously a good portion of these balances are used to fund the banks balance sheet where loan spreads vary and there is some duration those dynamics are reflected on the nim graph on the bottom left portion of the slide but based on the oversimplified math million would represent approximately of our adjusted pretax income in fiscal year and would reflect a negative impact of approximately to basis points to the comp ratio in pretax margin which well discuss more on the next slide raymond james banks net interest margin declined basis points from the preceding quarter to if short term rates remain constant we would expect the banks nim to remain at around the same level in the second raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 quarter assuming a similar asset mix as the negative impact from the higher mix of lower risk and loweryielding residential mortgages should largely be offset by a reduction in the cash sweep rates we are making this week which will average around basis points and leave us near the top end of the competitive rates similarly we would expect the average yield on rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks to remain around to now ill discuss expenses on slide first let me spend a few minutes on compensation expense which is by far our largest expense the compensation ratio increased sequentially from to this increase was largely driven by revenue mix as compensable revenues in pcg those which have an associated advisor payout have grown to be a higher portion of net revenues while noncompensable revenues have declined as a portion of net revenues as i covered on the prior slide the decrease in shortterm interest rates has pressured a significant portion of the noncompensable revenues meanwhile compensable revenues in the private client group which include asset management fees brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues in the segment were up sequentially these revenues have an average payout between our affiliation options of approximately so when pcgs compensable revenues increase faster than other revenue sources you should expect the compensation ratio to increase just as it decreased substantially when rates increased from through to help you better understand this dynamic we started breaking out pcg financial advisor compensation and benefits in the earnings release and supplement which represented million of the million sequential increase in the firms total compensation during the quarter a roughly of the overall increase this dynamic is expected to continue into the fiscal second quarter as assets in feebased accounts were up during the fiscal first quarter given the growth of financial advisor compensation and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of each calendar year we would expect the compensation ratio to be somewhere around for the fiscal year this represents a 100basispoint increase over our prior target but again this adjustment is primarily a function of lower shortterm interest rates and the change in revenue mix to a larger portion of compensable revenues in pcg on to noncompensation expenses noncompensation expenses during the quarter were million which declined from the preceding quarter and included that preceding quarter included a million goodwill impairment and from the yearago quarter which included a million loss associated with the disposition of our european equities research business given the loan loss benefit and the fact that there were no major recognition events or conferences during the quarter we would expect noncompensation expenses to increase throughout the year more specifically while there are a lot of variables were currently estimating that non compensation expenses in fiscal will total around billion or an average of about million per quarter but as we experienced in the first quarter we also expect a wide range around this target from quartertoquarter and if revenue growth is higher than expected that could drive noncompensation expenses higher as well as certain line items such as subadvisory fee expense are directly tied to revenue growth billion of non compensation expenses in fiscal would represent approximately growth over fiscal which included the two aforementioned nongaap items we believe this would be a good result particularly given the amount of growth we are experiencing as we are extremely focused on containing expense growth as much as possible while still investing for the future slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters the pretax margin was in the fiscal first quarter of given the expense guidance i just provided we would expect the pretax margin to be around for fiscal reflecting a 100basispoint decline from the target that we provided at our analyst raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 investor day before the three recent shortterm rate cuts again this is our best estimate given what we know right now and we all know things can change rapidly in our business slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters where we returned over billion back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the boards authorization we only repurchased million of shares in the fiscal first quarter but we remain committed to at least offsetting stockbased compensation dilution which is approximately million to million per year furthermore as we exhibited last year given our strong capital and liquidity position we will also consider significantly increasing our repurchases if the stock price dips to opportunistic levels which we have stated starts at around times book value we currently have million of remaining share repurchase authorization in summary given the growth of our capital which is already very strong were going to increase our focus on utilizing andor deploying our capital whether it be through higher dividends being more aggressive with our buybacks pursuing corporate development opportunities or accelerating the growth of our balance sheet for example by growing the bank securities portfolio much more rapidly so with that ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks paul and thanks for a lot of guidance update there but again as you recall from our last call we said given the upcoming interest rate changes we couldnt predict we would hold off till this quarter and you can see most of these changes were just caused by the interest rate changes so we provided as much detail typically we would do it at an investor analyst day so we could explain things in person but given the cuts since our last call we felt it was time to update it sooner than later in summary we had three rate cuts since our last analyst investor day in june which has an impact on our pretax income about million so we needed to adjust our comp ratio and pretax margin targets by basis points unlike many of the other firms were in growth mode in almost all of our businesses and there are expenses associated with growth for example weve been consistently adding financial advisors on a net basis whereas most of the larger firms have consistently been losing advisors on a net basis that creates a very different dynamic for our expense trajectory as we are adding to our transition assistance and retention amortization reflected in the compensation but that alone is about million in representing net revenues and million larger than just four years prior were also adding support at the branches and at the home office expanding the size of our branch footprint paying internal and external recruiters paying for acat fees to transfer in accounts and so on growth is expensive but we believe it represents a very good longterm result for our shareholders and given this growth i think a growth in noncomp expenses is a good expense management with the benefit of hindsight we probably could have done a better job explaining our expense growth over the past three years as weve been investing heavily not just in our technology but in our compliance and supervision infrastructure originally to get ready for the dol role which has since been vacated but also to support the future growth in a responsible manner by improving our solutions for advisors and their clients raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 and now im really glad we did make those investments as the secs best interest standard is out and other fiduciary requirements become effective this year if we had not made those significant investments over the past few years such as implementing mantas and actimize and other technologies for aml compliance and supervision we would have struggled more in our implementation efforts for regulation vi but i believe we are in the late stages of that infrastructure and personnel buildout which is why we are confident well be able to decelerate our expense growth going forward despite the significant growth were experiencing across our businesses importantly once we complete the buildout we will be able to support a much larger number of financial advisors and clients on our infrastructure which should result in scale economies over time and that growth really starts with the private client group which is obviously our largest business we are consistently producing bestinclass growth in this business as i said earlier over the past four quarters financial advisors with 300plus million dollars of production and billion of assets at their prior firms have affiliated with raymond james and our recruiting pipeline remains very strong across all of our affiliation options this quarter represents a better start than last years first quarter where we were flattish in the number of advisors the first quarter of every year has significant number of retirements which is typical at year end were off to a good start with this quarter averaging above last years quarterly average the strong recruiting and most importantly our strong retention of existing advisors has helped pcg assets in feebased accounts grow on a yearoveryear basis and on a sequential basis which is among the very best result if not the best result weve seen in our industry on an organic basis the sequential growth is expected to provide a nice tailwind to our revenues in the fiscal second quarter in capital markets weve become accustomed to ma achieving new records each year as weve been investing heavily in that business activity levels in our banking business are still healthy but wed be very happy if we could match last years million in fiscal on the sales and trading side we are still seeing positive trends on fixed income side of the business but we expect the equity side of the business to remain challenged as business continues to shift to lowtouch trading and balance sheet providers the asset management business could continue to benefit from the growth of assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment which has offset the challenging flow environment for carillon tower advisers due to the shift from actively managed products to passively managed products we are entering the second quarter with fiscal assets under management up yearoveryear and sequentially in raymond james bank we are continuing to experience very strong loan growth in the private client group particular residential mortgages given the low rate environment while residential mortgages have lower yields than our corporate loans they have the dual benefit of having very attractive riskadjusted returns while also strengthening our client relationships given where we are in the market cycle we will continue to be extremely selective with loan growth particularly in the corporate loan categories on capital as paul shoukry explained we are fully committed deploying our excess capital we have been extremely engaged on evaluating corporate development opportunities but pricing in many of these has continued to be a challenge at this point in the market cycle we will continue pursuing those opportunities in a deliberate raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 manner but also be more aggressive in our other capital levers including repurchases or growing the balance sheet so overall im cautiously optimistic entering the second quarter as we have had record client assets a record number of financial advisors a record net loans at rj bank the activity levels for financial advisor recruiting remain strong investment banking pipelines remain healthy but given lower shortterm interest rates and how far we are into the bull market the longest ever we are still being focused on managing expenses so with that im going to open it up to questions and turn it over to myra myra question and answer section operator thank you at this time we would like to take any questions you may have for us today operator instructions please note that analysts are allowed one question and one followup question only our first question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is open please go ahead paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey craig craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning everyone paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc so i had a question on recruiting i mean you grew your advisors a healthy clip over the last year and you did have some retirements in the fourth quarter but can you provide a little more color on where those advisors are coming from and if youre seeing increasing competition for advisors from the different groups like the wirehouses and other independent brokers and also why are a lot of those big banks failing in the competition for advisors also paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well i think its just a shift in philosophy that raymond james has a platform where we still have the advisors as our clients we give them an environment that allows them to do whats best for their clients and with no product push we have no quotas on any product managers dont have any incentives i mean we really want advisors to do whats best for them so weve had an attractive platform for a long time and i think today leading technology and i think the banks as theyve tightened some of the both their payouts their structures and a lot of advisors feel like theres less flexibility theyve been leaving not just for us but for other places so i think the regional raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 firms and us have been the beneficiary at the cost of the larger wirehouse firms and that trajectory has continued so thats where most of the recruiting has come its from the wirehouse firms we dont see any slowdown in backlog last year was a near record from the year before and were kind of on the same pace so whether its a record or shorter record i dont know but as of today we still see the same interest in backlog and growth so thats been our strategy for a number of years and we dont see it changing in the shortterm to midterm craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks paul and i had i think two or three questions in there so ill get back in the queue paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hello paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc next question paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc myra operator we have our next question from yes we have our next question from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley you may ask your question your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i was wondering if you could talk about the puts and takes in the noncomp line i know you mentioned that for the full year the noncomp line should be around billion but i was wondering how much room you have in the longer term maybe over the next couple of years to bring that line down a little bit and maybe you can talk to some of the puts and takes by line raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i can give you an overview and ill let paul talked about the puts and takes youve seen that line really taken away the accounting change last year really decelerating over the last couple of years so last year was a deceleration and this year theres been a further deceleration but again sometimes with the accounting change where we had to grow some expenses on revenue recognition some people lose on that so we continue to manage it down and we think weve become better and more efficient with the systems and actually the systems investing actually help the advisors also with their client management so thats been the relationship the large buildup started really a few years ago and its been decelerating now paul you want to talk about any particular line item paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah thats right and to add more color to what paul stated last year the noncomp expenses grew as reported but over half of that was due to nongaap items in the prior year as well as the grossup of expenses due to revenue recognition so if you look at kind of the apples to apples that represented a significant deceleration and were looking to kind of maintain a noncomp expense growth around the same level this year to get to the billion obviously it started off low in the first quarter just given the loan loss credit and other items business development was relatively low given no conferences or recognition trips ph sized and we expect that to sort of build up throughout the year but the last thing i would say on this is a lot of these lines investment subadvisory fees professional fees associated with banking deals et cetera are directly tied to revenue growth so as much as we want to contain the growth that we can contain we also want to fully appreciate the expense growth that is directly tied to revenue growth manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then separately on the nim side i know you mentioned that the nim should be relatively flat going into the fiscal second quarter but i was wondering if you could speak to the outlook more for the full year is there a little more room to bring down costs from the deposit side with betas at around is there still more room maybe as you go into the second half of next quarter or even into the fiscal third quarter is there room to bring deposit costs down paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i think nim staying stable in the second quarter reflects a cut that were making this week of about basis points assuming rates stay stable i do not believe that there is much more room to take deposit costs down from our current average cost after this 5basispoint cut and the only other item i would mention on nim is if we do accelerate the growth of our securities portfolio at the bank which is on the table that would all else being equal bring down the banks nim as were taking the cash off balance sheet at whats earning today bringing it on balance sheet would get a pickup for the firm overall but that would be create pressure for the banks overall nim because the securities portfolio which doesnt have credit risk would have a lower yield than the credit portfolio raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah thats one thing that as we move assets if we grow the banks balance sheet its better off with a consolidated firm but it will show lower nim because its higher interest spread than we would earn off balance sheet but its the nim and the bank would be impacted so manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so neutral to slightly better to pretax margins and it would be slightly detrimental to nim is that correct paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc right paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yes paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc slightly better to pretax but slightly detrimental to nim in the bank yeah manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of devin ryan from jmp securities your line is open you may ask your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great good morning paul and paul paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey devin raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc so i guess first question here just to follow up on the organic growth question on pcg so clearly you guys were making a lot of investments to ramp the infrastructure in recent years and i think thats driving or helping to support the industry leading organic growth but i just wanted to dig in a little more on kind of the commentary being kind of in the late stages of this infrastructure expansion and i get that also adds some expense implications so really the question is have you guys been at all capacity constrained on how fast you can recruit just not having the full infrastructure in place and as you kind of ramp the infrastructure is that going to allow you potentially to close more advisors faster so potentially theres a scenario where organic growth could accelerate and so thats kind of one piece and then im also trying to get a little flavor from a geographic perspective where youre seeing the most momentum and just an update on kind of the northeast and west and how you feel about market shares there paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so on the first question i think that how fast we ramp advisors has to do with first can we find quality advisors that want to come and that we accept we have people that we dont accept too so pipeline is one issue secondly is were still below the market competition increased significantly last year but we were able to match still the same recruiting results without increasing our transition assistance like many of our competitors have so the question really for us is how fast can we grow and assimilate advisors without hurting the service levels of existing advisors because i think what really is driving our numbers is retention so thats focus number one most of the investment hasnt been on what i call pure recruiting i think we do have the platform if it went up and we could find more advisors we could onboard them a lot of the investment has been on the supervision and compliance side and that was in reference to both just our growing to be a larger firm certainly our aml issue a few years ago if you remember we decided that we are going to ramp up all of our systems both aml compliance and supervision invested heavily in mantas and actimize and other systems which are very expensive but we have mantas fully up and running and actimize almost there and a large head count growth and supervision and compliance so that will help us ramp people that part of the infrastructure is very scalable and i dont think well have to increase it or it will increase much lower than we can ramp and support advisors so that part has been the biggest build really starting a couple of years ago and maybe in a way we invested some of the interest rate spreads to build till our infrastructure only had that opportunity so were in good shape there so i think youll see it more in the noncomp and i think the transition assistance we dont see going down were already amongst probably the lowest in the industry the competitors in what we pay competitive but it is lower and the acat is an industry expense that when people came over we pay for the accounts to move thats industry kind of standard and those kind of fees wont go away purely for recruiting but again we believe those have good roes and exceptional long term mid to longterm benefits for the business devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 geography paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and geography we continue to increase i think certainly the northeast were seeing a much more activity given our investments there in the west that is growing i mean were growing i would say but our percent share is still very low so what i like is that our flags are being expanded i think weve done better in the northeast than the west but were growing percentage wise the highest in those markets but again we have if we could get our market share in the rest of the country in the west and northeast we have a lot of growth for a lot of years if we can just achieve that over the next three to five years weve got plenty of recruiting opportunities so were making progress recruiting is interesting because its a long process very rarely do you get someone whos just going to leave if they do leave quickly sometimes theres an issue so youre cautious and we have recruits that we say well i was here in and i should have come then and they join us and some have been here for two years before they make the move so it takes a while to build the momentum and pipeline and i think were doing a good job in both of those markets making progress and i still think we have acceleration opportunity there devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great thanks for all the color and just a quick followup so on the comp ratio and margin targets that you put out there i understand that your business mix is going to be a big input and it was this quarter as well do those targets and comp ratio and just kind of overall margin in the outlook does that assume any additional fed cuts or equity market appreciation from here paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc no i think its kind of a static analysis of todays interest rate environments in this market this is what we would expect the only way to really impact that is to substantially change our mix or change our payouts and i think we like the mix and itll come and go depending on the quarter and payouts we always do those sparingly but when we need to do them we do them as you know so as we look through bi and other things well look at that as we always do devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thank you guys paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research your line is open please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 hi good morning paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey steve paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so paul welcome to your first official call as cfo appreciate the detailed update on expenses and capital i was really hoping you could speak to maybe now youre in the new seat what some of your priorities are and specifically wanted to unpack your comments in just a couple of areas the appetite to maybe reduce gearing to the short end of the curve and how you might look to grow the securities book which i think you alluded to capital return appetite if your stock is trading a little bit above that times book value thresholds and maybe just some enhanced disclosure on organic growth so securities book capital return and organic growth disclosure paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thats a dense question there steven but thank you steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc it is im still going to take my followup paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah in terms of the securities portfolio i mean we have actually grown it substantially over the last few years here and were just looking at the amount of cash we have off balance sheet what the forward curve is telling us and the amount of capital we have to and the capacity to grow assets on our balance sheet and its something that were considering doing itll be modest maybe billion to billion sort of over a period of time in terms of accelerating the growth of incremental securities and again were not looking to take credit risk in that portfolio this would be mostly agency mortgagebacked securities with duration of three to four years and with that you would get somewhere around today it changes every day but today around basis points of incremental pickup over what we earn off balance sheet in terms of repurchases i mean were going to stay consistent with what weve been doing for a very long time were going to we said were going to offset dilution and then as weve shown last year were we have plenty of capital liquidity and authorization to increase our repurchases if the price drops to what we consider opportunistic levels and thats something that were going to remain committed to doing as well and then obviously the other priority is expenses which weve discussed in pretty good detail already raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and just the enhanced disclosure on the organic growth paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i mean we are working i think its referring specifically to the net new asset metric that is something we are working on i think over the last two or three quarters the number of inbound requests for that has subsided somewhat because when you look at the yearoveryear growth in assets in feebased accounts i think everyone has acknowledged that thats among the highest if not the highest in the industry so i think were getting credit for their organic growth but at the same time we appreciate the sort of desire to have it easier sort of metric to track in that regard so its something we are looking at but kind of tying back to your first question on expense growth nothing is free and so were doing it in the context of our other it priorities that we have across the firm paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think one of the challenges right now too for the industry is that our focus is reg bi its effective june so as we look at it and ops time its all focused to being making sure right now that were compliant and have our systems up there are process and disclosure and other document changes that are required so any excess capacity or its really first priority but any excess capacity weve had to do these other things have been focused on bi till we get them done to do them effectively we have to start rolling things out weve started to roll things out already because we have to have them up and running and in place and done by june not start doing them on june so steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and just one followup for me on expenses you guys cited some progress in slowing the pace of core non comps thats certainly evident but the elevated comp pressure is continuing to weigh disproportionately on the margin as we look ahead with nim stabilizing in revenue growth coming from more compensable activities within pcg im just trying to think about longer term how should we view that incremental margin as those dollars come on and most of the growth comes from feegenerating activities just trying to think about the earnings growth algorithm beyond paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i mean i think given the current rate environment and market environment which obviously are the two big factors that would impact your margin as along with revenue mix but i think as of right now as best as we can tell for the comp ratio and for the pretax margin is the best visibility we have given our current revenue mix so to the extent that we the market environment changes interest rate environment changes or our revenue mix changes then we would adjust those targets paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so this quarter was impacted by lower ma and tax credit funds which are of course i mean theyre cyclical theyre never versus the pcg business so that impacted us but the interest rate is the big change raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 and thats just math i mean im kind of amazed that we could lose of our pretax and that much revenue from those three changes and make it up almost make it up in one quarter so but i dont again the only way to really change that is looking at payouts across our system and what we pay folks for production thats where its all going but at least that expense is good growth thats production and profit growth so well take the growth in that ratio we can grow the revenues even faster and add to the margins so we want to make sure theyre competitive and fair and as things shift and change over time we will look at that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks very much paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks steve operator our next question comes from the line of bill katz from citi your line is open please go ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking the questions this morning thanks for the enhanced disclosure just sort of coming back to margin discussion a little bit more as you look at the segment level for private client im sort of wondering whats your longterm outlook beyond fiscal and sort of where that margin might be get to and what are the drivers there and then related to that that payout that you mentioned earlier in your prepared comments how is that relative to market levels paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would tell you in terms of the private client group margin a lot of it really depends on geography so to the extent that we have movement to feebased accounts continue which weve had obviously a lot of the benefit gets reflected in our asset management segment to the extent that we sweep more cash to raymond james bank which were considering doing even more so with the growth in the securities portfolio that would increase the margin at raymond james bank relative to private client group so really we kind of look at the margins on a consolidated basis we think thats the most meaningful especially when comparing across firms because a lot of firms have their bank and their asset management feebased platform in their wealth management segment so we expect it again on a consolidated basis our best guess right now is or better for the pretax margin and then the payout the payout is just a function of the mix between our employee channel and on the independent contractor channel where the independent contractors are paid in the range and so when you blend the two is where you get the type payout on the production not the overall revenues to the firm but the revenues that are compensable to the advisors on average generate raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay its helpful indiscernible william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc and then just paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc im sorry to interrupt you and just my followup you sort of mentioned that a corporate development has been of a priority but pricing is a little heavy so sort of wondering where you could maybe you could sort of help at least from a backdrop or a color perspective of where youre most focused whether it be in sort of bolstering the private client side or other segments of the business and then conversely as you look at your business and think about the mix a year or two years from now are there any businesses that youre in today that you could maybe deemphasize a little bit to overall bolster roe paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc if you look at where most of our roe is generated or capital is deployed its first in the bank which is our biggest capital deployer and we like where that is and then private client group where its really transition assistance and investment in that business including technology so we kind of like the businesses were in and the mix were honestly open private client group is our anchor business so we always look to that first but were actually open to things that will grow any of our segments we like the businesses we think theyre performing relatively well now to the market and if theres opportunity because were not capital bound right now we would do something that first has economic sense to shareholders but it has to first make the business better not just bigger we avoid things just to be bigger but dont really have good roe to the shareholders so were focused on all four we continue to be in dialogue but i would say over the last year weve had more dialogues that ended without anyone trading because we just felt the market was too the ask was too high and i think the market agreed on a lot of those assets sort of the ask was just too high so were not going to do something just to do something william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you indiscernible raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 operator we have our next question from the line of jim mitchell from buckingham research your line is open please go ahead james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good morning paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc maybe we could just follow up on the comp in pcg a little bit if i look at whether yearoveryear or sequentially if i look at total comp not just sort of the compensation for the advisors but look at total comp relative to compensable revenues sequentially and yearoveryear total comps growing faster than revenue and so youre getting negative leverage or negative incremental margins out of the total comp line and can you just kind of help us understand whats driving total comp is that the other comp is that just the recruiting thats maybe at some point going to slow because i would think at some point you need to get positive incremental margins off revenue even if its not just the fa advisors paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah the biggest driver of that as i talked about earlier is the buildup of support both aml compliance and supervision all three of those functions weve made starting three years ago almost significant investments really accelerated that growth over the last couple of years but now its decelerating so thats the leverage we think well get out so maybe in some areas we have to play a little catchup but weve really build it for the future and i think thats where our noncomp leverage is going to come from so thats an awful lot of it paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think the other thing you have to do going back to our whole dialogue around compensable versus non compensable revenues on a yearoveryear basis private client group is showing growth in total revenues but its really growth in compensable revenues and the compensable revenues is the production the number of advisors the number of accounts et cetera and thats really whats going to drive both the payout and the support and infrastructure needs so the still is lower than the and the being the administrative non fa comp in the private client group business the reason its higher is for the reasons that paul mentioned but if you kind of look back three years to support the fact that were sort of in the later stages of this infrastructure buildout three years ago that line grew in fiscal the admin comp and pcg grew the last year it grew yearoveryear for the quarter it grew and thats sort of what were budgeting for the year so its come down substantially as weve in the later stages of this buildout in private client group business james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc and so that should continue to sort of further slow and not be so tied to revenue raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc is that fair paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yes paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay and then and maybe just a followup and just talking more about the balance sheet potential balance sheet growth would that be sort of slow more impactful in if you decide to do that or if you do decide to go ahead with it how quickly could you put assets on the balance sheet paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc we can grow the securities portfolio billion billion pretty rapidly jim so if its something that we decide to move forward with which is something that were still having to discuss internally i would expect the first couple billion if we do decide to move forward with it to occur pretty quickly but again were still in discussions on that james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay great thanks paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks jim operator that completes our questionandanswer session ill turn you now ill turn it back to paul reilly paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay well great well thank you for joining us and again we normally like to do this on an investor analyst day but again holding off last year we said we wanted to wait to see what happened how many rate cuts or to provide you the data you can see why now because had there been one more cut or one less cut it would have significantly impacted our comp ratios our earnings our mix so wish we could have gotten to you a little bit sooner but we got it to you as fast as we could and thank
