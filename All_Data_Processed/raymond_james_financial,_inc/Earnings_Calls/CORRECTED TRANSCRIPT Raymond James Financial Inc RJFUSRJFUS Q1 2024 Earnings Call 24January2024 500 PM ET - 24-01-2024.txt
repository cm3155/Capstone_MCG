and ceo paul reilly paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you kristie good evening thank you for joining us today who would have thought given all the uncertainty over the past year we would have ended the last fiscal year with record results and generated record earnings per share and record client assets this quarter this is a testament to our focus on executing on our strategic priorities which are rooted in our advisor and client focused cultures these priorities have remained consistent over many years they are to drive organic growth throughout our businesses invest in technology and service capabilities and to maintain focus on strategic ma and effective integrations through our relentless focus on these priorities we have maintained longterm success across changing market environments now to review the first quarter results starting on slide the firm reported quarterly net revenues of billion an increase of over the prior year quarter primarily due to higher assetbased revenues quarterly net income available to common shareholders was million or a record per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share both records we generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of a great result particularly given our strong capital base moving to slide client assets grew to record levels this quarter driven by strong advisor retention and recruiting results along with the strong market total client assets under administration increased sequentially to raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 trillion private client group assets in feebased accounts grew to billion and financial assets under management reached billion pcg continues to generate strong organic growth evidenced this quarter with domestic net new assets of billion representing a annualized growth rate on beginning of period domestic pcg assets advisors are attracted to our robust technology capabilities and client first values and through our long established multiple affiliation options they can find the right fit for their business during the quarter we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing production and billion of client assets at their previous firms these results do not include our ria custody services businesses which also continued to have a recruiting success and finished the quarter with billion of assets despite strong recruiting activity the financial advisor count was sequentially flat mostly due to an elevated number of retirements which are seasonally higher in the first quarter but where the firm typically retains the vast majority of assets through previously established succession plan in addition advisors moving to our ria channel are excluded from the advisor count since they no longer carry a finra license with us we announced that the president of our pcg independent contractor division jodi perry transitioned to a newly created role of national head of advisor recruiting jodi has generated outstanding results in every role she has held in her nearly 30year career with raymond james and i am confident she will continue to strengthen this key growth engine for the firm this key leadership appointment continues to highlight the importance and focus on advisor recruiting with this transition we are excited about shannon reid becoming the pcg independent contractor division president and joining the firms executive committee shannon has most recently served as senior vice president of our northeast division she has an impressive background and has been a stellar leader in an important market total clients domestic sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up over september balances were boosted by growth in both the enhanced savings program as well as the client sweep balances bank loans increased from the preceding quarter to a record billion although loan demand remains relatively muted given higher rates moving to slide private client group generated quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear results were driven by higher asset management fees reflecting growth of assets and feebased accounts the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax income of million investment banking revenues grew compared to a year ago quarter due to higher ma and underwriting revenues sequentially robust fixed income brokerage revenue growth largely offset weaker ma and affordable housing investment results while fixed income results were stronger during the quarter investment banking activity industry wide appeared to be on a gradual recovery the uncertain market environment along with the impact of the amortization of sharebased compensation granted in the preceding periods has strained the nearterm profitability of segment results we remain focused on managing controllable expenses the asset management segment generated pretax income of million on net revenues of million results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into pcg feebased accounts the bank segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million bank segment net interest margin of declined basis points compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to a higher cost mix of deposits as enhanced savings program balances that replaced a portion of lower rjbdp cash sweep balances raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 now ill turn it over to paul shoukry for a more detailed review of the first quarter results paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting on slide consolidated net revenues were billion in the first quarter up over the prior year and down sequentially compared to the record set in the preceding quarter asset management and related administrative fees grew over the prior year and declined compared to the preceding quarter the sequential decline was largely the result of lower feebased assets at the beginning of the quarter compared to the beginning of the preceding quarter this quarter feebased assets increased which will be a strong tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal second quarter brokerage revenues of million grew yearoveryear mostly due to higher transactional activity in pcg sequentially brokerage revenues increased the result of higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues as client activity increased and the trading environment was more favorable ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million increased yearoveryear sequentially the decline was driven predominantly by lower ma revenues we are cautiously optimistic that the environment for ma is improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity however there remains a lot of uncertainty and we are hopeful a gradual recovery will lead to better results over the next six months to nine months other revenues of million were down compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to lower affordable housing investment revenues compared to the seasonally high fiscal fourth quarter moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets advisors continue to serve their clients effectively leveraging our competitive cash offerings many clients have now taken advantage of the attractive enhanced savings program and other high yielding products thus the pace of flows into this program has decelerated as we expected growing approximately million or this quarter a large portion of the total cash coming into esp has been new cash brought into the firm by advisors highlighting the attractiveness of this product and raymond james being viewed as a source of strength and stability while we are encouraged by the modest sequential growth of client cash balances during the quarter which was helped by seasonal tailwinds in the fourth calendar quarter we continue to expect some further yield seeking activity by clients through monday of this week sweep and esp balances are down approximately billion for the month of january primarily due to quarterly fee billings of billion rjbdp sweep balances with thirdparty banks were billion at quarter end up from september the strong growth of enhanced savings program balances at raymond james bank has allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet with thirdparty banks while this dynamic has negatively impacted the bank segments nim because of the lower cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet it ultimately provides clients win an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firms funding flexibility by providing a large funding cushion for when attractive growth opportunities emerge looking forward we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million down from the preceding quarter due to lower firm wide net interest income resulting from nim compression but outperforming our expectations on the last earnings call as client cash balance were more stable than we raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 expected at that time the bank segment net interest margin decreased basis points sequentially to for the quarter and the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased basis points to while there are many variables that will impact actual results absent any changes to shortterm interest rates we currently expect combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks to be about lower in the fiscal second quarter compared to the fiscal first quarter just based on spot balances after the fee billings this quarter and our expectation of some continued client cash sorting activity hopefully we can outperform this expectation again this quarter but we believe its prudent to air on the side of conservatism given the continued uncertainty around client cash balance trends we remain focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income in rjbdp fees over the long term which we believe we are wellpositioned to do moving to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was excluding acquisition related compensation expenses the adjusted compensation ratio was looking ahead the impact of salary increases effective on january and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter noncompensation expenses of million decreased sequentially largely due to elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters in the preceding quarter whereas this quarter was a relatively quiet quarter for legal and regulatory reserves the bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter declined to million ill discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients for the fiscal year we expect non compensation expenses excluding provision for credit losses unexpected legal and regulatory items or non gaap adjustments to be around billion this implies incremental noncompensation growth throughout the year as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for advisors and their clients throughout our businesses and remember many of the noncompensation expenses such as investment subadvisory fees represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters this quarter we generated a pretax margin of and an adjusted pretax margin of a strong result given the industry wide challenges impacting capital markets as a reminder our current targets provided at our analyst and investor day last may are for a pretax margin of 20plus percent and a compensation ratio of less than we still think these targets are appropriate and we will provide an update as needed at the next analyst and investor day scheduled for may on slide at quarter end total balance sheet assets were billion a sequential increase liquidity and capital remain very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target and we remain wellcapitalized with a tier leverage ratio of and a total capital ratio of our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate for the quarter was reflecting a tax benefit recognized for sharebased compensation that vested during the period going forward we still believe that to is an appropriate estimate to use in your models slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share as of january approximately billion remained available under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization our current plan which is subject to change is to repurchase at least million of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 shares in the fiscal second quarter to complete the remaining repurchases associated with the dilution from the tristate capital acquisition following the second quarter we expect to continue to offset sharebased compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan loss allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was at quarterend we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our corporate loan portfolio including the commercial real estate portfolio within the cre portfolio we have prudently limited the exposure to office loans which represent just of the bank segments total loans now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as ive said at the start of the call i am pleased with our results for the first fiscal quarter generating record earnings per share and ending the quarter with record client assets and while there is still economic uncertainty i believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be positively impacted by the sequential increase of assets in feebased accounts near term we expect some headwinds to the interest sensitive earnings at both pcg and the bank segment given ongoing cash sorting activity and uncertain rate environment however we are already seeing some of the higher yield competitor rates coming in despite this i believe our effort and focus on being a destination of choice for our current and prospective advisors will continue to drive industry leading growth our advisor recruiting activity remains robust including a record number of large teams in the pipeline in the capital markets segment we continue to have a healthy ma pipeline and good engagement levels but our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions and we would expect activity to likely pick up over the next six months to nine months and the fixed income business we saw improvements in this quarter with higher activity but the dynamics of the past year persist depository clients are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity we hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize we will start to see an improvement despite some of the nearterm challenges we believe capital markets business is well positioned for growth once the market and rate environment become conducive in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter up over the preceding quarter which should provide a tailwind to revenues we remain confident that strong growth of assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management to help drive further growth over time raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 in the bank segment we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand we have seen security based loans payoffs decelerate and are starting to experience growth we expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates with little activity in the market corporate loan growth has been muted however spreads have improved and with ample client cash balances in capital we are well positioned to lend once activity increases in our conservative risk parameters in addition to our focus on organic growth across our businesses we have also ramped up corporate development efforts in closing we are wellpositioned entering the second fiscal quarter with strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth as always i would be remiss if i did not thank our advisors and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients thank you for all you do that concludes our prepared remarks operator will you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of michael cho from jpmorgan your line is open michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good evening thanks for taking my question for my first question i just wanted to touch on net new assets and clearly there seems to be a pickup in nna and you continue to call out a robust recruiting backdrop and the question is what do you think is driving that nna acceleration now and how much do you think a more stable macro outlook could contribute for nna acceleration from here paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc well historically like this quarter its a pretty good nna number so whats really driving it is still great retention recruiting and most of our recruiting the advisor count number is a little misleading now because were recruiting more and more larger very large teams fewer number but larger teams this quarter we had a lot of retirements but the retirement seasonally we do at the end of the year but in retirements almost all of them have transition plans so we keep the assets which drives the advisor count number down and when people transfer to the ria division which happens every quarter we take them out because they dont have a finra license so if you look at the net asset net new assets you go over the last few years and then we continued to be near the top of the market or at the top of the market and its really just a great retention and robust recruiting and as we recruit larger and larger teams a lot of those teams are their businesses are still growing significantly and its really generating net new assets and of course theres market health right as the market goes up you bring people over the assets are higher raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 so but we feel pretty comfortable and as we announced we brought over jodi perry to really even add more robustness to our recruiting efforts which were diversified or spread out between the channels but really bringing them together to a more unified effort we think we can do better than we have been doing michael y cho q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great no thanks for all that color i just want to switch gears on the capital markets segment specifically investment bank i mean you continue to invest in talent there despite the choppy backdrop over the last months and i think youve called out a higherquality bank or higherproducing bank or raymond james now versus previous periods i mean how should we think about something like revenue per md going forward in a more normalized environment if the backlog starts to flow through at some point paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well back in the last the peak of the last market we exceeded million per md so i mean we generate a very very high productive number if you go back a few years were a couple of million dollars per md and that really is the difference so part of thats the market but certainly part of that was the high quality mds recruited and the teams that joined us so i dont know what that number is in a good market i think we could still produce that number or better we continue to recruit people in some of the businesses that we felt were subscale or didnt have the senior people that we wanted and i think the productivity is still there so if we had a market as robust as we did couple of years ago we could top that million but certainly wed be much higher in the highsingle digits i think in a reasonable market but again the market as weve said is we see slow improvement but nothing thats really moving quickly up but moving up steadily operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan from jmp securities your line is open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks much good evening paul and paul paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc so first question if you could go back to your early calendar you guys had built a fair amount of liquidity and maybe gave up some interest income shortterm and i think the view was that lending spreads could widen out and so you wanted to have some capacity and obviously this was also a reason to be conservative at that raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 time but it did seem like some of that maybe the headwinds to spread revenues was more of a timing dynamic and intentional so looking at today you still have a lot of excess liquidity to grow loans if you see attractive risk adjusted return so im just curious if kind of that view still holds that you had kind of through most of calendar and then are those better spreads materializing as maybe you thought they would or are you still waiting for that im just trying to think about the interplay with that and then accelerating lending activity into that as well thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think theres two pieces to that devin is that we have seen spreads widen the problem is that the market hasnt been really robust in the area that we like to lend in we have a target both in industries borrowers its fairly conservative and that pipeline of new loans that you can see from other banks too has just slowed down so were still waiting for that kind of resurgence in activity which we think will happen at some point but thats really been the were ready to lend were also seeing that sbl loans and things which was deteriorating weve seen that the payoffs are really decreasing were seeing some growth there now too so were starting to see the beginning of growth in those portfolios but certainly the market isnt giving us that opportunity to put on loans at the same rate we did in like early or certainly devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thanks paul and then just a followup on the institutional fixed income brokerage obviously really material improvement in the quarter and youre kind of run rating over million last year you did mid and just looking at like relative to youre down over even though you have sumridge today and arguably a bigger better business so what do you think about kind of the some of the momentum that you saw in the quarter depositories are maybe becoming more active again and just how to think about kind of what a normalization in that business looks like is it the call it a little bit over million run rate that we saw in this quarter is it something better and is this quarter kind of a good jumping off point because it is such a stark change from the prior quarter thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so its first a pretty fickle market sumridge has done well the whole time they traded on volatility so if you look at volatility you could probably look at their results theyre really good very hedged very focused corporate trading strategy and consistently have executed since day one and their business has not been off its done well our traditional depository business which is a big part of our franchise as they got cash squeezed it slowed down two things were happening a lot of banks already had plenty of fixed rate maturities and they werent looking for more bonds and they were worried about their liquidity i think what happened in december as liquidity looked like it was easing some and rates look like they were going to come down they got much more active so i think that environment which has been okay beginning of the year but its too early to tell is what happens with rates if people really think these are fixed rates and liquidity continues to feel settled theyll get more active raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 or at least be active as they are today but i dont see the return of two years ago until the market really gets a lot better and a lot stable they performed very very well and its just if rates go up its going to be a headwind if rates go down some or the view of rates going down materializes or people get confident i think it will pick up operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon from jefferies your line is open daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good evening wanted to follow up on your comments around cash sorting and your expectation that you expect that to continue and curious if thats just some of the seasonal cash coming back into the market that maybe built up in december and or what other factors you think that are going to continue to have that be an ongoing trend beyond the billing and other things you mentioned so far in january paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah you touched on them i mean we in the december quarter typically have sort of seasonal tailwinds with tax loss harvesting maturities and those type of things and then throughout the year quarterly fee billings alone this quarter were north of billion and well hopefully see that continue to grow throughout the year and then we also have the headwind as we enter april with income taxes as well so rates are still high there out there theyve come in a little bit as paul said just with the expectation for lower rates so we have seen some declines across the industry but really money market funds are the yields they are really the biggest competitor we have if you will and those yields are still attractive and so we still have to have attractive alternatives to bring in new cash to compete against the money market fund so as i said in the last couple of calls i think were much closer to the end of that cash sorting dynamic then we get closer and closer i feel like every quarter but were not going to declare that its over until we have several months of history to prove it out paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and i think that people look at kind of the data there is ill say if rates come down well before that spread increase quickly well on normal sweeps they kind of follow fed funds but really if you look at money markets theyre more theyre buying bonds and it takes two weeks to three weeks for them to adjust so if there are if you consider them some of the competition for rate its going to take a few weeks at least for that to sort through before theres yeah before rates start moving at the more expensive people who are investing in higher yielding types of certificates but itll be moving in the right direction of rates indiscernible daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thank you and then just as a followup within pcg insurance and annuity products have been growing and a bigger contributor just curious with the dols proposal how you think that these products might be impacted or momentum that might be impacted by the proposal paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 so first theres always been scrutiny on those products over time and we believe we have good products and systems to manage that and the dol we have put in systems to comply with a fairly similar law in the beginning and then we had to take them out as the industry defeated the rule the second interpretation of questions came out and the industry defeated the rule so well have to see in court and well have to see what this rule finishes with before we look at the impact and my guess is the industry will challenge the rule again so weve won twice well my guess i think therell be a substantial challenge with a lot of things that could challenge what is proposed today and so well have to see so im kind of early to speculate on that so its finalized until we see if it really can withstand the third court challenge operator your next question comes from the line of kyle voigt from kbw your line is open kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening sorry about that so first on the balance sheet just given how much sweep cash you have sitting off balance sheet at this point at billion and the excess capital youre currently running with combined with the shape of the forward curve would you consider beginning to grow the securities portfolio again over the next few quarters and start to lock in some yield or do you still have a preference to allow that to run off paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah kyle our position on taking duration on the balance sheet has remained very consistent through different rate cycles which certainly positioned us well this time last year which is really to keep more of a floating rate balance sheet and not try to time rates one way or the other to the extent that we do take duration on the balance sheet we really want it to be to support and accommodate client needs in our mortgages and those tax exempt loans et cetera and so were really not looking to try to time what might happen to rates i know the forward curve has been wrong more than right in the last two years to three years and this misguided a lot of other firms and so were just going to remain flexible and really focus on accommodating clients versus making bets for our own benefit paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and weve heard a lot of people speculate over at the top rates but we went from no rate cuts to three to people speculating six to speculate well maybe we wont get one per month so we just dont want to really play that game and i think one of the key is to our consistent performance is were not making bets were just consistently running the business so we really dont look at locking in rates like that and right now the spread on the sweep rates is very very good and compelling anyways so kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah understood maybe just a question on the noncomp expense guidance of billion i think that implies a increase or so in the average noncomp expenses for the remaining three quarters versus the first quarter run rate i know there are some variable expenses that you laid out in terms of the investment advisory fees but just wondering if you could expand a bit on some of the other areas where you may be ramping investments through the remainder of the year raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah this quarter was pretty low almost across the board it the technology expenses we typically pull back on external support during the december quarter just because its a little bit slower for those vendors as well even to bring people in its a relatively quiet quarter for conferences and trips and so we and it was also a relatively favorable quarter for legal and regulatory and so i think as the year progresses we should expect to see growth to get to that billion sort of guidance and as a reminder that excludes some of the nongaap items which most of you exclude as well as the bank loan loss provision and unexpected legal and regulatory reserves because its just hard its impossible for us to try to forecast those over the next three quarters paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc that was kind of our initial guidance was the billion so were just it is lumpy but we still think thats a good number operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken from ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good evening thanks for taking my questions curious if you could maybe disclose what portion of your client asset bases is in retirement accounts and also when you think about recruiting typically how much of those assets tend to come in in the form of retirement accounts iras and the like paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah we will provide more of that breakout at our analyst investor day in may when we last went through this in last time we disclosed this metric it was about a third of the assets were in iras and retirement accounts but we havent provided any real disclosure on that since then so well plan on doing that at the analyst and investor day brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that paul and then when you think about nna had a nice jump here this quarter was there bank activity within the bank channel here in the quarter that might have caused some of the significant quarter overquarter changes and generally whats your outlook for growth coming from that channel in the near term paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc there wasnt anything lumpy in the bank channel we that tends to be a lumpier one just because of the with advisors theres many many so they average out with the banks we dont expect anything lumpy its part of our growth platform and i think our nna has continued to be very very solid so we like the trajectory and this is i think a very strong number both given the environment and given our competitors this quarter and still believe we have opportunity to keep we dont forecast a number but i think we can be right at the top of nna raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks brennan operator our next question comes from the line of bill katz from td cowen your line is open bill katz q analyst td cowen okay thank you very much good evening and i appreciate taking the questions maybe to mix up the topics a little bit just wondering if we could circle back to capital return just given the fact that you have a very strong capital position you mentioned sort of mixed dynamics on the loan side or lending side why not pick up the pace of capital return through buyback and then maybe as a subsector to that whats your incremental thinking of inorganic opportunities at this point and what might you be looking at thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so we think first we were a little late into the quarter because we had a selfimposed blackout given we said given an accrual for our offplatform communications so we got a little late jump and so we werent in a rush we had a good period in that market so we didnt try to catch up but were committed to next quarter the million which i think will catch us up on the tristate commitment and continue on our dilutions as we go forward to be opportunistic we are trying to balance as weve said we put a new head of corporate development were seeing a lot of opportunities in the market and we want to make sure that just like i remember the timing two years ago people were saying are you ever going to spend the cash we got over and we did six acquisitions in months right and got our ratio down to so and the reason we could do them is we have capital on the balance sheet and we think there are opportunities the problem is you never know if theyre actionable you can talk a lot but were certainly out in the market and looking and so we just try to balance those two the good news is we have strong earnings so we understand well keep adding to the capital base but we were just trying to balance the two of them we think million is a good target and if we cant get if we get to the point where we dont think there are accretive acquisitions that would be accretive to the positioning of the firm not just earnings we will buy back stock were not trying to hoard capital our rsus at least half of them are roe and tsr base so were not trying to hoard capital just for fun we just think its the right thing to do looking at the potential opportunities bill katz q analyst td cowen okay just a followup maybe talk about margins for a moment i appreciate that we will look forward to the investor day in the spring but just conceptually though to the extent that the investment banking backdrop were to pick up how do we think about the incremental margin in both the segment and how that might translate down to the holding company at this point in time obviously youre running about breakeven if you will im just trying to think through the puts and takes of some pressure on nii offset by maybe a little bit more countercyclical pick up in the ph ibank and how that might filter down to profitability thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah bill i think in the capital markets segment when they were operating at record levels over the last couple of years two years ago they i think had a maximum margin or a record margin of around and so that just shows you the upside potential for that segment and now its both the equity side and the fixed income side of the business running on all cylinders which is somewhat atypical across the industry just given the countercyclical nature of some of those businesses but theres a lot of upside from just breaking even this quarter in capital markets to what the potential is and that we proved out couple of years ago and that obviously would help the overall margin of the firm were still saying its a 20plus margin target for the firm at this juncture well update that as appropriate at the analyst investor day in may but we have a diversified business so theres always puts and takes and what we dont try to do is sell you on a story thats just at the incremental margin of everything happening to the plus side without factoring in potential offsets and so we think thats a more balanced approach but obviously all else being equal if we have the same exact sort of performance from the other businesses with the upside potential of capital markets that would be accretive to the margins overall for the firm but were just reluctant to guide that now given all the uncertainty particularly around cash sorting dynamics which is a huge driver of margins the cash balances and where interest rates are as a big driver of margins for the firm so were going to be conservative there until things stabilize operator your next question comes from a line of steven chubak from wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good evening paul and paul i wanted to start off with a question on deposit betas and pricing flex amid rate cuts just one of the challenges that we collectively are grappling with is that your mix of deposits is quite different than peers you have a lower concentration of higher beta savings deposits that should carry very high deposit betas with rate cuts at the same time your current payout on your sweep deposits is actually much more competitive than your peer set so i was hoping you could frame separately what your expectation is for deposit pricing flex on the ph espps versus the sweep deposits within the bank channel paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean we see esp balances we would expect the correlation or the movement of those rates to be much more aligned with what happens with fed funds effective and i think thats what advisors and clients expect not only at raymond james but across the industry as well for those higher yielding products you say its different in terms of mix of deposits than others in the industry but you also have to remember with the tristate acquisition and they have billion of deposits now which are higher cost deposits and a likely higher beta deposits too both on the upside and on the downside of rates so it gives us more similar sensitivity than just looking at the sort of pcg related deposits which we feel good about and then as you point out the bdp the sweep deposits we were much more generous than most of our competitors on the way up which gives us more kind of cushion on the way down as well with those deposits so as paul said its going to be a competitive dynamics something that well look at as rates move but we feel really good about the position were in right now raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color paul and for my followup its related to what bill had just asked but i was hoping to pin you down with an explicit number in terms of how to think about incremental margins because the offset from lower rates is clearly expected to come from the capital markets side of the business the concern is that nii is non compensable but if we actually look at what you guys did during the period of robust capital markets activity you cited the plus type margins the incremental margins were actually close to during that period so just want to get a sense if we do have a more meaningful ramp in capital markets activity is incremental margin a reasonable assumption consistent with what we saw during the covid period paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean i guess what i would say is if you kind of look at the revenues now versus the revenues of the peak of capital markets and being breakeven now versus getting a margin during the peak of capital markets i mean its pretty linear theres a lot of incremental margin as you grow revenues from the current base to where we were at that point in time so it also depends on frankly the mix of revenues in capital markets how much comes from ma versus underwriting versus fixed income all those businesses have different incremental margins too so we can make up a simplistic number for modeling purposes but frankly i think itd be false precision and we also know that the dynamics that may help the capital markets business may be dynamics that may positively or negatively impact our other businesses so were generating a plus margin and generating record earnings in the last three years in very different market environments its something that really reinforces the value of having our diversified business model and being able to generate adjusted returns on tangible common equity of over this quarter on our strong capital basis without the support of capital markets is something were really happy about operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good evening maybe just a quick question on the brokerage sweeps your yield went up net yield went up again youve had pricing power how long do you think the pricing power can last i mean deposits in the industry have seemingly stabilized for banks does that start to erode some of that pricing power whats your outlook on the sweep pricing paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah were still seeing a lot of demand for these deposits across the banks that we deal with so we still think that theres pricing power but in fairness the pricing power were talking about is basis points to basis points which on the balances of billion is meaningful but it pales in comparison to whats happening with the base rates nowadays so and what might happen going down or up so we still think theres pricing power theres a lot of demand for these deposits but were hopeful that over the next year or two were using more of these deposits to grow the balance sheet and support clients with loan activity which generates higher yields and returns for the firm overall raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc great make sense and then maybe as a followup on just sort of the large team pipeline sort of at a record i think you highlighted that last quarter as well how much of that is what is your win rate among the large teams do you feel like its getting better and how much is in the pipeline versus actually in the door i guess when i think about just as you win new mandates and new client and fas paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i dont know if i have those exact numbers i will say no we didnt see million teams a year or two to go now we see million and million teams that are the batting average is pretty good but theres a lot of competition were not the highest payer but were still doing really really well we have a lot in the door but right now well stay in the pipeline and im committed were in the middle of were right there neck and neck and were i think we have a pretty good read on who will come in or not or who are close and you stay at it so but its a large number and were actually honestly a little surprised i think its both the growth of our firm and our platform the high net worth initiatives that weve had and what weve built really since ph alex brown has joined us with their help being a place for people in the high net worth ultrahigh net worth feel very comfortable and then our technology and our systems and culture its all combined to add added to a place where frankly if youd have asked us a couple of years ago we would say that we wouldnt have told you ph we would have expected million million million teams multiple teams at one time so our job is to get them in the door right so the good ones and so thats what we work hard on operator your next question comes from the line of mark mclaughlin from bank of america your line is open mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc good evening guys thanks for taking my question for my first one i was curious how do you view your use of transition assistance and loans to financial advisors i know some of your competitors use that a lot in terms of generating growth how do you view your competitivity in that space paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah first everyone uses them so if you want to recruit with zero transition indiscernible i mean you might bring some people in but not much i mean advisors feel theres a value to their practices and want a fairer return on those so that is part of recruiting for all the firms not so much in the ria channel but certainly in the employee and independent channel weve consistently since my time and before have not been the highest on purpose and we want weve always said its part of selfselection that we want people to come because they believe its the right place not for the highest check now having said that in last few years transition assistance has gone up so weve had to make adjustments but i mean were rarely ever the highest offer i mean we rarely match the highest offer and we still have a very good batting average so but its part of the business operator your next question comes from a line of alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is open raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys thanks for taking the question paul i was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the comment you made earlier to bills point around building excess capital position in fact the last time you guys were at over tier leverage you went out and did a significant number of deals so maybe articulate a little bit more what the ma pipelines look like for the business today and what areas within raymond james look most interesting from an inorganic perspective thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah well honestly theres a lot of opportunities in all of our business segments we think theres an organic opportunity so the challenge is you just dont know some are on the market many we keep in touch with and say is this a good time for you to look at teaming with us versus competing with us and i think during the last year with everything going on discussions are up now when you can close those or when theyre actionable or and frankly in this market where you suffer a little bit from what our own ma business does that the sellers price expectations adjust much slower than the buyers do so just taken in our industry with cash sorting right weve always said conservatively wed expect cash starting to continue which it has over the last year and many people are saying well cash sorting is over and this should be our this should be the ebitda you value us on so we just say no we dont think so and so part of that sometimes solves over timing or part of that people say well at this valuation were not going to sell and that happens with all the segments but the number of dialogues are up the interest i mean sustained dialogue and some we walk from some they walk from some we just say hey maybe its not the right timing pricewise and that was no different than the dynamic a few years ago and then all of a sudden four we were after for a while and two came out of blue almost that we found all closed so we cant predict that timing and dont want to even try because there is nothing concrete to predict it but when theres enough activity you want to make sure you have enough capital that if that time does come that you could execute operator your next question comes from the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley your line is open michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening thanks for taking the question wanted to come back to some of your comments on the recruiting backdrop i was hoping you might be able to elaborate a bit on the competitive environment today versus say months or months ago for recruiting and how you might expect that to evolve if rates come down over the next year or two paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc recruiting my 15th year i think in this role i mean since ive been here everybody told me recruiting was going to slow down and its just picked up the aging advisor thered be been no more advisors left and we see teams in their that have bigger books than weve ever seen before so i think the recruiting potential is going to stay there i think we have a unique value proposition given our size on one hand with and our a ratings across the three rating agencies our capital on the other hand allowing independents and freedom advisors to own their raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 books so they can leave if they want to leave the technology platform and wealth we think is second to none and thats what the industry awards would say so you got to keep competing and it hasnt slowed down yet probably the biggest change the competitive landscape its been ria rollups that pay prices that we cant quite figure out and its a bit on aggregating and being able to go to market some point even though those private multiples are much higher than the public multiple so thats a new competitor which kind of led price now people are selling their firms versus having people still kind of owning their businesses so thats the newest dynamic and in an area which is i call a new competitor but again its the advisors choice right how do they want to practice if they want to own their business and get all the support of leading technology for a great place if they want to sell their business at a pretty high multiple to rollups so were trying to aggregate and monetize later i mean thats certainly a viable market option that wasnt really there for years operator there are no further questions at this time mr paul reilly i turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc all right i just want to thank you all for attending i think were in great shape with certainly good tailwinds with that asset number being up the markets maybe surprised us all continue to be robust but if they continue were in great shape there and the cash dynamic will sort itself at some time if the forward curve is right at all even if its delayed that will ultimately be a tailwind when that happens but right now we just as you know were conservative so we always look at it as i kid paul about this decline in the last few quarters we havent quite hit that yet and you get it again but we dont know so we try to be conservative and if rates do moderate or come in then that will get some tailwinds there for the industry so thanks for joining and well talk to you again
