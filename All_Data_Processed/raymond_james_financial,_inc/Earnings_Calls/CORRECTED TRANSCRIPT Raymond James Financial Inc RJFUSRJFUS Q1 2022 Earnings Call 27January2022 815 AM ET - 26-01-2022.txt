to chairman and ceo paul riley paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning and thanks for joining us today although our beloved buccaneers were slow out of the gate last sunday against some very strong competition not so for raymond james as we are off to a fantastic start its hard to believe the pandemic started in the us nearly two years ago when i think back on all of thats been accomplished since then im so proud of the way our associates and advisors have continue to serve their clients with great care and compassion living out our values each and every day beginning on slide our steadfast commitment to serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter starting off fiscal with record quarterly revenues and earnings that were propelled by record investment banking revenues and record asset management and related administrative fees in the private client group in the fiscal first quarter the firm reported record net revenues of billion and record net income of million or earnings per diluted share of a increase over diluted eps in the fiscal first quarter of excluding million of acquisition related expenses quarterly adjusted net income was million or earnings per diluted share of annualized return on equity for the quarter was and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was a very impressive result especially in this near zero rate environment and given our strong capital positions moving to slide we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of trillion up yearoveryear and sequentially we also achieved record pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion up sequentially record clients domestic cash sweep balances of billion and record financial assets under management of billion through our clientfocused culture and leading technology solutions we maintain our focus on supporting advisors and their clients as a result we continue to see strong results in terms of advisor retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisors to the raymond james platform through our multiple affiliation options over the trailing 12month period ending in december we recruited financial advisors with nearly million of trailing production and approximately billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels additionally we generated domestic pcg net new assets of approximately billion over the four quarters ending in december representing more than of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the period raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 first quarter domestic pcg net new asset growth was even stronger generating a nearly annualized rate the highest level we have experienced since starting to closely track this metric these results really highlight our industry leading organic growth we ended the quarter with financial advisors a net increase of over the prior year period and a net decrease of compared to the preceding quarter as many of you know in the last calendar quarter we generally see an elevated number of retirements and advisors choosing to leave the business and it was no different this year with approximately advisors falling into that category however when advisors retire they typically have succession plans and assets are usually retained by the firm so there is minimal impact to the production or asset levels clients domestic cash sweep balances grew sequentially to a record billion as paul will detail later in the call we should have significant upside to our pretax earnings in a rising interest rate environment also worth noting on this slide is the impressive loan growth at the raymond james bank during the quarter up sequentially to a record billion this growth was driven by securities based loans to pcg clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth moving to the segment results on slide the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million given the timing of certain expenses we think it is most appropriate to compare the yearoveryear results where the segments revenues increased and the pretax income increased over the first fiscal quarter of a truly fantastic growth the capital markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of million and record pretax income of million representing an impressive pretax margin to net revenues these record results were driven by record investment banking revenues including records for both ma and equity underwriting fixed income also generated solid results for the quarter the asset management segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million on a yearoveryear basis the revenues grew and pretax income grew over the first fiscal quarter of primarily driven by higher assets under management paul will discuss some of the sequential variances in the segment later on the call raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million representing solid sequential and yearoveryear growth net revenue growth was largely due to higher asset balances as the bank generated attractive growth in its securitiesbased lending portfolio up an astonishing over december of in addition to the growth in the residential mortgages and corporate loans pretax income growth was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and a bank loan loss release in the current quarter compared to a provision for credit losses in the comparative periods as macroeconomic conditions continue to improve these record results reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses before i hand the call over to paul ill take a moment to highlight the completion of the acquisition of the uk based charles stanley group earlier this month charles stanley adds approximately billion of client assets bringing raymond james total client assets to the uk to approximately billion we have long admired this firm and we are pleased to welcome charles stanley to the raymond james family and now for a more detailed review of our first quarter financial results ill turn the call over to paul shoukry paul raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks paul ill begin with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially record asset management fees grew over the preceding quarter i do want to touch on the sequential decline of asset management fees in the asset management segment during the quarter primarily due to a larger portion of certain client fees allocated to the private client group segment starting at the beginning of the fiscal year which effectively resulted in nearly million of managed account fees that shifted from the asset management segment to the private client group segment during the quarter this change is the primary driver of the asset management segments revenues and pretax income declining sequentially private client group assets in feebased accounts were up during the first fiscal quarter providing a nice tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal but there are fewer days in the fiscal second quarter so i expect somewhere around to sequential growth in this line item in the second quarter consolidated brokerage revenues of million grew over the prior year and sequentially with yearoveryear growth in the private client group segment and sequential growth in the private client group segment and the capital markets segment account and service fees of million increased yearover year and sequentially largely due to higher mutual fund and annuity service fees as well as client account fees in the private client group segment paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter so ill touch on other revenues other revenues of million were down compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to lower tax credit funds revenues which are typically highest in the fiscal fourth quarter gains on private equity investments also declined on a yearoveryear and sequential basis moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record billion up over the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets this growth in client cash balances should bode well for us in a rising interest rate environment which i will describe in more detail on the next slide turning to slide combined net interest income and bdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up from the preceding quarter this growth is largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at raymond james bank which held flat at for the quarter average yields on the bank loan portfolio actually increased slightly this quarter which was fantastic to see however an increase in lower yielding cash balances kept the banks net interest margin flat we expect the banks nim to remain relatively stable at current interest rates and we expect a nice tailwind for net interest income going into the next quarter given the strong growth of loans at raymond james bank but net interest income will also be impacted by fewer days in the fiscal second quarter related to loans based on your feedback we have added ending period loan balances by category in our supplemental earning schedule we hope you find this update helpful and as always thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures the average yield of rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks tick lower to basis points in the quarter reflecting the low interest rate environment and a limited demand for cash from thirdparty banks i want to provide an update to the interest rate sensitivity from what we provided last may during our analyst and investor day raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 as of december clients domestic cash sweep balances were billion given our high concentration of floating rate assets that are funded with these cash balances we should have significant upside from increases in shortterm interest rates using these static balances and an instantaneous 100basis point increase in shortterm interest rates we would expect incremental pretax income of approximately million per year with approximately of that reflected as net interest income and reflected as account and service fees this scenario assumes a blended deposit beta of around for the first 100basis point increase commensurate with what we experienced in the last rate cycle moving to consolidated expenses on slide first our largest expense compensation the compensation ratio for the quarter of was wellbelow our target and close to the compensation ratio we achieved in fiscal helped by record investment banking revenues as explained on the prior calls while our compensation ratio target is or lower in this near zero shortterm interest rate environment we have demonstrated we can manage below that target closer to to when the capital markets segment generates at or near these record levels of revenues and of course well likely have to revisit this target if interest rates start increasing noncompensation expenses of million decreased sequentially primarily driven by the bank loan loss reserve release this quarter as well as lower professional fees as you can see in these results we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation related expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring very high service levels for advisors and their clients however as we discussed last quarter we expect expenses to increase throughout this fiscal year as we continue investing in people and technology to support our tremendous growth as business development expenses increase with travel and conferences resuming and as net loan growth drives higher associated bank loan loss provisions for credit losses for example you can see our communications and information processing expenses increased yearoveryear as we continue to make critical investments in technology we would expect the yearoveryear growth for this line item to be right around this level for the full year in fiscal slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters while our pretax margin target in this near zero shortterm interest rate environment is around weve generated a pretax margin of in the fiscal first quarter or on an adjusted basis boosted by record revenues particularly for investment banking still relatively subdued business development expenses and the loan loss release during the quarter we will probably have to revisit our pretax margin and compensation ratio target at our analyst and investor day scheduled in may if we start seeing increases in shortterm interest rates hopefully by then we will also have more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for investment banking revenues the level of business development expenses travel and conferences resume more fully and the impact of recently closed and pending acquisition on slide at the end of the quarter total assets were approximately billion an sequential increase reflecting solid growth of loans at raymond james bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances that were accommodating on the balance sheet liquidity and capital remain very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion increasing during the quarter the total capital ratio of and the tier leverage ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters in december the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to per share per quarter which is not reflected on this chart raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 until next quarter the board also authorized share repurchases of up to billion which replaced the previous authorization as of january all billion remained available under this authorization due to regulatory restrictions following our pending acquisition of tristate capital holdings we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing but we believe this authorization signals our intention to repurchase the associated shares soon after closing in the meantime we expect our capital and our share count to continue growing between now and closing lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve criticized loans declined and nonperforming assets remained low at just basis points the bank loan loss reserve release of million was primarily driven by improving macroeconomic assumptions used in the cecl models the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined from in the preceding quarter to at quarter end for corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul overall im extremely pleased with our strong start to fiscal we are wellpositioned entering the second fiscal quarter with strong capital ratios records for all our key business metrics including client assets client domestic cash sweep balances and strong activity level for the financial advisor recruiting and investment banking in the private client group segment results will benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with an sequential increase of assets in feebased account which should result in a to increase in asset management fees given two fewer days in the second quarter additionally based on our robust recruiting pipelines we hope to continue our recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology platforms i cant promise well be able to sustain the net new asset growth we achieved over the last months or the phenomenal annualized net new assets we experienced in the fiscal first quarter but given our strong retention and continued interest in all of our affiliation options im optimistic we will continue delivering leading organic growth numbers in the capital markets segment the investment banking pipeline remains very strong for the next quarter or two but given all the uncertainties in the market we really dont have much visibility for the second half of the year at this point we do know we have a much stronger team than we had five years ago and we have gained market share so our productive capacity has certainly grown but what i cant tell you is what will happen to the markets and activity levels across the industry to months from now we also expect solid fixed income brokerage results over the next quarter or two driven by demand from depository client segment which is still flush with cash and searching for yield optimization opportunities that we do a fantastic job in helping our clients in the asset management segment as equity markets remain resilient we expect results will be positively impacted by the higher financial assets under management which continues to be driven by the strong growth of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment and raymond james bank should continue to grow as well have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet we will continue to focus on lending to the private client group segment through securitiesbased loans and mortgages and we will remain selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan portfolio also as previously mentioned we should experience significant tailwinds in a rising interest rate environment finally i want to thank all our advisors and our associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients these results are a testament to their hard work and everyone in the raymond james family with that operator will you please open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and the first question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc good morning paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so i was wondering if you can unpack your comments on the net interest income and the sensitivity to higher rates i know you said million addition to pretax income nii account and service fees but does that assume a flat balance sheet and cib balances staying flat and also thirdparty deposits staying flat or so is there basically more upside to these numbers given the loan growth that youre generating and also the upcoming acquisition of tristate paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc no youre absolutely right that is a static analysis based on current balances and so we do have upside going forward as we continue growing the balance sheet at raymond james bank and also as we hopefully close the tristate capital acquisition so we have some good tailwinds in a rising rate environment raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it so then maybe i can push a little bit on your pretax margin comments i know youre not giving any targets right now but maybe you can help us think through it so if i look at your quarter right now youre running at a pretax margin if i normalize for provisions and business development cost maybe you get to and then if capital markets revenue is elevated maybe that gets you down to when those normalized and your comment of million if im doing the math right suggest theres percentage points to percentage points upside to the margin so should we expect that as we get through this rate hike cycle your margin can go up to in this cycle paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean were not ready to come out with a new target at this juncture but because as you point out there are a lot of moving parts but you are correct that the million on todays revenues would equate to somewhere around basis points to basis points of benefit but i think the some of the other factors that we have to consider is sort of normalized business development what capital markets revenues look like going forward so there are some other puts and takes and variables to consider as we get more clarity but with that being said if you look at where we were in the last rate cycle we had higher a pretax margin target before rates were cut to zero and so we obviously have upside and tailwinds from higher rates manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning paul and paul hope you guys are doing well paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with just a question on tristate capital at the time of the merger you had guided paul to about accretion from the deal and if memory serves that only assumed two rate hikes through that assumption certainly feels conservative given the forward curve reflecting close to eight hikes exiting and i was hoping you could just provide some updated expectations for tsc accretion or the incremental sensitivity if we do get additional rate hikes raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 and then just speak to your philosophy around how much of that nii windfall from higher rates would you expect to fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested in the business paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean as far as the synergy guidance that we provided upon announcement that if my memory serves me correctly i think it was percentage accretion not really factoring in any rate hikes at all and then maybe an additional basis points to basis points with the rate projections that you just mentioned so to your point the rate increases are look like theyre coming faster than we anticipated at that point in time so to the extent they have a floating highly floating rate balance sheet locked in securities based loans of their loans are in securities based loans that are floating and so to your point there is more upside if rates increase faster than we originally anticipated steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats great color paul and just for my followup and itll a bit of a pointed question on organic growth i mean your headline organic growth is the highest of any of the public companies that have reported so far thats coming in at an impressive trailing months annualized in the quarter at the same time the reported aum when we go through the benchmarking exercise the growth of quarteronquarter is virtually identical to peers that are growing at half your stated organic growth rate and it just also appears a little bit light relative to the gains that we saw in the sp of about in the quarter and i was hoping you could just speak to the stronger organic growth why its not necessarily translating into a higher level of aum growth granted one quarter does not a trend make and any differences youre just aware of in terms of how you run the organic growth calculation relative to what some of your peers might be doing paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah as far as we can tell steve we are calculating most of the peers are calculating the organic growth calculation similarly we track that pretty closely so we have been generating as you said leading organic growth if you look at our net new asset metrics and if you look at our asset growth over time which weve been saying for a very long time even before we started producing net new assets our asset growth is the best in the industry as well and as you point out those two are correlated so from quartertoquarter sometimes its hard to tell but if you look at it over one three fiveyear period or any period of time our asset growth on an organic basis has been leading in the industry sometimes you have to factor in acquisitions or big program hires or something like this but certainly the net new asset and the asset growth has been amongst the best and in certain quarters the best certain years the best in the industry steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc its great color paul thanks so much for taking my questions operator and our next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please proceed raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey thanks good morning guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc want to come back on the interest rate outlook and some of the moving parts here if we look at the cash balances you saw a really nice step up in the quarter and big spike in december as well im just curious was that just kind of year end selling or was it because of the strong ma or some seasonality i know there can sometimes be some seasonality in there so really just trying to understand like how sticky you think that kind of step function ph higher was in the quarter and then also in terms of deposit betas you absolutely have some good recent history of how things trended and it was quite a bit better than i think expectations heading into the prior tightening cycle how are you guys thinking about maybe competitive threats or just competitive dynamics with fintech being a lot larger today than it was four or five years ago and many of those firms are kind of signaling that theyre going to pass the majority of the benefit through to customers does that play in or do you not look at them necessarily as direct competitors when youre thinking about cash and deposit rates paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good question devin i think theres a few things first you have to remember client cash is only of assets so its not a high percentage typically for most periods were closer to so clients are still pretty invested so part of that with the market growth obviously the equities grow versus the cash but so the client cash has been very sticky in terms of the portfolio certainly not overweighted but also because of our recruiting we bring a lot of cash in when people move over their clients are allocated somewhere to cash so that continues to grow and our recruiting is just doing great were still full guns on it so i think thats were pretty comfortable with that cash i think its almost the opposite if theres a correction during this interest rate period we see a lot more cash generated but we havent seen any unusual movements so as a percent of asset still pretty low probably driven more with us by just our success in recruiting paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah as far as your deposit beta question there are more fintechs now than there were three years ago but there are a lot of high yield accounts available online three years ago as well yeah so maybe offsetting factor is that unlike the last rate cycle the banking system is extremely flush with cash now maybe more so well definitely more so than it was in the last rate cycle raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 so theres some puts and takes we are assuming in our 570million pretax upside deposit beta which is commensurate with what we saw on the last rate cycle we think thats conservative but it could be lower or higher than that for the first hundred basis points depending on those factors paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we find clients typically during these increases if we go through history that its got to be over base rate before they can start looking at it so we have a long way to go from basis point certainly and the early going is in fintechs can offer one but theres not really many place to park them very liquidly at that rate so i dont think i think the first hundred basis points is a pretty safe assumption probably conservative given the history on the first hundred basis points and after that as rates go higher then there is the game is on but i think the early raise is a pretty safe assumption devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes okay terrific that all makes sense so just to follow up here with charles stanley closed maybe if you can just talk a little bit more about plans to accelerate growth and investments and kind of the uk wealth management platform i know its still very small but how we should just think about kind of the trajectory there and maybe your enthusiasm for the potential for additional growth outside the us paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so i think that its just closed a few days now so were just really starting to talk about integration and that takes some time but its a great franchise if it was constrained it was constrained by capital a little bit familycontrolled and for a good reason they didnt want to dilute their position where they were so i think those are off because we have plenty of capital to fuel it and generally when people join you the first thing we always focus on is retention and weve had a pretty good track record i think thatll be very positive there too and we need to get everybody settled down in the seat positive of the story i will tell you that ive of all the ones weve ever done and we have tristate still pending but who has a great cultural fit this is the were hearing very little noise from the advisors they think it makes sense and they think its good for them we will invest we do have some technology that they can use some of the other things so but its going to take a good year or so to really get through that integration but we would expect where we have one of the leading growth firms in the uk with rjis our independent we think that we can really step up the growth as is charles stanley management with the capital and the ability to recruit in the story so were confident but i wouldnt expect anything significant this year devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great if i can just squeeze one more in here just on the administrative and incentive comp kind of trajectory how should we think about that relative to revenue growth across the business meaning is there some leverage there or is revenues potentially continue to accelerate that that will track ahead just trying think about some of the puts and takes there raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah no devin as you know we are always focused on trying to realize operating leverage in the business and growing revenues faster than expenses and theres always noise quarter to quarter especially when youre comparing a fiscal yearend quarter with the beginning of the fiscal year on a linked basis but if you step back in fiscal in the pcg business we grew the administrative and incentive comp by but with revenues in that business growing so that was really significant operating leverage and thats kind of continuing in this quarter with yearover year growth in revenues versus yearoveryear growth in administrative compensation expense so to your point we have always been focused and were still focused on realizing that operating leverage as revenue grows devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes okay terrific thank you guys operator and our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning guys maybe just to follow up on the compensation question for the if i look at fa payouts as a percent of compensable revenue it seems like it went up yearoveryear i know that can move around but just is there any kind of pressure on compensation given just competition or salary wage inflation or is that just bouncing around but it just seemed like it went up about basis points yearoveryear paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah the financial adviser payouts are on the grid and so in the employee channel and both in the independent contractor channel so as you noted that does tend to bounce around basis points basis points from any quarter when youre comparing it on a quartertoquarter basis there are benefits that are accrued in there and other things its not just direct payout that you would see on the grid so it can bounce around from quarter to quarter but were not expecting a meaningful step up based on the mix of advisors we have in our independent and employee channel paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah we have not changed really we havent raised the payouts and there are higher payouts and higher production for some so you get a little bit of that impact but its really i think just more of a bouncing around effect than it is any change here james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay so no change in the grid okay thats helpful and just maybe on the tsc deal as you get closer to it do you feel like theres an opportunity to really invest to expand that more rapidly should we expect some raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 investment spending around that business or is it really just hey standalone we think they can grow with just a little more incremental capital dont need a ton of investment spend paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think theyre if you look at their own releases we dont were still in the middle of the shareholder they had a very very good they have very good growth and yeah i think what youll see is us just giving them a little more capital and maybe to accelerate technology and to help serve their clients and we may get some synergies over time on compliance and those kind of functions but outside of that theyll be operating alone theyll have a little more capital and their growth rates are very good were kind of very pleased historically and their current release was very very good so we certainly dont need them growing faster than they are i mean theyre growing well and i think its going to be more of our balance sheet deployment the use of our cash and theyre going to do their thing and serve their clients so james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right okay great thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of bill katz with citigroup please proceed william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking my questions this morning so just picking up on tsc so i appreciate the upside with the higher rates but then they did have a strong fourth quarter for we could tell as well how does the fourth quarter trend relative to your baseline accretion of as you sort of think about when this closes and any update on when you think the deal itself may close paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah we kind of gave you some assumptions when we announced the transaction we use conservative assumptions when we do any kind of investment or make any kind of investment and certainly the level of growth that theyve achieved in the fourth quarter again theyre a separate public company so i dont want to speak about their results but to your point i dont think you would call those conservative i mean theyve been generating really strong growth and so ill just leave it at that in terms of timing its all contingent on regulatory approvals and so we hope to get it done in calendar but again thats dependent on the regulatory approvals and right now paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and the shareholder vote paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 and shareholder yeah paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc at the end of february so yeah william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay great just as a followup coming back to business development for a moment any update on how youre thinking about sort of the glide path in fiscal and so that endpoint number of million is sort of the exit this year relative to what you sort of guided to last quarter thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i wouldnt say the 200million was a guide it was just a reference point for where we were precovid that would have been million a quarter we are right around million this quarter and we actually were able to have an advisor conference this quarter for the employee channel so i would be very surprised most of the things here in the second quarter weve postponed and pushed back unfortunately due to the covid spread i would be very surprised if we are able to even exit the year at the million run rate per quarter unfortunately and i say unfortunately because we really do want to get back to traveling again to having the advisor recognition trips and the conferences so i think thats kind of the glide path is probably longer a flatter glide path than we thought this time last quarter unfortunately william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking the questions operator and our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good morning guys just maybe picking up on that last point you guys are generating fantastic organic growth for this quarter over the last months and thats really without spending a lot on things like conferences and your promotional expense to your point paul has been running well below where you guys were back in so lessons learned from the pandemic being you guys can still achieve significant growth without spending as much why is that not the right passage from sort of here paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc theres certainly lessons learned i mean we were going to a flexible work environment before the pandemic so certain lessons were kind of reinforced we could do it but we think its important to get people back in the office and were making great progress but obviously with the holidays and since weve been conservative as the cases have been up raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 but the big part of a lot of those conferences people think theyre just kind of fun trips theyre very educational the advisors get a lot of training and develop a lot of it on courses that they do and its important culturally so i think advisors understand why weve had to cancel or cut back on it during the pandemic but they wouldnt understand if things going back to normal that they would just disappear so we certainly have learned you can do a lot of things with less travel theres a lot of things that require that facetoface input and frankly we all know it from our own firms theres a lot of people are tired of not being together and not seeing each other and interacting even though they like the flexibility so we got to find that balance but the conferences are important culturally theyre important to get people together keeps their bond with the firm and for training development i mean theres a lot of facets and they do cost money but just as the investor conferences of many of people in this firm will start back up postcovid some have been able to sneak some in but you do them for the same reason and so are we alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right makes sense my second one is really just a followup and im sorry if i missed it i think steve asked the question around just the kind of assumptions around reinvestment spend on the back of the higher rates and the tailwinds you guys are going to get from obviously materially higher revenues on the back of high interest rates so should we think about an acceleration in investment spend and things outside of comp as rates go higher paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we dont have anything planned i mean were going to well have the same pressures on technology and what are we going to spend were going to have as we grow support will have to grow were spending a lot of time automating the back office so there are things that cost money theres been comp pressure in the industry we havent i dont think felt it as weve felt it but it hasnt been as grave as a lot of other people have said its been or people leaving our turnover isnt up very much and again i think thats culturally and we pay people well off a good year so i dont see any big initiatives i think three or four years ago we had a huge initiative to kind of redo the whole compliance infrastructure and back office and systems and gear up but youre seeing the leverage of that now where those arent really going up commensurate with revenues so we dont have any major plans i dont know what wed change over the next three or four years im sure therell be investment initiatives but nothing like we had three or four years ago alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thats right all right perfect thanks very much paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks alex operator and our next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please proceed raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning maybe just one on the afs book the growth there slowed a bit in the quarter just wondering if you could comment on your appetite to reaccelerate the growth there given the recent move weve seen really in the belly of the curve paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah were keeping an eye on it we do plan on growing it modestly throughout the year but were trying to position ourselves for the increase in shortterm rates so taking four to five years of duration because theres not a lot of three to fouryear paper out there thats available the fed is still buying but to take the four to five years of duration for is not overly compelling in a rising rate environment so were trying to preserve as much flexibility as possible we do have a preference for being more exposed to the short end of the curve the really short end of the curve and so i think were being kind of deliberate and patient as we always are paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and i think also we were we debated when we knew rates were falling whether it was the lock in and we thought were just better off longterm with a floating balance sheet so now that we see all predictions are rates will rise you never know its kind of a its kind of the wrong time to abandon that if you believe that rates are really going up and youre going to get a bunch of raises in the next year as people are predicting now so were not we are investing and growing the securities book but were not going to raise to do it because we think within a year well look back and say gosh we probably shouldnt have done that so kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood and if i could just ask a followup earlier to a question that was asked on the administrative compensation in the pcg segment you mentioned that it only grew last year despite growth in the segment revenue and now weve seen that accelerate to yearoveryear growth in the first quarter here im just trying to get a sense of this indiscernible acceleration in this line for the full fiscal year if theres anything to really note in that line in terms of seasonality in the fiscal first quarter and then if you could just maybe just give an update in terms like the mediumterm outlook for that administrative compensation line for pcg is it right to think about that line as being kind of a midsingle digit growth line over time on a normalized basis if you could just comment there thatd be great thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah theres a lot of factors theres a lot of items that go into that line i mean theres of course seasonality as there is with most compensationrelated line items but one of the line one of the factors that goes into it is just the accruals for benefits which are based on profitability growth so youre going to see growth in that line with the growth in profitability raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 and as paul says we have been very generous in terms of compensation to our associates we have a long track record of sharing the success of the firms with our associates and with our fiscal year end being in september this line now reflects the salary and bonus increases that we gave at the end of our fiscal year end youll start seeing that probably for most of our peers starting next quarter so i think this is theres a lot of factors that go into it but as i said earlier were really focused on realizing the operating leverage going forward kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator and the last question comes from the line of chris allen with compass point please proceed christopher allen q analyst compass point research trading llc hey morning everyone most of my questions have been answered already i guess just a quick one just on the client cash balances obviously helped by net new asset growth and indiscernible percent of assets im just wondering if you see any typically seasonality there towards the end of the calendar year and any commentary just on any shift in the risk appetite from a client perspective to start this year just given where the markets are paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah as paul said really the fluctuation in cash balances the extreme fluctuations really are more dependent on market movements we have seen some end of calendar year buildup of cash over history over time and then of course as we get to the tax season in april some of that cash gets used to pay taxes but i would say that the growth that we saw this quarter was really due to the fantastic organic growth that paul was describing earlier paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you look at client sentiment i think the most recent its been pretty flat with last quarter at about half are confident in the stock market good news is are still confident in their advisors so i think in an uncertain times people arent going to rush to invest cash versus three or four years ago when youre in the middle of a run it looks like its continuing to run people are more likely to invest so i dont see any pressure for that number to really go down i dont see a rush for them to put money into the equity market and again as a percent of assets its lower than historical so i think were doing well there so i wouldnt expect any fluctuations you never know right so the market is dynamic but i think were in good shape christopher allen q analyst compass point research trading llc thanks guys paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 all right so id like to thank everybody for joining i believe that not only do we have fantastic quarter all the indications recruiting is strong we have upside on interest rates our pipelines in investment banking are very strong its hard to give ive been around too long or i see ma come and go depending on market conditions if you had a really sharp drop in rate or equity markets that certainly could impact it but in a normal state thats in great shape and as long as we continue to first retain our advisors and have them do the great job they continue to have done this last year and last quarter and our recruiting momentum is extremely strong its a it feels good to start the calendar year where we are hopefully covid gets through the system and we can have more of a normal life and but it was a good quarter and i think were wellpositioned going forward so i appreciate you joining us this morning thank you operator thank you that does conclude the call for today we thank you for your participation have a great day
