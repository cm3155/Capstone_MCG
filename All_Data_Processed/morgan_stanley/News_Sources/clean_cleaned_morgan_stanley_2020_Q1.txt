morgan stanley  morgan stanley s takeover of etrade financial corp for billion shows how drastically the brokerage industrys business model has changed firms no longer want to offer investment products from all sources instead they want to milk their customers cash and manage all of the assets themselves investors need to understand the rules of the new game morgan stanley etrade and schwab all own banks to which they route much of their customers cash etrade pays its customers to on their uninvested cash morgan stanley to schwab to brokerages have been pocketing and up on that money and you can do almost as well if you pull the cash from your brokerage account and park it in a certificate of deposit or savings account at the right online bank there is a lot to like about morgan stanley s most ambitious foray beyond wall street but there isnt yet a lot to bank on morgan stanley paid a hefty price for growth and stability by acquiring etrade financial for billion in stock about billion above where the discount broker closed on wednesday morgan stanley will likely dilute its tangible book value by roughly the question is whether the firm can earn it back from an overall strategic standpoint the deal is fairly straightforward morgan stanley for years has been moving more heavily into wealth management and the notable piece it was missing was a truly massmarket retail program etrade known for its onlinetrading platform brings that it has over five million individualinvestor accounts and a brand that isnt out of place in a roster of super bowl commercials like other wealthmanagement businesses its revenue isnt nearly as volatile as investment banking and trading and it can grow steadily in a wider array of market conditions that latter feature is especially important when morgan stanley is being put through the annual federal reserve stress tests still given the premium paid and the dilution the deal merits further scrutiny etrade may no longer generate as much in juicy trading commissions in the era of zero pricing but it still brings loads of customer cash billion of deposits in its own bank and billion swept offbalancesheet by using those offbalancesheet deposits to replace wholesale funding at morgan stanley this can help reduce funding costs by million by year two unfortunately the bulk of etrade s deposits arent so readily available to be redeployed for one thing morgan stanley says it has only so much business that can be depositfunded though it is rapidly expanding its lending book also etrade s own core business needs to fund margin loans an intimate part of why people trade with it so further fundingcost arbitrage gains will take time overall considering both the funding gains and an additional million in expense savings by year three morgan stanley forecasts an improvement to its return on tangible common equity of percentage point or more that additional earnings power will most likely cover the dilutive outcome of the stock deal whether there is significantly more upside to the stock is something investors will have to figure out on their own a few possibilities stand out the biggest is that etrade brings a workplace stockplan business that will complement morgan stanley s shareworks which it built up by acquiring solium last year morgan stanley has said it could add another million active clients through this channel now that number gets even bigger etrade also is building its independent adviser custody business a big growth area for its onlinebrokerage rivals morgan stanley s own adviserdriven business has tools to accelerate that effort etrade and morgan stanley can also now jointly build out a digital retailbanking offering to compete with the likes of goldman sachs group s marcus and fintech upstarts such as betterment there is one additional possibility if the deal succeeds in greatly expanding the firms steady feegeneration capabilities across its wealth business book value might just not matter as much any more to investors shifting the valuation conversation to a forward priceearnings ratio on that basis morgan stanley sits at about times well short of charles schwab s more than times an outcome like that is hardly assured but with this deal at least it is in the realm of the possible
