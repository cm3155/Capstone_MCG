without our consent i will now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning everyone and thank you for joining us as you all know over the past decade weve dramatically transformed our business model weve grown the contribution of more durable balance sheetlight sources of revenue investing in wealth management and investment management while maintaining our leadership position and taking share across our integrated investment bank the intention has been to provide stability to our firm in times of serious stress and to provide strength and value to our clients in times of volatile and active markets the environment for the second quarter provided exactly that test the covid health crisis economic collapse and a tremendous surge in unemployment massive fiscal and monetary stimulus operating with of employees working from home extraordinary client financing demand an increase in corporate defaults and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 bankruptcies and record market volumes against this extremely challenging backdrop im very proud of my colleagues the way they managed to support our clients and risk manage massive uncertainty all while working from home the results we announced this morning build on a very strong relative performance of the first quarter with a recordbreaking second quarter revenues of billion exceeded our best quarter ever by we delivered record net income of billion and an rotce of excluding a discrete tax item with an expense efficiency ratio of the stability of our platform in the face of recordbreaking volumes and a surge in capital raising from clients was critical our revenues of course benefited from this record activity but the rotce is a function of very strong operating leverage with a high degree of expense discipline in the face of significant macro headwinds as importantly our credit costs were relatively limited this is by design as we have virtually no unsecured consumer loans we do not have significant emerging market exposure and we have modest exposure to the small business segment each of our businesses contributed meaningfully to the results but the standout was institutional securities for the postcrisis period isg had record revenues of billion and record equity underwriting record debt underwriting record equity sales and trading and record fixed income sales and trading fixed income in particular was the standout in wealth management despite the impact of rates on net interest income and some integration costs relating to etrade our margin was over we saw clients continue to consolidate assets with our advisors deposit growth and loan growth investment management also performed exceptionally well with record and industryleading longterm flows as well as growth across all asset classes geographies and investor segments assets now are billion up from approximately billion at the beginning of so what does the future hold clearly it will be challenging for the back half of to meet the record first half results and we expect advisory and macro trading to be significantly lower that said many parts of our business should continue to perform well let me touch on the ccar exam and our scb results this year the new scb results confirmed what we have believed for many years that we carry significant excess capital we still believe that our ppnr is understated and we will continue to work with the regulators to better calibrate the models to the realities of our business our excess capital position allows us significant flexibility to continue to support our clients invest in our business grow our balance sheet and continue to pursue inorganic opportunities in our target areas in the nearterm we remain committed to our quarterly dividend of over time we expect to reinstate our buyback and increase our dividend subject of course to regulatory approvals lets turn to etrade i remain as confident if not more so about the strategic benefit to morgan stanley from this transaction among many positives it delivers it gives us strong digital capabilities a platform for international expansion a worldclass workplace business and will further enhance our cet1 ratio before turning to jon let me touch on the recent events affecting the black community particularly in this country but also in many places around the world it is clear that the racial injustice that has existed in our society for a very long time has not been resolved we at morgan stanley want to be part of the solution as part of our continuing efforts in this area weve recently added a commitment to diversity and inclusion as our fifth core value and made a number of other structural and financial decisions to materially enhance the opportunities provided to our diverse employees we will be doing more in the coming quarters to ensure that our morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 employee population mirrors the broader society in which we operate and live in and well provide detail around our recently announced institute of inclusion so let me now turn the call over to jon who will discuss the results of the quarter in greater detail thank you jonathan pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you and good morning in the second quarter firm net revenues were billion with net income applicable to morgan stanley of billion the quarter included an intermittent net discrete tax expense of million which impacted eps by excluding this item net income was billion and eps was also excluding this item our roe and rotce were and respectively and our yeartodate basis rotce was as part of our decadelong business transformation we have taken a highly integrated approach to client coverage our business segments and divisions work together to deliver a wide range of solutions and the firms intellectual capital to our clients this longterm coordinated approach has allowed us to provide a deeper level of service and stronger partnerships with our clients and has positioned us for our results this year throughout we remain disciplined around our expenses working diligently to manage down our efficiency ratio and our fixed cost base this quarter illustrates the significant operating leverage in the model especially in institutional securities quarteroverquarter isg revenues was up over billion while noncompensation expenses were down over million our firm efficiency ratio was in the quarter high levels of client activity led to elevated transactionrelated expenses which were offset by a dramatic reduction in marketing and business development and continued discipline around professional services costs we continue to support our employees and communities through these challenging times through financial equipment medical and other means of support we remain focused on opportunities to work smarter and more efficiently we have learned a lot about our organization and its cost structure through this period and we will leverage that learning to continue to optimize how and where we work and how we use our technology now to the businesses institutional securities reported revenues of billion a postfinancial crisis record and nearly billion higher than the prior best quarter record results were realized across various businesses products and regions our integrated investment bank benefited from our coordinated and clientfocused approach we saw significant demand for our leading research and bankers to help clients navigate these uncertain markets corporate clients took the opportunity to raise capital and liquidity and sales and trading investors actively repositioned their portfolios given the rapidly changing environment robust underwriting volumes also contributed to increased levels of sales and trading activities investment banking generated revenues of billion increasing from the prior quarter underwriting drove the results delivering its strongest performance in over a decade from a geographical perspective all regions saw a sequential improvement with particularly strong results in the americas advisory revenues increased from last quarter to million benefiting from higher completed ma industry volumes driven by an increase in larger transactions yeartodate announced industry volumes are down over and we expect ma to remain muted until there is more clarity on the path of the recovery and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 stability in prices however ceos and boards are engaged and strategic dialogue is integrated into our client discussions equity underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior quarter to million driven by increases across products followons converts blocks and ipos issuance accelerated in the latter two months of the quarter global equity volumes were the highest in nearly a decade as clients bolstered their balance sheets and monetized equity stakes the quarter saw a record convertible issuance as near zero interest rates and elevated volatility led issuers to favor equitylinked instruments fixed income underwriting revenues were million up from the prior quarter driven by bond issuance global highyield new issue volumes in june represented the highest ever recorded investment grade market also saw record issuance volumes activity has been driven by a combination of companies looking to fortify their balance sheets and others taking advantage of the very constructive financing environment after unprecedented levels of capitalraising issuance levels are likely to slow from the current torrid pace as we enter the summer pipelines remain healthy particularly ipos and if markets remain constructive we would expect active issuance in the latter part of this year equity sales and trading revenues increased sequentially to billion strong performance in cash and derivatives as well as a rebound in prime brokerage balances contributed to results cash and derivative revenues were the highest in over a decade driven by strong trading results across regions as we continued to help our clients navigate through this period of unprecedented uncertainty in cash in the face of historic volumes we executed for clients and helped keep markets open and functioning and in derivatives the results were strong across product types prime brokerage results were resilient and in line with the prior quarter balances rose significantly from march lows as market levels trended up and certain clients relevered although second quarter average balances were about below the first quarter fixed income sales and trading had its best quarter in over years excluding the impact of dva with robust performance across all major businesses and geographies revenues of billion increased from the strong first quarter results were particularly high in april as macro benefited from elevated volatility and wider bidoffer spreads and credit markets retraced much of their first quarter movements clients were especially active in the beginning of the quarter and remained engaged throughout though market spreads normalized and volatility abated we continue to see improvement in client penetration as we gain mindshare especially amongst leading asset managers micro revenues increased significantly driven by securitized products and credit corporates macro performance was strong across products though declined versus the robust prior quarter commodity results also remained strong benefiting from continued elevated levels of market volatility in oil and metals across other sales and trading and other revenues results improved dramatically from the first quarter the three main drivers across these lines include investments associated with deferred cashbased compensation or dcp performance of our billion held for sale portfolio and our provision for credit losses for our billion held for investment loans the sum of these components was approximately million this quarter versus a negative billion in the first quarter spreads tightened throughout the quarter leading to approximately a million gain on marktomarket of our held for sale portfolio net of losses on our hedges our provision for loan losses was million down from million in the first quarter and dcp swung positive this quarter as markets recovered our isg loans declined by approximately billion from the prior morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 quarter driven primarily by paydowns in our corporate and event book as clients took advantage of open and active capital markets to replace shortterm funding with longer term capital our funded ratio of corporate loans peaked at over of commitments in and now stands at our allowance for credit losses on loans increased to million which represents a build in our allowance over the quarter our loan book continues to perform well and we had no chargeoffs in the quarter currently weve approved less than billion of requests for principal and interest forbearance across isg loans as you can see in our new disclosure on page of the financial supplement our allowance for corporate loans increased to and our allowance for commercial real estate increased to across the entire held for investment portfolio our total allowance rose to now turning to wealth management second quarter revenues were billion dcp losses of approximately million from first quarter reversed almost entirely and prepayment amortization declined these factors drove the sequential increase in revenues pretax profits was billion and pretax profit margin was the underlying growth drivers remain strong on the heels of the technology and risk management of investments we have made client asset consolidation continues we increased retail asset capture and retention and lending penetration with our existing clients additionally net recruiting has materially improved transactional revenues were billion after excluding the impact of dcp transactional revenue was down versus the prior period reflecting a decline in client activity from the extremely high levels of the first quarter asset management revenues were billion down sequentially lower starting asset levels drove this decline lending growth in the first half of the year has been strong at over billion with balances of billion up versus the prior year driven by securities based lending and mortgages the loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well we saw mortgage forbearance remain stable at approximately of the portfolio and our 90day delinquencies are at basis points weve granted approximately billion of forbearance on commercial real estate loans in our tailored lending book each of which has personal guarantees from ultrahigh net worth clients we had less than basis point of net chargeoffs in our wealth lending book yeartodate and provision for loan losses of million was in line with last quarter net interest income was billion excluding the impact of prepayment amortization nii was relatively flat compared to prior quarter and exceeded our expectations the impact of lower rates was offset by elevated libor levels and spreads at the beginning of the quarter and higher lending and bdp balances we expect to see nii drift lower for the remainder of the year as libor and spreads have normalized growth in our lending businesses and higher levels of stable bank deposits should continue to offset some of the pressure from lower interest rates total us bank deposits were billion the meaningful increase in bank deposits that we saw in the first quarter was sustained and we continue to see bdp balances grow clients remain cautious as cash and short term securities levels remain over of total assets we expect to see an outflow for delayed tax payments total expenses were billion up sequentially the increase was driven by higher comp expenses principally related to dcp the solium integration and execution of our morgan stanley at work strategy are on track and are important precursors to our integration of etrade we continue to add new corporate clients approximately this year and since the announcement of the solium acquisition we continue to prepare for the expected closing of the etrade deal in the fourth quarter and have started to incur expenses in advance of the closing excluding these integration and acquisitionrelated morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 costs in the second quarter the margin would have been over these integration and acquisitionrelated expenses will likely erode the margin by to basis points this quarter as well after we close etrade these integration costs will be more substantial and we will provide further breakout at that time investment management revenues increased to million representing the second highest quarterly level in over a decade total aum rose to a record high billion of which longterm aum was billion longterm net flows were also a record at billion across strategies from a broad base set of global investors this equates to an annualized rate of total net flows were billion strong fund performance our deep global client partnerships and the power of our brand have driven this industryleading flow growth our clients are entrusting us with their assets we continue to deliver differentiated value to our clients across both public and private markets as well as through our global solutions capabilities our global active equity strategies continued to deliver significant outperformance and are attracting robust flows from institutions and wealth management clients both internationally and from the united states liquidity inflows remain strong with positive flows across strategies asset management fees of million increased sequentially driven by higher management fees on higher average aum investment revenues were million in the quarter the sequential increase was supported by the rebound in global markets we continue to invest in the investment management business and to focus and execute on multiple organic and inorganic growth opportunities to meet client needs turning to the balance sheet total spot assets rose to billion in line with the recovery in equity markets and high levels of client activity standardized rwas were flat at billion as an increase in market risk assets was offset by a decline in credit risk assets our standardized cet1 ratio rose basis points to compared to our recently announced scb of our board declared a dividend per share our tax rate was for the quarter excluding million of intermittent net discrete tax expense we continue to expect our fullyear core tax rate will be approximately to the second quarter illustrates that our strategy is working and highlights the power of our differentiated model we were at the forefront of serving our clients when they needed us most as for the operating outlook the dispersion of potential macro outcomes is high the path forward will largely be determined by the course of the covid pandemic the shape of the economic recovery and potential additional fiscal stimulus we continue to see reasonable client activity in the first few weeks of the quarter but would expect a reversion to more normalized levels as we head deeper into the summer aspects of the capital markets business will likely normalize and a rebound in ma activity will take some time in wealth we would expect to see continued momentum around new assets new clients and lending growth as we become a destination of choice for financial advisors in investment management our record flows will support fee growth and investment returns will depend on the macro environment we will continue to focus on what we can control serving our clients managing risk and controlling our expenses with that we will now open the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question and just a quick note that like the dfast results recent results certainly reflect the improvements and the resilience that you guys have made in the model and that must be a nice affirmation for all the hard work youve been putting in so congrats on that when we think about the wealth management business and the pretax margin how should we think about is it just backing out the million dcp from both revenue and comp and would that result then in the sort of core pretax margin being demonstrably higher and is it fair to say that just maybe the headwinds from the environment were not quite as profound as you anticipated and profitability in this business is going to be better as far as the outlook or is it not that simple james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley its sort of that simple firstly thank you for your kind comments to address the broader with the dfast scb numbers and these results and the upcoming closing on etrade assuming the shareholder vote happens which is imminent which i expect it will i clearly feel that we are at a different inflection point that weve been building towards for many years so these results affirm that and im sure well talk more about it on wealth management you can do brennan obviously you can do the math on the dcp which basically nets revenue against comp expense the wealth management margins the material change in those margins was the net interest income the change in rates and as we move to zero rates now you can have a view rates will be permanently zero in which case well have to do other things to enhance that business by the way etrade operates with margins around at the moment so with some of the restructuring that well be doing putting those two businesses together there clearly is margin enhancement opportunity just from that trade alone but in the last few months we had low market prices at the points where we price the fee income thats obviously improved we had a little bit of a rush of activity but we had not nearly as much because our clients are very stable and very feebased so in the wealth business what i look at is the fundamentals assets are growing flows are growing feebased flows are growing loan book is growing deposits are growing advisor attrition is basically zero were attracting net advisors were consolidating etrade were opening up some international growth platforms weve got a lot of opportunity to make the business more efficient and more technologydriven and interest rates will look after themselves at some point so i remain extremely optimistic about the business brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you for that i appreciate that james and following up on that when we think about nii jon i think you had said you expect it to drift lower but is it that the impact turned out to be a little bit more muted than you all expected and this is the right jumpingoff point with a more modest headwind from here or is there was there some onetime noise in the quarter around nii within the wealth business morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley no i think its as i said in my prepared remarks brennan the performance is better than we expected if you recall in the first quarter we thought that the impact of all the rate cuts we sort of tried to size that for you and its performed better the primary drivers are as i said the elevated libor now thats normalized and so thats why im suggesting that the nii is going to drift lower i think the first two quarters if you eliminate the prepayments have been pretty neutral and stable in terms of nii and that normalization is going to cause the drifting down slightly of the nii going forward and then it should be stabilized what we are seeing is that some of that loss that we expected we picked up in terms of just the balances both the lending balances and the excess deposit balances have abated some of those headwinds so its better than we expected but still clearly impacted by the zero rate environment james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and just to build on that we cant control the nii obviously very little given where rates are but what we did see and what i saw in the last financial crisis those institutions that are strong and stable attract flows disproportionately in the last crisis we were obviously not that institution and we were in fact losing flows not dramatically but we certainly werent adding and we were losing a little bit on the margin this crisis the reverse is happening were attracting positive flows and significant and positive fa talent and thats just a function of strength and stability so i think that behooves very well for the future of that particular business operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so i heard you loud and clear on the first couple of weeks reasonable activity and expect the summer to settle in i do think were still at a volatility level thats almost double like last year so it might settle in at a higher level im not asking you to comment on that but i do want you to comment on the ficc franchise obviously the world changed and lots of repositioning happened but youre way over where you used to think your expected quarterly levels will be so what i do want to ask is what have you noticed on the client front in terms of the coverage taking on new clients client wallet penetration because we havent seen everybodys results but i think these results show you taking share in a great quarter great quarter for everybody but taking share despite that jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i think its really a little of everything every business contributed weve riskmanaged extremely well and recognize the team now has been working together for about three years theyre really working well i commented about some progress we continue to make in mindshare of our fid clients particularly around asset managers in penetrating those accounts through the coordinated approach so its been a really strong set of sort of backdrop but also playing to sort of the work that weve been doing in that business and investing in clearly the market or the wallet is significantly up this quarter and we participated in that growth and we believe we captured more share to the degrees that the wallet shrinks we feel very good about the positions that weve established and we expect to continue to maintain that share but its really going to be the results being driven by what the wallet size looks like going forward morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i would add i mean id take it back and glenn youve been covering us for a long time so you know the history but lets go back to and when colm and ted restructured the ficc business and i think its the fourth quarter november december we cut the rwas we cut the people and the expenses by which was seen as pretty brutal at the time the rwas came down from i forget the original numbers but somewhere around billion to about billion over a couple of year period and we got out of the physical commodities business we had a much smaller footprint in the structured trading business the spg business was run a lot more tightly and i think the work the team put together to create an integrated investment bank leveraging the incredibly strong equities franchise with many of the same clients who are dealing with their fixed income franchise and at the same time building up dcm which created obviously further opportunity across all of fixed income so its a series of things now we always said that the business was longterm if it couldnt do billion in revenue in a quarter really wasnt a viable business so it was never going to meet its cost of capital and we sort of set that target out there was the minimum threshold against the backdrop of doing million million for two quarters in so that was pretty modest backdrop and obviously our competitors were doing multibillions at that point we then consistently delivered the last couple of years around billion a quarter we kind of nominally raised our minimum target to billion acknowledging you might have a bad quarter occasionally but weve de risked that enormously so the swings are much less volatile on the downside here we benefited from the massive financing wave very active markets i think a really good integrated investment bank led by ted pick ph sammy kelliesmith is running fixed income who had been previously the number two guy in the equities franchise for a long time putting all of that the management together the culture together the risk management together and away from the big structured illiquid positions and away from physical commodities and its all started to come together so were picking up share and when you have a market explosion that everybodys numbers are up i dont know then off our base you can start posting really respectable numbers and thats sort of where weve got to so its really a multiyear story now are we going to do billion in fixed income revenues this quarter no were not going to do billion in revenues at least from what i see in the outlook but that doesnt mean were going to have a bad quarter by any stretch so its that kind of backdrop that i feel i feel really good about our share position globally against the banks well never have some of the big macro businesses that the big universal banks have particularly in fx where we just have a much smaller footprint but nonetheless our macro business traded really well glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi well that brings in a followup is now that the fed has realized what you and many others thought about your excess capital position youve mentioned in the past about using some of it to augment the franchise and asset management but lets say the shackles come off sometime next year it doesnt matter when whats your thought process around deploying capital are there places to meaningfully deploy capital across the markets franchise or is the plan the same use it to augment asset management return the rest like how are you thinking about the excess capital now that the fed finally agrees morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i dont think this is either this or that were in a great position now weve got under the scb about basis points of excess capital well pick up jons saying its actually jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley basis points james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley basis points im sorry i shortchanged us by basis points who knew that could happen weve got the cet1 will be enhanced further by the etrade closure and obviously its not at that level but its still additive to our capital base if we come in with an scb shortfall wed be looking at doing things with the rwas in the business thered be more pressure on that we dont have that pressure so the share gains that we picked up we can maintain or even enhance and strategically well look across the trading franchise not to go gangbusters on that but are there opportunities where we can continue to pick up share possibly were certainly open to that in asset management as you know weve talked about this for a number of years because were our asset management franchise as i said our numbers have gone from beginning of i think they were at billion were over billion billion now attracting really good flows the platform is building up well wed love to augment that so thats a clear intent wealth management we did it with etrade so the opportunities to use capital are four one around further balance sheet expansion if we want to do that and our bias is to be conservative to be fair we dont but the good news is were not going to have to restructure or shrink our business because of some capital shortfall so number one that number two asset management transactions number three just investment in our platform and our technology to continue to modernize morgan stanley number four our dividend were paying out about a quarter which is about billion bit over billion annually we made in the first half of this year about billion so weve covered almost years of dividends in the first half of this year so our dividend coverage is very comfortable i would love to expand the dividend in time ive always said i think we should pay out effectively what we make in wealth management as dividend and think of that as a yield stock and think of the institutional business as a growth stock so thats coming and then obviously getting back on the buyback train weve still got weve got billionandachange of shares outstanding we started this at about billion wed like to continue to drive that number down we dont want to sit on this capital and not put it to work for shareholders we want to put it to work operator thank you our next question comes from christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp good morning james and jon maybe jon to clarify i think indiscernible asked but just to clarify on the wealth management nii the jumpoff point for is billion in and that will drift lower from billion right just because theres confusion around are you talking about ex prepay numbers et cetera i just wanted to clarify that its really the billion in this quarter and thats how to think about where the jumpoff point is morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah the first two quarters again were approximately billion christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp okay perfect okay thank you clear and then just more broadly i think you alluded to learning a lot about the expense structure of the business over the last few months so maybe just provide a bit more detail on kind of how youre thinking about what youve learnt and sort of like how you think that ultimately affects the longterm efficiency ratio potential of the firm jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i would say christian that we first of all the crisis is clearly not over were still in the middle of this and were continuing to learn about our infrastructure and our employees and whats the most efficient way to work so those comments were really around first we have to get through this and then longer term i think theres some interesting things that can come out of it clearly the workfromhome as a backup or as a backup or bcp planning measure is clearly an acceptable one weve been now at of the folks working from home for a while now and the plan continues to hold up quite well so i think there are some things that we can learn from that as well and so i think again longer term real estate decisions take a long time given leases and ownership but i think that well take a look at the footprint over time but our first priority right now is to get through the health crisis and keep our employees safe james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah let me just say a couple of things about expenses and about that real estate comment in particular because something ive said i think on the last call or on a tv interview was picked up and blown out of proportion firstly on the real estate footprint i said wed learnt to live with all of our people working from home or most of them and therefore that gave us an opportunity to rethink our real estate strategy that was interpreted by some in the media as were going to radically shift our footprint in our major locations thats not going to happen were committed to the major cities in this world where we have our headquarters here in new york where i am today with jon although socially distanced london frankfurt which weve moved and consolidated as our european headquarters tokyo and hong kong that doesnt change morgan stanley will remain a major player in the commercial real estate market globally however when we think about our dcp backup centers when we think about our consolidation in various offshore centers and our density management when we think about some of our excess capacity across our branch network is this the time to start addressing those issues clearly we have more flexibility to do it than we would have under normal circumstances and thats what were talking about are we going to be radically expanding real estate across the firm over the next five years i doubt that very much but are we going to be radically shrinking it i doubt that very much so hopefully that puts a more reasonable turn on what was picked up in those comments on the noncomp expenses though just to say we put on billion of extra revenue this quarter and we put on about billion of extra noncomp expenses this business has unbelievable operating leverage now to be fair it goes both ways right if you lose billion in revenue you cant bring down your noncomps that quickly so it goes both directions but if were in a growth mode and we can control these noncomps and obviously morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 comp except in wealth management is simply a ratio that we can manage you have embedded huge operating leverage in the business and thats why we saw the rotce numbers that we saw this quarter christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for taking the questions first it seems like forever ago but just how are you thinking about some of the strategic initiatives that you highlighted at the start of the year just given the current environment obviously a lot of puts and takes and outlook is still uncertain but just an update would be helpful james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well i would touch on and maybe jon wants to also add a little bit just on the i think we went public with three metrics pretax margin sort of mediumterm and then longterm aspiration efficiency ratio the same and rotce the same now not to be cute about it but in this quarter we achieved the longterm aspiration of efficiency ratio and the rotce im not pretending that thats a steady state right now ill be very happy if we go back to achieving what we said wed do in the twoyear period and were only six months into that twoyear period but as i said we have the noncomp operating leverage so the efficiency ratio to revenue growth i think is a slamdunk the rotce again with this kind of operating leverage and without the credit provisions if you have revenue growth im very comfortable with those the wealth management one thats more challenged because we did not expect to go to effectively zero interest rates at the beginning of the year that said even with this environment and with the pretty lousy print at the start of the quarter and with some of the integration costs that are coming from etrade built in they still hit margins of over and i think they will grind their way back up into the zone that we talked about how quickly thats going to happen mike im not going to predict but its not going to be forever so overall we stand by the strategy but we cant nobody in this world can predict goodness what the next month is going to be like let alone the rest of this year and weve got a presidential election coming all sorts of massive uncertainty some of that uncertainty as we just demonstrated plays to our favor so i dont jon im sure will have a view on when these mediumterm goals when its realistic to come and talk seriously about them again but its too early yet but it is interesting that through the first half of this year were basically on track for two of the three of them jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah and the only other observation i would make is when we laid out those goals we hadnt announced the etrade transaction yet either so were going to i think the course of the rest of the year and getting the deal closed and seeing where we end up and then when we come back in january im sure well update you on what were seeing and how we feel about those goals morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay makes sense and just a quick followup on etrade just given a lot of the industry changes in wealth and online banking you guys mentioned in providing you with online brokerage and like the corporate platform just how are you thinking about like the online banking kind of aspect and in addition to that the ria custody platforms as well james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley the online banking is clearly additive building our digital banking across our millions of households in our wealth management using the etrade platform for that clearly additive the other question was i think the ria platform early days but ive always thats a decent business model it just isnt one that weve had now weve got an opportunity with it through etrade and i like why not right thats an opportunity for us to pursue but its very early days its a tiny business for them our major obviously the elephant is our core advisory business and thats not going to be disrupted but well take a look at the ria stuff as we get into it next year jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah and i would just add that the etrade has performed exceptionally well during this period sort of validated many of the reasons why were so excited about doing the transaction customer activity levels are at record highs exceptional net new asset and account growth at this point through their public disclosures through may theyve sort of outperformed on new assets and clients sort of all of last year the plant has held up very well the technology is excellent theyve had no hard outages and all of the reasons why we bought the company i think have been enhanced and validated through this period michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc great thanks operator thank you our next question comes from andrew lim with socgén your line is now open andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi thanks for taking my questions great results i just wondered if you could talk a bit more about your etrade ambitions i know obviously the numbers and your targets are going to be disclosed later but strategically can you just talk more specifically about what you hope to achieve with the integration in terms of like maybe like ambitions on the revenue synergy front or was it mainly just like a scale gain obviously the big ui in asset and wealth management the plus efficiencies you get and then secondly a few of your competitors have talked about the shape of trading for the second half i was wondering what your expectations were for the second half versus the first half but also versus the second half of thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well i will touch briefly on the strategic rationale for etrade we did that earlier this year but ill repeat that and jon im sure will have a crystal ball on what the second half is going to look like versus the second half of last year id be interested to hear his crystal ball because were all kind of curious how its going to unfold but i morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 will say im very comfortable with morgan stanley as an institution through the second half of this year we have many many businesses and much of our revenues that are not driven by the volatile trading activity so anyway ill let jon handle that one just quickly on etrade andrew as you know and i think as we said very clearly at the time it makes us i think the largest player in the workplace sector in this country which is the third channel for client acquisition behind some sort of advisory personal interaction and digital it makes us the second or third largest player in the digital space and were the first or largest player in the core advisory space so were in all three channels it diversifies our revenues as an institution by adding billion of revenue it improves our cet1 ratio it gives us a platform to take digitally internationally it creates an opportunity for us to build the digital bank across our wealth management business they have a small ria platform which i mentioned which is interesting we have obviously some expense consolidation across the two platforms they have a terrific brand for a younger generation of investors they have a terrific brand for more active trader investors and options trading investors which were excited about so there are a long line of things that make this attractive and the test was how did they hold up in this period of incredible volatility and as jon just said they held up extraordinarily well theyve attracted hundreds of thousands of new accounts but with that has come real money not just kids playing this is real stuff they brought in billions of dollars of net new assets and deposits and their platform has remained very stable so that is the etrade story its a continuing evolution of the morgan stanley strategy and a nod to the fact that having stronger digital capability across our wealth management business is critical and a nod to the fact that were interested in expanding internationally jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley i will not attempt to make a crystal ball prediction but given some of the comments that i made in my opening remarks clearly we have a differentiated model with wealth and im which is sort of the stability of that model and those businesses should continue to perform quite well and then the which we referred to historically as the ballast and then the isg creates some of the alpha as james said it would be hard to see how we reproduce the first half results in the second half results but we also think well continue to do quite well given the market share gains that weve made and the client penetration that we have and its really just going to be a function of what the wallet size is in the second half and i dont think anyone has the ability to predict what that will be operator thank you our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc all right great good morning i guess first question here with respect to dfast and thanks for the color and obviously the overall positive outcome but james you mentioned working with the regulators stressed scenarios arent i dont think necessarily reflecting how the business actually behaves and weve seen that in trading over the past couple of quarters in whats i think a realworld stress test so im just curious if these are normal conversations just around future dfast assumptions and modeling that you kind of always have or is it related to the outcome it sounds like some peers like goldman are potentially petitioning for some relief so im just kind of curious around that comment morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i think devin i dont want to get ahead of the regulators and we havent obviously discussed anything relating to capital and capital requirements in the light of these earnings but its a more fundamental view if you go back to regulators would be entirely justified in being highly skeptical of morgan stanleys business model at that point given our trajectory coming out of the financial crisis and the early days when the integration of smith barney looked to be slower than what most people had hoped it never bothered me by the way but most people were anxious about it so there was kind of a period of lets just wait and see and i think some of the market models that they put in place that affect all of the banks disproportionately hurt morgan stanley as the time has progressed and the business model has played out and the stability of the franchise now fully tested here and with producing roe over and most of the competitive set are basis points to basis points below that it certainly gives pause to reflect on the stability of the business model now lets play it out a couple more quarters ive said for a long time that ppnr results do not reflect certainly what we think about the business and for that we believe that there is a model issue relating to financial advisor compensation how fixed that is believed to be when in fact its not fixed at all its a commissionbased structure so theres potential for the regulatory relief on that which weve been arguing for for many years and i think its wellunderstood now by the regulators but listen morgan stanley is not the morgan stanley it was years ago were a different institution we didnt have the credit provisions that everybody else had thats not luck thats by design we dont have exposure to unsecured consumer credit we have very little emerging market credit we have very little small business and middlemarket lending its by design so at some point if your model is built not to endure the credit kind of hits that the other banks naturally have given their portfolio and you dont have the illiquidity that you had in your trading businesses and you have the ballast of the wealth management and the repetitiveness of those revenues and earnings then youre a different kind of animal and thats really what weve been arguing for for a long time im not going to get ahead of the regulatory discussions weve got another ccar test jon coming i think in the next couple of months so clearly that test will reflect a covid type world more explicitly than the last one and well play it out but morgan stanley currently has excess capital and i believe we just accreted another billion i believe were going to accrete excess capital through the rest of this year and be sitting with many billions of dollars of excess capital at yearend and we want to do something with that jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley let me just add a couple of quick observations one there is a formal appeals process we are not entertaining that these are just natural and normal dialogues we have with our regulators and as james said weve been talking about it with them for years i do think that we saw some recognition of that in this years results some of the ppnr modeling is more reflective of more recent results and obviously given the transformation that weve gone through we started to see some of that in the results but again we think theres more there and then on the last point of a resubmission as james said the fed did release sensitivity analysis it was very geared towards lending and credit losses as he mentioned we do have a differentiated portfolio not only in terms of its makeup but also in terms of its size weve avoided unsecured consumer very limited small business middlemarket small commercial banking so its just a much different model and i think it will fare quite well in the resubmission and obviously weve all seen what the trading results have been through this morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 many stress tests so we feel good about the capital position we feel good about where we stand in ccar and we continue to talk to our regulators about sort of the results and the transformation that this company has gone through operator thank you our next question comes from robert rutschow with wells fargo your line is now open robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question the first question is on deposits how did the delay in the tax deadline impact deposits in the second quarter have you seen a runoff in the last couple of weeks as we approached the deadline and is there still an opportunity to reinvest some of those deposits at higher rates to pick up some yield jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure so it clearly has had an impact the payment date was yesterday typically we see the runoff sort of post the payment date historically its sort of been in and around billion to billion so we would expect something comparable and similar there but i think the interesting dynamic around the deposits are as you said we have the excess position weve seen sort of a rotation into the markets really slowing so if you look at this period we saw about billion of cash come into the system from a combination of dividends and interest but also new cash into the system and only billion of that went into the market so net up billion in bdp as i just said we would expect to see some of that flow out with tax payments but what weve definitely seen is last year this period that number would not have been positive at all it was about a negative billion so the deposit levels have really stabilized and started to creep up and i think what the opportunity for us is as the durability of these deposits increase and weve seen them to be pretty stable now well probably just continue to pay down some of our higher cost wholesale liabilities weve got about billion of cds that will runoff over the next months we clearly dont need to replace those and some other thirdparty arrangements as well so its really going to be around reducing some of the wholesale liabilities and then continue to deploy that into the lending growth that were seeing in that business operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect morgan stanley ms corrected transcript
