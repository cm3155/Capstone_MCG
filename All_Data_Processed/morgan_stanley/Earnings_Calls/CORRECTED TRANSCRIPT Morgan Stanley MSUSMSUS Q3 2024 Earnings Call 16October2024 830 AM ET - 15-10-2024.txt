litigation and consulting spend contributed to this years operating leverage while maintaining strong infrastructure to support ongoing growth now to the businesses institutional securities revenues were billion notwithstanding advisory and equity underwriting markets remaining below historical averages the segments revenues represented a near record third quarter performance accelerated towards the end of the quarter and was driven by the benefits of scale and the global reach of our integrated investment bank activity outside the us drove the segments outperformance relative to historical averages our global footprint positioned us well to capture share as risk events around the world drove activity including the bank of japans monetary policy changes shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the feds first rate cut and chinas announced stimulus we supported our clients morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 investment banking revenues increased to billion the yearoveryear improvement was driven by continued strength in underwriting led by debt underwriting and further aided by a pickup in advisory revenues steady improvements in corporate and sponsor activity as well as our investments in talent and client relationships are yielding results advisory revenues of million increased yearoveryear on modestly higher completed ma transactions in the quarter with particular strength in emea large fee events from closed deals in emea including those involving financial sponsors supported the strongest quarter in over a decade for the region equity underwriting revenues were million while global market volumes remain well below historical trend lines revenues were higher yearoveryear with a notable pickup of activity in asia driven by ipos and followons fixed income underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior year to million results were driven by strong noninvestment grade issuance supported by both refinancing and eventdriven activity as well as a record third quarter volumes in the investment grade market pipelines are healthy and diverse we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear capital markets recovery corporate activity is gaining momentum and the desire among sponsors to transact is steadily materializing not only domestically but also abroad while we are

robust at billion the business navigated bouts of market volatility well and remained nimble as we supported clients in particular performance in the americas and asia was strong prime brokerage revenues were above historical averages as client balances once again reached a new peak driven by higher equity markets cash results improved versus the prior year reflecting higher volumes across the regions derivative results were also up yearoveryear reflecting an increase in client activity coupled with an improved trading environment in asia associated with chinas announced stimulus in the final weeks of september fixed income revenues were billion driven by strength in macro particularly rates largely offset by results in commodities that were stronger in the prior year results reflect solid performance in emea and asia as well as a coordinated global effort to support clients through periods of volatility macro revenues increased versus the prior year attributed to higher client engagement as our rates business navigated the markets well amidst shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the feds first rate cut micro results were roughly flat yearoveryear results in commodities declined compared to the strong prior year which benefited from elevated volatility in energy markets turning to isg lending and provision in the quarter isg provisions were million

business produced a record revenue of billion and record pbt highlighting the models strong operating leverage strength in wealth management reflects a morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 combination of constructive markets and a disciplined execution of our strategy client assets in wealth management reached trillion feebased flows were strong demonstrating the power of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel and the value of advice our multichannel model is driving durable long term growth and profitability benefiting from continued investments in our expanded offering and technology moving on to our business metrics pretax profits of billion drove the margin to in the quarter dcp negatively impacted the margin by approximately basis points asset management revenues were billion up yearoveryear driven by the cumulative impact of positive feebased flows and higher markets fee based flows in the quarter were robust at billion and yeartodate flows are on pace to exceed last year supported by an ongoing contribution of assets from advisorled brokerage accounts to feebased accounts clients are diversifying feebased accounts to include fixed income and alternative products feebased assets now stands at trillion net new assets were billion bringing yeartodate net new assets to billion which represents annualized growth of beginning period assets net new assets in the quarter were supported by our advisorled and workplace channels with a notable contribution from new clients in the advisorled channel transactional revenues were billion and excluding the impact of dcp were up yearoveryear overall higher levels of client activity supported results loan growth was billion for the second consecutive quarter driven by mortgages total deposits increased sequentially to billion while average sweeps were down slightly recent stabilization particularly weve seen recent signs of stabilization particularly as the fed began cutting rates this is encouraging net interest income was billion looking ahead to the fourth quarter we would expect nii to be modestly down from the third quarter results largely on the back of lower rate expectations consistent with the forward curve we are committed to continuing to execute as the opportunity in front of us remains significant we currently touch million relationships million more than last year our expanded offering includes unique market access for highnetworth clients across a broad range of alternative products and more recently robust private market services which continues to attract demand we are investing in our intellectual capital unique products and an integrated infrastructure to help our advisors serve their clients turning to investment management revenues of billion increased compared to the prior year results reflect higher asset management and related fees which increased yearoveryear driven by higher average aum longterm net flows were approximately billion inflows were primarily driven by continued demand in alternatives and solutions and were further supported by our fixed income strategies since the acquisition of eaton vance within alternatives and solutions parametric customized portfolios have been a consistent source of strength our multiyear investments into investment managements partnership with wealth management includes initiatives around advisor education on our taxefficient product capabilities this has helped drive steady demand originating from our own wealth management clients as well as the broader retail base liquidity and overlay services had inflows of billion led by our parametric overlay strategies performance based income and other revenues were million results supported gains in infrastructure and real estate and since total aum now stands at trillion our investments in customization and alternatives are showing returns demonstrated by positive longterm flows this quarter we continue to invest in secular growth products in order to meet global client demand morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 turning to the balance sheet total spot assets grew to trillion standardized rwas increased sequentially to billion as we actively supported clients we accreted approximately billion of common tier capital our standardized cet1 ratio stands at we continue to deliver on our commitment to the dividend which we raised to per quarter in this quarter and we bought back million of common stock during the quarter our yeartodate results serve as hard evidence that we are executing on the opportunity set benefiting from being global and diversified with the resources to invest in growth across wealth and investment management we reached trillion of total client assets expanding markets and increased client engagement should further support asset growth as we progress toward trillion in client assets with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well take our first question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley hey good morning steve edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so hey ted hey sharon how are you both doing so wanted to start off with just a question on op leverage you noted that the management team has been very focused on driving more efficiency were definitely seeing now on the isg side incremental margins even in wealth youre delivering incremental margins just wanted to gauge your sustainability of some of those higher marginal margins just given some of the efforts you cited on the efficiency side while continuing to invest for growth sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly thank you for the question and thank you for noting the progress we have been really focused on this over the course of the year and i would say that its not the intention has not been to be shortsighted but rather to take a very longterm lens as we think about efficiency over the course of this spring we began to look not only at oneyear budgets but really two to threeyear outlooks not just about revenues but also understanding morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 where are the efficiencies that we have to gain and where can we consolidate certain investments in order to make room for what would be investments in growth i highlighted occupancy because thats one thats very notable in the sec disclosures youll see that over the course of the yeartodate basis that line item has really only increased about million and weve made a lot of room to invest in optimization of the space but also investments of space you think about data centers you think about new buildings you think about new technology and new places that you think need to be used for occupancy so there is a way that were thinking about selffunding same goes for a decline in professional services some of that was related to remember we were going through many years of integration and while we stopped disclosing on an integration basis there were still places that we thought that we could augment what we were looking at from a professional service basis and where we were thinking about longterm gains on the other side of that youve seen increases in places like bce because we have been in a position where weve been supporting our clients were also making space investing in the infrastructure as we think about the growth that we have going forward some of that just has to do with cyber resilience a thing that you would expect us to do as we grow the business going forward but were also looking at places where were investing for fas new products new technology that can give them space to go and prosecute new clients which you see in our net new assets in the course of the quarter and broadly as you think about risk and controls you need to make sure that you have all of the right like ive said infrastructure really the foundation and the building blocks so that when you have growth youre able to support it on a goforward basis so weve been looking at it from both sides steve and it is a multiyear process and we would continue to do that not just in this business cycle and this budget cycle but as we go forward over multiple years steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for all that perspective sharon and maybe just for a quick followup on the wealth business the kpis were quite strong across board clearly reflects a very strong momentum in the third quarter especially in september just wanted to better understand if there were any idiosyncratic factors that maybe drove some of that strength inevitably when you see that type of momentum it begs the question as to how durable or sustainable some of those kpis might be and especially focused on just the growth in sweep deposits which was certainly a nice surprise sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah specifically id say actually all the kpis and all the underlying is strong sweeps being one that i called out as the deposit trends are certainly encouraging especially since the fed began to cut rates weve seen that over the backend of september and even as we look into the beginning of the fourth quarter on a relative basis in terms of expectations so that has been positive the underlying for me on all of the asset growth both on nna as well as feebased assets theres not one particular driver but rather youve seen the advicebased side really picking up youve seen clients and fas engage there continues to be investments into markets on a monthly level from brokerage from brokered sweeps which you didnt see last year so needless to say the markets are improving youre seeing momentum in the economy uncertainties are lifting and retail clients are engaged both from seeking advice but also coming to the platform as new clients which i think is a particularly good trend to watch morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning ted i guess maybe just first question on capital priorities just talk to us in terms of how youre thinking about the capital ratio today in context of you are still waiting for the basel iii proposal but more importantly i think the history of the last years has been excellent capital allocation organic or inorganic as youre looking at the world today ted where are you deploying capital where are the best investment opportunities is it in market is it in wealth is it in international would love to get your perspective edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley thanks for the question as you know were at cet1 the new number is so our buffer is basis points we like that buffer gives us room to operate you saw that we had some riskweighted asset increase but we still manage to keep the ratios at 15plus so theres a story here which is to continue to price bestinclass financial strength along the lines of capital and liquidity but also to lean in to the businesses as the market opportunity affords we did that clearly in both businesses you saw it in the investment bank where we gained share across the primary and both markets businesses but you also saw it in wealth management some of the technology spend that sharon described in the sort of forced hierarchy of what we would wish to do at any given moment around capital allocation as we said before its the dividend first that is sacrosanct and we continue to grow it second here because of the secular growth and where we are in the cycle as sharon just described there is a good cause to be investing in all three segments wealth management investment management and the investment bank and to do so across the world were clearly seeing rates of equitization increasing in places like japan and india and on the continent so having a global franchise and investing in that we think is existentially important and then the buyback is opportunistic well be buying back billionplus this year as its an ongoing lever that were going to pull of course the basel uncertainty will likely last through the election and we have our ph points of add we can see that are aligned with the industry but also those things that matter very much to morgan stanley specifically and were going to continue to make our case conservatively respectfully and well see how it plays out after the election but as it stands now basis points of buffer on cet1 slr we are investing in the business were achieving operating leverage so these things are always a movable feast but we are keeping a very close eye on it and were happy with how were optimizing the allocation ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and one quick followup for you sharon on sweep deposits nii all that good stuff just as we think about rate cuts clients kind of maybe ph serving as a trigger event for clients to reallocate how they invest is the nii giveortake close to a bottom because of a certain level of sort of i think youve talked in the past about cash balances that clients have maintained are we close to that and if we get qt maybe before the end morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 of the year could those deposit balances potentially have one less headwind and as a result grow looking into next year despite rate cuts sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so let me take the last part of your question first just to be clear qt hasnt really been a driver for us i would say thats more for a commercial bank so in either direction it was i dont think it has to do with a decline or an increase so id put that aside because our deposit base is just slightly different when we look at where weve been and the types of language that weve used historically i would say that just to put it in context the rate environment has changed its changed since the second quarter and i would say its changed pretty materially so we dont have control as we all know in terms of where interest rates are going what i can speak to is where we are from a deposit level and as ive said the trends that we have seen are extremely encouraging if you think about where weve come from and where we are over the course of the last couple of weeks especially when the fed ever since the fed has cut interest rates the nearterm guidance that i gave is that we will likely be modestly down over the course on a quarterover quarter basis and where we will be as we look into i think we will reevaluate based on where sweeps are one but more importantly on the forward is likely where interest rates are which will be a function of what does the fed do in november what does it do in december and what is the path for when we sit at the beginning of january but i just want to put a little bit of perspective around the conversations that weve had about sweeps and nii over the course of the last couple of years i understand that its been a very important topic for investors especially when you think about sweeps in particular but sweeps as i said have been to some degree stabilizing and when you look at nii for morgan stanley on a relative basis think about where we were last year in the third quarter the delta between nii this quarter and last quarter is million we make million a day in this business every single day and so i think that we really need to begin to think about what is the model what are we thinking about and how are we executing in the model asset management feebased revenues that increased this year is double the decline of nii so we just need to gain a bit of perspective now that we see where sweeps are that the markets are coming back and that we continue to see asset management fees rise and that is the durable revenue and what expect to see from this business model as we move forward operator our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi hello there okay so with rwa up i had assumed that it was trading and clientled with pb balances at record highs and it comes with a bar thats actually down a little bit so im curious do you think that ebbsand flows with just the environment or is there some of the your capital plan continue to feed this great client franchise across markets morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 and ill just ask the followup with it because i think it goes together better with all of that wealth and wealth hasnt now that youve made a lot of investments wealth doesnt need a lot more capital infusion if you will based on how youre going about your capital plan do you envision any material shifts in literally business mix weve gotten all very accustomed and used to a big percentage of this company being asset and wealth management thanks for both of those sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure let me take them backwards glenn just so ill talk to wealth wealth sees a steady a very small but steady increase when you look back in history associated with rwas and a lot of that just has to do with the lending growth and as we think about greater household penetration greater usage of those products by fas and offering that to our client base that will probably thats kind of where youll see that capital allocation as we move forward when you think about isg though and the rwas has been implemented in the business there if you look at the loans and lending commitments youll see that where weve actually seen a lot of the growth is really on corporates and a lot of that underlying is corporates and all of the assets are also the fid secured lending that is inherent to the integrated investment bank and the integrated firm we have said over the course of the last two years that we expect this to be a investment bankingled recovery weve also said and weve invested in individuals and when you think about talent in terms of the investment bank more broadly thats where youre seeing the rwas being put to work and thats actually also where youre seeing the results right thats where youre seeing an increase in dcm an increase in different parts of the balance of fixed income coming from more lending durable financing revenue so its very much alongside what were thinking about the stabilization and the durability of the investment bank rather than something thats necessarily more episodic of course it will ebbandflow as you see deals and transactions and that environment for those corporates but thats how i would think about it broadly edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley yeah what id add to that is what is important too as you look through the metrics glenn is that the revenues in the investment bank are up yearoveryear and roughly flat down sequentially but in that same period the trading bar the value of risk across the investment bank is running flattish and that is in fact its slightly down so we were able to put up some real operating leverage without taking up the underlying measured risk in the business which speaks to sort of the type of durable revenue model that sharon described across our integrated investment bank operator our next question comes from devin ryan with citizens jmp edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley hi devin devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hey good morning ted and sharon hey first question on nii in wealth obviously a lot goes into that but it would be great if you could maybe speak to some of the secondorder impacts of lower interest rates we should be thinking about and maybe some that are a little bit less obvious like changes in margin utilization or securities lending or securitiesbased loans or even customer engagement with certain types of products or really anything else im missing there just would love to kind of get some more flavor around the implications and how you guys are thinking about the secondorder impacts on nii as you look out over the next year or so sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah we continue as i mentioned this is the second quarter that weve seen loan growth i wouldnt weve seen stronger quarters so this is just the beginning basically theres been a steady increase in mortgages even though theres the rate hike cycle where it is and the rates were higher and over time as rates would come down youd expect to begin to see refinancing activity which will spur lending youll also likely see as you get into tax cycles with asset levels where they are an increase also in sbl so those lending products have been relatively muted versus the historical basis and it wouldnt be surprising to begin to see more and more of that activity on the forward devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc okay great thanks sharon and then just want to come back to the really nice quarter you put up in net new assets in wealth and you touched on a notable contribution from new clients in advisorled and so im just curious if theres anything else you can highlight that supported that momentum with new clients specifically whether its in new products or if there was programs internally that youre running to support that because it sounds like it was a catalyst im just curious if that could continue sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so specifically on new clients devin id remind you a conversation that jed had when he spoke publicly recently which was really about what were doing on stock plan and different ways that were introducing fas to new clients we call them human referrals its a place where you begin to think about if someones calling for example into a call center or they have come to a different event and they would like to actually be matched with a financial advisor remember were using technology different parts of ai and different ways to begin to appropriately match individuals with fas we think will suit them those human referrals are double and over yeartodate versus what youve seen in the past so i think that thats a place where weve invested in technology we understand now how to better match and understand individuals and their needs and were giving them an opportunity to see the value of the device on the forward and thats what youre seeing in those numbers in terms of the net new assets so its really bearing fruit in terms of the investments weve made operator our next question comes from dan fannon with jefferies edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning dan daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hey good morning i was hoping you could expand upon some of the strength of activity outside the us some of the events you cited seems countryspecific but can you talk to how you see the rest of the world participating and what you guys have said will be an investment banking recovery and certainly we know the us is focused in terms of the potential cap markets recovery but curious as how you think about the broader base outside the us edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley the integrated investment bank premise that we built over the last years it really intensified over the last five years was that it takes a real local commitment to have a global investment bank weve made real investments on the continent for example in iberia in italy in france we continue to be the largest presence actually as ph tenancy matter in canary wharf so in the uk so our european commitment is real across both investment banking and increasingly in the markets business thats in the investment bank but also we have a thriving investment management business the lps who are well ph sconced on the continent and were building that integrated capability with alternative solutions and the like we have been strong as you know in asia for really decades and that spoke to the power of a global investment banking institution that when we had disruptive events as sharon alluded to in tokyo and then in china in the last couple of months leading into this quarter it was important that we have a leading investment banking and markets presence both in japan and in hong kong and mainland so here the seamless execution will pay off as crossborder ma intensifies as parts of the world outside of the us where of course we have our concentrated bet as regional matter to the point you were asking you see good growth in revenues in both in asia and in europe you saw yearoveryear growth of almost for the firm in emea europe middle east africa and then 30plus in asia that speaks to having a local presence such that when the investment banking cycle really kicks in and companies wish to engage in strategic activity which includes obviously getting bigger or making a sale and potentially go public locally that we are going to have the kind of presence to transact so running the global investment bank is going to pay for years to come and i would add by the way that an important part culturally of what weve done at morgan stanley for many years which is bearing fruit is to mobilize some of our senior talent from one region to another not just across businesses but across regions which is important when you have of your people outside the united states that theyre familiar with our operations in places like india and budapest daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thats helpful and then just as a followup within investment management ph longer in certain inflows thats certainly a positive but if we look at the backdrop markets are up significantly yearto date revenues have moved modestly but still have expenses so as you think about the asset mix thats coming in the door thats skewed more towards lower fee whether thats within parametric or fixed income how do you expect or how do you plan on improving the overall profitability of that segment as you think about the longerterm trends that are putting more pressure on fees sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley ill take that so youre right to identify that there is a mix shift as were seeing different types of flows id also note though there are also investments being made when you think about just the expenses to help make sure morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 that were there to service the clients in terms of where were seeing the secular growth trends so its an asset story on parametric its an asset story on alternatives were investing in both both of those are places we see secular growth trends and were making sure to be there for our clients now alternatives is going to be higher fees just basic private credit et cetera will be higher fees than you might see in parametric that being said i dont see it simply as a fee sort of game but rather the greater the assets the more opportunity and the more to be the leader in the space and to continue to attract new capital to seek new opportunities so overall i see it more as a strategy associated with asset building aggregation and being there to service our clients but also making sure that we have the capital there to invest so things like parametric youre going to need to spend money on more market data youre going to need to build relationships with wealth and thats going to cost money on the margin in the shortterm but it will give us the opportunity for growth as we move forward over the longterm operator our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey ted good morning all right so im willing to risk the wrath of sharon here and ask a question on nii and i well i totally appreciate its just a part of the wealth business right so totally get that but i thought it was really encouraging to see the endofperiod deposit costs tick down pretty decently quarteroverquarter so maybe is that driven by the fact that youve seen a lot of those deposits shift into like the higher cost and therefore higher beta products and so would that be sustainable and then when were thinking about a combination of that de facto higher beta the potential for reinvestment tailwinds in the securities book and loan growth is it too optimistic to think that nii could grow next year sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so thank you brennan i appreciate that you do understand the business and you do understand that there are multiple drivers of this business i think what youre hitting on is that there are a lot of places that you can still see growth that is not specific only to the deposit mix so yes its encouraging to see certain pieces now of course you also had our fed rate cut in there so that will continue to bring the cost of certain types of deposits you think about the beta the beta will really depend like you alluded to also on products so things like a savings product will have a much will have a much higher beta than something like a sweeps product which will have a much lower beta theyre two different products with two different purposes in terms of the dynamics of what they are used for now on the forward it will of course depend on the fed rate path there are so many changes that have taken place over the course of the last quarter that make it very difficult to say well where will the fed be and where will be those investment opportunities so where i would sort of point to is there are three pieces that weve always talked about that will drive nii two of them are encouraging thats the growth on the asset side in terms of where youre seeing us being able to actually deploy the capital where youre seeing people ask for lending opportunities et cetera its growing its encouraging morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 sweeps what we know and what weve seen especially since the first rate cut is also very encouraging particularly as historically if you look back and i said this in the last quarter call generally speaking when you begin to see interest rate cuts you do begin to see different parts of deposits rise so again an encouraging sign where will it be when you think about reinvestment and the rest of nii that in and of itself is really the fed and if we go back a quarter ago no one it was a very low probability to see a 50basis point rate cut and lo and behold we had one so why dont we see where we are after the november and december meetings and then restate kind of where we think well be over the course of the year just from a rate perspective but those three building blocks you know what they are and you know that the two that are under our control or they have to do sort of i wouldnt say under our control but rather have to do with what our clients are doing ive told you what im seeing from our data and its all positive brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay totally thats helpful thanks sharon and then for the followup maybe shifting gears a little bit you spoke to sponsor engagement weve seen some sponsors actually start to hit the ipo market given your strength in ecm and the strong franchise you have there what are you seeing on the ipo pipeline front and how should we be thinking about that outlook into next year edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley well as you know the sponsors have roughly trillion of dry powder they have trillion to trillion of portfolio companies in the ground by some measures companies in the ground and for the first time in close to years there the deployment is outpacing the fundraising so there is a need for that group to move and they act as a liquidity source but they also act as a competitive player to our traditional corporate community i think much has been said about the barrierstoentry to be a highly regulated sarbox public company but i would take the view that there are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets that currency allows them to make acquisitions to set up longterm compensation plans and like to go global so what id expect to see are larger companies going public having been private for some time reaching a level that makes them a tougher sale on the private front there are private alternatives but the going public phenomenon is not going away and i made reference to this earlier i think there is a goingpublic phenomenon that will exist around the world whether its select countries doing privatizations whether its exciting companies that for the first time are reaching global benchmarks so i think were going to see the ipo market slowly work its way back larger names coming to market and then when they do quite quickly needing the fullservice suite of a global investment bank needing the treasury capabilities needing hedging services needing the kind of advice at a mid or largecap a mature company needs and that of course on a global scale is right in our sweet spot so im bullish on ipos and ma coming back it may take some time and the size of the companies when they come will be likely larger so therell be slower unit volume than the sort of the heyday of postcovid stimulus and quick listings but i think these are going to be global mature companies which are going to very much need our advice operator our next question comes from christian bolu with autonomous morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning christian christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning ted and sharon on wealth management really nice to see solid loan growth in the last two quarters just thinking a little bit looking forward here as rates come down kind of how are you thinking about maybe longerterm growth do you think loan growth can maybe reaccelerate back to precovid levels where we were seeing 20plus percent growth per year or is that business more mature today with less growth upside sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley no i actually thank you for the question i dont think that its more mature with less upside i actually think theres more upside to go when you think about the penetration of fas using those products so we used to be sort of in the lowdouble digits in terms of that penetration thats moved up to somewhere in the teens but we do think that theres opportunity to surpass that higher and if you look sort of at peers even in similar kinds of channels so not lending through a commercial bank but more on the wealth side those numbers are higher so there are certainly opportunities there christian so thats why i appreciate you asking the question i wouldnt say its not just on the mortgage side that certainly can come back but sbls have been relatively flat and its not surprising weve talked a lot about the uses of those lines and especially if rates are low thinking about how to use those lines to pay taxes for example and think about what youre doing from an efficiency perspective with your portfolio as an individual investor christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp okay very helpful thanks maybe one more on deposits wealth management and deposit again appreciate this is maybe a smaller issue now and fading away but how are you thinking about just the philosophy around deposit pricing within wealth management given some of the sec scrutiny and then maybe any data you can provide around how much of this new cash is in the advisoryrelated assets sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so why dont we just ill take it to sort of i guess together but answer it slightly backwards which is we talked about different pricing changes and last quarter we also said that that was a small portion in terms of where the changes were going to be made so its small its in the run rate you saw it over the course of the quarter and it was in the results when we think about deposit pricing we take a number of factors into consideration and one of the most important factors that we highlighted last quarter and weve been looking at even through this cutting cycle are competitive dynamics and where competitive pricing is so thats its the market and its also competition its the need for deposits and its where that is on a relative value perspective so all of those things that include the customer as well operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi ted hi sharon sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc in your prepared remarks you guys talked about your prime brokerage revenues were above historical averages as clients balances reach new peaks can you share with us how much of that is driven by just existing clients or also youre expanding your client base where youre growing that as well can you compare the two areas of driving these numbers edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley well i think the question is an interesting one because the barrierstoentry to scaling a new asset manager are quite high but we host as youre aware our capintro conference every january down in breakers have done that for decades and continue to draw enormous demand to try to get a slot because once youve made it the platform economics of success and your ability to penetrate various distribution channels enables you to get big quite quickly so its sort of tough to make it but once youve made it you can really scale into a large institution by and large though the growth that weve seen across equities to hit the billion mark over the last couple of quarters that youve seen has not been consuming additional vars its just staying close to our clients these results indicate that weve increased wallet with predominantly the existing base so weve done that around the world and the leverage levels for a lot of these clients in the quant and platform space are actually running close to the typical range for that subgroup so weve been able to interact with them in a productive way across not just prime brokerage but cash and derivatives too and then importantly across the markets business so this is part of this integrated investment bank philosophy that you can have folks that are traditional players in one pocket moving across the asset spectrum and the leadership in the markets business has done a great job facilitating that not just across underliers but as i mentioned in the past quarter across regions and to the extent that there are spinouts or others we have a vibrant business now in the middle east too in abu dhabi and in scandinavia in copenhagen those are the two offices we recently opened and i mentioned them because they are not just great possibles for investment banking and for our investment management business but theyre also very interesting for our markets business too gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 very helpful thank you and then just as a quick followup i always appreciate your guys insights and others that really dont have big exposures to credit and so you mentioned that you had chargeoffs of million in commercial real estate and corporate loans can you give us any color again youre not a big lender like a jpmorgan or a bank of america so insights from folks like you i think are very helpful any color here sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure those are largely provisioned for and so i think what youve seen is that its almost as though some of the credit changes have been working themselves through the market if you look back over the course of the last two years weve had a lot of conversations gerard specifically talking about cre youve had some great questions as it relates to that space we saw that that was happening we provisioned for it and over time you will see that likely come through on the other side as chargeoffs and thats kind of where we are at this point in the cycle operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning earlier you talked about your tech efforts and so ted as you think about ai is morgan stanley a leader or a close follower you wait for others to do it and then more specifically whats going on with your partnership with openai i see a quote here from morgan stanley openai is perhaps the best example to date of empowering morgan stanley with the marriage of human advice and technology and i think youre unique in using openai so any color you can provide would be great sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure ill take it because we continue to do work with openai in terms of where we are overall on the technology side mike you saw a lot of our products very early say almost years ago at this point in time when we did our first tech expo and we looked at tools that we were using ai and different types of machine learning et cetera to give our advisors tools to give them more time to prospect business as it relates specifically to that partnership that partnership is going extremely well we continue to look at new platforms and new applications that we can use with them and there are new places that were using ai that weve launched and weve discussed over the course of the last two quarters or so one is we obviously do have a tool where fas can use and speak to our research portal so to speak and understand that ai will basically read everything and then can help you answer different questions associated with whats already been published in terms of that volume of data in addition to that as we moved forward we can have tools like debrief where an individual of course gaining permission in a meeting can use what theyve heard in a meeting through ai translate languages et cetera summarize and then be able to send out emails as followups based on the conversations had in those meetings with a draft obviously you have human interaction after in a human overlay but just gives you the bare bones again to save time for the advisors as we move forward morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 were doing that across the institution in different pockets and spaces as part of the if we think back to the efficiency work that we started this call with there will be places where we can use ai to also think through efficiencies so its a balance of understanding where to invest and then how to use that to gain time back from a productivity standpoint as we move forward edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley and i also like the question because it suggests that there are going to be opportunities where being a fast follower is just fine where you can take existing capability and make the digitization process easier on a straight cost effectiveness play where to sharons comments where we are really digging in as a call it proprietary matter is around the productive efficiency inside of wealth management this entire we call it aims as you know ai morgan stanley the ai morgan stanley assistant is just the first chapter of what were going to do across the financial advisor platform specific to our own offering with clients where we think were going to have some real edge mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you say its the first chapter of what just i know this is looking forward but what could be some other chapters as it relates to ai edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley at our place well its going to be a tool at the very least that is going to help inform fas on what is relevant at any given moment under any different any given paradigm they are going to have access to information across a whole bunch of data sets ongoing conversations and interactions that are going to allow for crisper and more effective conversations with their clients i think that will take some time to play out but when you think about it extraordinarily effective in terms of the interactions when there will be heightened proclivity to activity between the client and the fa whether its around an exogenous event or a life event for the fa to be well equipped to know what types of products and services might be available down the road is something that we think will be part of the embedded offering operator well take our last question from saul martinez with hsbc edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley saul good morning saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc good morning ph ted youve had pretty sustained good feebased asset flows for some time now and maybe this quarter was a little bit outside and sharon you mentioned the trends of advisorled brokerage moving into feebased clients diversifying to alternatives and fixed income instruments or fixed income can you just comment on the extent to which you think these dynamics have legs where we are in terms of these dynamics occurring given the strength in asset prices and equities and rates coming down and what that might mean for your flow expectations and for fee rates morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i actually really appreciate the question i appreciate that you took note of the comments that i gave in the prepared remarks which is what weve been focused on is really migration and understanding migration of assets so we look at theres brokerage accounts and selfdirected and theres brokerage accounts when you think about on the advisor side you have an advisor but you also have a brokerage count and not everything is in feebased the numbers from brokerage is those numbers are increasing in terms of whats actually migrating into fee based and why i think thats important is weve always said that we would expect oftentimes the way you see net new assets come into the institution they come in maybe under an advisor or not but lets say youre in the advisor side it comes into a brokerage account first it doesnt go directly into feebased and so its really the migration of assets coming in and then seeing that pick up say oh i understand that theres a value to advice and let me now figure out where id like to put it in what type of feebased wrapper so to speak that is going now if i go back sort of years or so it was really only in equities thats where you saw most of those fee based advice coming in now that has changed over time we began to talk about fixed income remember that had to do with some of we would talk about fee degradation wed say its not fee degradation but its mix and it was mix into fixed income now were seeing that mix also into alternatives so thats whats interesting is that there are more products also being offered under the feebased wrapper that people can begin to think about and as those products increase and we have more products than others we have more tools more opportunities for people to invest well see more assets come in theres more value to advice and there are more places to put it in when you think about the feebased offering so i think that it has momentum and as you know those are the durable revenue streams that we expect to gain over time saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thats helpful thanks a lot sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes
