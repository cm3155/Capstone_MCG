james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning everyone thank you for joining us and i know were starting a little later than some of the previous quarters so i appreciate you staying with us the firm performed well in a very uncertain and difficult environment an rotce of excluding integration expenses flexibility and strength of the business model wealth management pretax margin excluding integration expenses was and coupled with billion of net new assets demonstrates how this business even in a very volatile market environment and with indices morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 down over this year continues to attract new client assets and remains highly profitable this business is enormous scale and channel diversification should ensure continued success investment management and investment banking were clearly impacted by the market environment but as ive said elsewhere advisory and underwriting activity has not gone away it has simply been deferred fixed income and equities remains very solid with no areas of obvious concern both businesses navigated the complicated markets without serious incident finally the strength of our capital position is very clear as shown by the continuation of our strong buyback program with billion of share repurchases in this past quarter coupled that with a dividend yield north of and a cet1 ratio of on an operating basis this firm is doing well in a postcovid world from a market perspective we expect continued volatility as the federal reserve continues to tighten policy such to bring down inflation to acceptable longterm levels this is an environment where it behooves management to be prudent not balanced a wholesale retreat from the market is not called for but at the same time i must be more cautious in credit sensitive parts of the business fortunately the business model changes for the past decade or more plus the acquisitions of smith barney etrade and eaton vance put us in a position of significant relative strength and should support solid absolute performance in the months ahead ill now turn the call over to sharon to discuss the quarter in detail and together well take your questions sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the quarter our eps was and our rotce was excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was and our rotce was we built our business model to perform through the cycle and withstand volatile environments evidenced again by the performance this quarter in institutional securities fixed income benefited from macroeconomic developments and in wealth management we continue to attract strong net new assets underscoring the benefits of an advicedriven model and a variety of backdrops the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio was excluding integrationrelated expenses our yearto date efficiency ratio was ensuring future growth remains a priority and we continue to invest in techdriven efficiencies and with the abatement of covidrelated restrictions marketing and business development expenses have progressively normalized as our teams reengage with clients and our colleagues inperson efficiency remains an important performance objective and we review incremental spend on an ongoing basis now to the businesses institutional securities revenues were billion down from the robust prior year but seasonally strong rather for a seasonally slower quarter relative to historical levels strength in fixed income and equities was a counterbalance to muted activity and investment banking investment banking revenues decreased yearoveryear to billion with meaningful declines across products particularly underwriting ongoing market volatility continued to weigh on issuance and led clients to delay strategic actions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 advisory revenues were million solid results reflected the completion of previously announced strategic transactions revenues were down relative to the record prior year and in line with broader ma market volumes equity underwriting revenues were million with yearoveryear declines across products reflecting the overall volatility in global equity markets fixed income underwriting revenues were million investment grade issuance fared better issuers took advantage of favorable windows and investors demonstrated selectivity in a more challenging market we remain engaged with clients and strategic dialogues are active across multiple industry groups the eventual conversion to announcements is dependent on clarity around macroeconomic conditions including inflation growth and geopolitics as well as the stabilization of valuations equity revenues were billion the business performed well against the backdrop of equity market declines and volatility prime brokerage revenues decreased from last year results were impacted by lower average balances reflective of client deleveraging which was partially offset by the mix of client balances cash and derivative results declined versus the prior year as client activity moderated fixed income revenues of billion represented the highest third quarter in over a decade driven by strength across the macro complex macro revenues increased meaningfully versus the prior period inflationary pressure as well as central bank and fiscal activity drove volatility higher by extension changes in portfolios supported client engagement and increased flow trading activity benefiting rates and foreign exchange micro revenues were in line with the prior year revenues favored the americas more in the current period other revenues declined from the prior year and reflected a loss of million marktomarket losses on event and relationship loans net of hedges and movements in revenues related to deferred cashbased compensation contributed to the decrease turning to wealth management the business continues to deliver strong results despite the economic uncertainty revenues increased from the prior year to a robust billion as we continue to grow the more stable parts of our firm the rising rate environment supported net interest income more than offsetting the lower asset management and transactional revenues pretax profit was billion and the pbt margin was excluding integrationrelated expenses the pbt margin reached underscoring the resiliency of this business against the backdrop of declining asset values total net new assets were billion in the quarter bringing yeartodate net new assets to billion asset consolidation from existing clients net new clients workplace relationships and positive net recruiting were all sources of strength the growth of net new assets highlights the value of trusted advice especially through periods of market uncertainty our platform continues to attract advisors who recognize the integral role of the wealth management business of the firm and the value advisors gain by leveraging our technology and our products to best serve their clients transactional revenues of million declined from the prior period due to lower retail engagement and the impact of movements in revenues related to deferred compensation plans asset management revenues of billion primarily reflected lower market levels feebased flows were billion moderating from the robust levels seen in recent quarters suggesting retail hesitancy to invest in managed products and on certain markets morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 bank lending balances grew to billion and on a yeartodate basis balances have grown by billion rather this quarter balances have grown by billion the pace of loan growth slowed this quarter on the back of paydowns in securitiesbased lending and moderating mortgage growth total deposits declined by in the quarter to billion there was a shift in mix to higheryielding savings products as our expanded bank offering attracted clients investable cash net interest income was billion up nearly from the prior year in this accelerated rate hike cycle we have outperformed our model beta across our deposit portfolio which has more than offset the changing mix of our deposit base through the end of the year we would expect nii to remain broadly in line with the guidance provided last quarter noting that some of the rate benefit was pulled forward into the third quarter despite this period of heightened uncertainty and volatility we achieved consistent growth in wealth management we continue to deliver strong net new assets and demonstrate economies of scale with considerable growth opportunities ahead turning to investment management revenues of billion declined from the prior period substantially driven by lower asset values as well as the impact of outflows over the last year total aum ended at trillion long term net flows were approximately billion while equity strategies continue to see outflows the pace has moderated from recent quarters interest rate volatility negatively impacted fixed income flows however our broadened portfolio also delivered offsets inflows of billion into our alternative solutions platform were led by continued demand for parametric customized portfolios and our direct indexing and taxefficient investing capabilities as well as continued demand for private credit liquidity and overlay services had outflows of billion clients likely relocated money market holdings to alternative riskfree assets asset management and related fees were billion the impact of lower average aum led to the yearoveryear decline performancebased income and other revenues were a net loss of million primarily driven by the markdown of a single underlying public investment in one of our asia private equity funds investments in the business and the integration of eaton vance continue to progress well we are investing in products and vehicles that will allow us to deliver solutions to a broader set of clients our strategic focus on secular growth areas such as alternatives and direct indexing supported by our ability to globally distribute products positions us well to perform through the cycle turning to the balance sheet standardized rwas were relatively flat ending the quarter at billion prudent management of resources was partially offset by an increase due to market volatility during the third quarter we also bought back billion of stock taking advantage of our current valuation and utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization oci related to our availableforsale securities portfolio reflected unrealized losses of billion while this should be earned back over time it reduced our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter our standardized cet1 ratio was approximately basis points above our regulatory requirement inclusive of buffers as of october capital remains critical to our strategy particularly in this rapidly evolving backdrop our tax rate was for the quarter down from the third quarter of last year primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits we now expect that our full year tax rate will be approximately looking ahead the broader economic outlook remains uncertain while we cannot be sure how the market dynamics will play out we remain confident in our strategy particularly our ability to aggregate client assets and wealth management support our institutional clients and deliver diversified solutions and investment management all while prudently managing our capital profile and focusing on our strategic goals with that we will now open up the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 question and answer section operator we are now ready to taking questions operator instructions well go first to ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so james you alluded to a lot of cross currents i fully appreciate that i think from your shareholders perspective i think why folks own morgan stanley is some degree of confidence on the superior roe defensibility of that roe just talk to us as you think about the i mean weve already seen a ton of market volatility as we look forward your confidence where return on tangible equity how defensible do you think that is and understanding the quartertoquarter volatility but how defensible do you think that is and remind us about the synergies from eaton vance etrade et cetera that we should be mindful of when we think about morgan stanleys growth relative to what happens to the market thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley great well thats a good broader question to kick it off i would say first of all were thrilled with the deals we did with etrade and eaton vance i mean theyve both worked better than expectations in eaton vance for example the gem that is parametric as just the gift that keeps giving etrade with the deposits that we brought over through that deal what weve done with the stock plan business is now combined with ours of the sp companies and obviously having a digital banking platform ive often described etrade its a technology company and we brought a lot of technology with that so just on those two things thrilled with it in terms of the overall environment and how we plan that environment maybe ill just touch on the environment for a minute it shouldnt be surprising whats going on in the market im kind of surprised every time i see somebody on tv who seems surprised by it we had zero interest rates for a decade we have massive monetary and fiscal stimulus we have the first land war in europe in years the highest inflation in years and the fed had to move now my opinion was they moved late but they moved and theyre going to keep moving and rates are now around theyre probably going to go mid but that remains to be determined and with that there will be consequences so far we havent seen clarity around inflation abating my guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year and i think the fed will be successful in this journey but thats a gut from all the numbers im looking at but it doesnt mean im going to be right the world obviously remains volatile youre going to see some disruption were seeing it some of the more ridiculous stuff thats been in the market in the last few years company is trading at times revenues whats going on with bitcoin trade at morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 some of the whats going on in some of the games stop and other companies where theres been these sort of aberration type trading i mean thats been washed out and thats okay were back to sort of fundamentals so how does morgan stanley play in that investment management obviously gets hurt when fees are down because asset prices are down but im not i dont think were in a longterm financial depreciation so im not particularly concerned about that as ive said the banking pipeline and underwriting gets deferred people dont stop doing deals in fact there was a deal announced this morning and therell be much more deals as we get closer to economic clarity our sales and trading businesses remain robust we are holding share in those i feel very good about that and a lot of that business is actually repeatable if you think of prime brokerage its actually very stable and with wealth management we brought in billion of new money in one of the most difficult quarters that weve had in years i mean that would have been unthinkable even two years ago so the fact our clients are continuing to bring us money and the funnel of all the ways the money comes in the door is working thats not an accident thats a business model design so im really happy with the way thats working out so in aggregate honestly im pretty relaxed i mean our cet1 around were required to have i think and i dont know if that answers your question we could probably spend all day talking about it but the environment is difficult but we are not under stress ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no it did and just one quick followup to that at the same time youve shown a tendency to lean and be opportunistic eaton vance etrade a lot of disruption among your peers both here in europe like how do you think about just morgan stanley leaning in to actually gain share in this backdrop james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well i think youve got to keep investing and we are not making major cutbacks across the plant i mean im sure sharon will talk about expenses in a minute were obviously being prudent but we dont see any reason for great draconian measures weve built a business model and in times like this is when if you can sustain it you actually do very well coming out the other side so i feel pretty good about our relative position to be honest operator well take our next question from christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning maybe sharon on the deposits i hear your comments on deposit mix shift but swift deposits were down i think qonq which i think is the worst quarter decline by significant margin so im a little surprised that you said deposit beta is in line with expectations i guess my question is how are you now thinking about your guide for terminal deposits beta is that still realistic given the fed is still hiking and obviously the pacier of sweep deposit decline sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 sure so let me just take them and separate them a little so the change that you saw in mix of deposits you actually what we saw is we have i would label it as transactional cash and investable cash the transactional cash is the sweep deposits that youre talking about and as james said with the expanded bank offering which was also aided by etrade we have more diversified products than weve ever had before and in fact what weve seen is the savings account that we offer is those other deposits is where those that investable cash is going when its new to the bank so from the aggregate standpoint morgan stanley actually has the vast majority of its deposits is coming from the wealth management system this is important when you compare it to the last period that youre talking about because that actually wasnt the case so we had sweep deposits we had some savings in cds but a big chunk of that was actually wholesale deposits that was coming from outside so what james has said with us being able to attract these new assets these are new assets that are sitting at morgan stanley that over time can be deployed as you think about either different investment opportunities or different transactional opportunities so as it relates to deposit beta we are outperforming the deposit beta that weve modeled which is where that nii is still coming from so nii as you know christian is going to be made of three different things the deposit beta the actual deposit mix and then loan growth and taken together thats still propelling nii to where it was this quarter christian bolu q analyst autonomous research okay hear you maybe on just leverage lending and the bridge book can you speak to your balance sheet risk appetite you guys seem to be on a number of sort of like hung deals citrix twitter et cetera so first of all how big is your bridge book or leverage loan book however you want to characterize it and then second are you increasing your risk appetite here to capture opportunities and then how are you thinking about managing that risk sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so broadly speaking id say weve been extremely prudent in terms of risk management i think thats most notable actually when you think about our rwas and just our capital position so weve been looking at different riskbased metrics really over time and bringing them down over the course of the year so thats for the entire institution just knowing that weve entered into what feels like a more volatile period and as you think about those different relationships indiscernible net of hedges over the course of this quarter they actually were quite modest marks given the environment operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there thank you so maybe a followup on the deposit conversation im curious you have these expanded offerings you have the provided savings accounts how do you monitor and how do you guide client behavior and is the goal at all costs indiscernible deposits inhouse even if the cost of those deposits is a lot higher than sitting in a brokerage account im just curious on the how to morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley the intention of course is to give the clients opportunities and choice glenn as you know which has been our position over the course of the last god knows how long but the intention is to give them as many offerings as possible and yes as you said if we can bring those assets in and give them an opportunity to have a savings account or we can issue cds or as youve always talked about we have other types of things such as alternatives what it does is it brings those assets inhouse and then in a point where they want to be deployed into the marketplace we can do that as it relates to what we might necessarily give to different deposits it would be of course again related to those transactional versus investable cash glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi maybe staying on wealth youve been very successful at growing your securitiesbased loan book i think of those as extremely lowrisk to morgan stanley but the backed by securities and securities of all types have fallen a lot so im curious if you can comment on how big is the book will it still grow and how are you managing the whole margin call situation just to get a marktomarket on that thatd be great sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so we have seen paydowns specifically this quarter so just in terms of the actual book but in terms of the risk which you highlight weve always said its really more of an operational risk than anything else we have obviously seen margin calls and theyve all been handled very well over the course of the quarter so we havent seen any issues there and in addition to that i think when you look at the ltvs what we noticed when we have those we obviously look at that data internally and it is very much in line with the longerdated historical average and for this quarter it was over the course of the quarter on average was in line with last quarter as well so i think that book remains very well managed means a great opportunity and option for our client base and of course it will just be dependent on the environment itself operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to drill in a little bit sharon to the comments that you made around deposit betas and deposits and whats been changing in the mix for you all that all makes a lot of sense i think that theres clear benefits to having deposits much more oriented to the wealth management business and it helps to watch that mix between the sweep and other but the idea that the nii guide is essentially unchanged and you had million growth quarteroverquarter that suggests that basically nii is going to be flat into so is that have we hit given the dynamics given you have more wealthier clients and you have more of their cash and so you theres if you want to keep that funding which is of course more attractive than wholesale then youre going to have to pay for it in those savings accounts and so therefore is it just and with loan growth slowing is it just right to just assume that okay nii this is probably like the stable level of nii for at least the foreseeable future as we head into or will we hit a point where youll be able to continue to see some resume some growth and weve just entered this transition period how should we think about it a little bit longer term morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i think i mean the truth is i think well have to see right so youre right in your assumption that thats basically what it implies in terms of the quarteroverquarter for nii obviously we havent given guidance yet and the reason i mean aside from the fact that we generally give guidance in january but aside from that the guidance would obviously also take into place what is actually happening with the deposit mix and i do think that this is obviously is an accelerated rate hike cycle the deposit behavior is still playing out but the intention here is really to make sure that we have these deposits inhouse and they will continue to be deployed into the marketplace over time so thats the balance that one is trying to achieve when you think about that deposit mix and what were actually doing from a great bank and growth perspective on the loan side i think that again where you see the positivity is these are environmental factors right so when you think of household penetration from our fas into different mortgage and lending products those things continue to rise so what youre focused on which is completely fair is really going to be dependent largely on the environment itself how quickly you see rates move and then how you see deposit behavior play out over time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay that is all totally fair thanks for that color second question would be on the levfin book theres definitely some increased focus there you referenced some marks through the institutional business on the other line which wasnt that surprising given the environment but how are you thinking about managing those risks there still is some inventory that the street broadly is going to need to work through and investor appetite has been weak and so how have you hedged that book how should we be thinking about those risks going forward and how are you continuing to manage it thank you sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley clearly prudent disciplined risk management and i think that the marks that youve seen so far underscores and underlines that i think that the other point that i would just mention as we think about the outlook perspective what you saw over the course of the third quarter was that the market and issuers and others are very opportunistic as it relates to windows and its a windowspecificdriven market and so when you do see positive windows and we saw it in august and we saw in early september you do see movement and so one is watching that calendar as you think through that and i think were looking for those market receptivities and for those favorable windows james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just add to it i mean theres obviously been a lot of talk about this here and a couple of names in particular and we cant talk about individual names as much as im sure youd all like us to by the way theyre not hung deals until theyre actually out there but put that aside about a year ago a little over a year ago we turned quite conservative brennan we across the whole plant we pulled in a little bit and we pulled in with our margin book particularly our asian margin book we looked across our whole prime brokerage platform and we pulled in a little bit with certain clients there and weve been quite cautious in the leverage finance arena and somebody mentioned one transaction citrix were actually a small player in that so were not its not like weve been large in this space which might account for morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 the fact in the other line which is incorporates a bunch of things including loan losses the number actually is very modest i think it was like negative ph million and there are a few pluses in there and minuses but the aggregate picture is not that frankly its just not that troubling well remain cautious as i said in my sort of opening comments particularly in credit sensitive areas were a big institution we serve a lot of clients you dont get this perfect but i feel actually pretty good about the way weve navigated this so far so stay tuned to it operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to followup on the wealth side in terms of organic growth the feebased growth did slow a bit and i think sharon you mentioned some decisionmaking maybe being a little bit more challenged or slowdown in this type of backdrop but maybe could you just talk more broadly about the channels that youre seeing growth in both the total flows as well as maybe whats where the rate of change might be either the biggest or slowest whether thats through existing advisors workplace in the various funnels that you have out there sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think thats a really great question because i think it is pretty remarkable to see billion of assets in a quarter such as this one it is coming from different parts of the funnel specifically though the advicebased channel is the one aggregating the most at this point in time versus the selfdirected itself which isnt surprising but whats so interesting about the advicebased channel is its a existing and new clients yes but also were beginning to see more and more referrals and more and more anecdotes and stories where you actually see the assets thats coming through the advicebased channel is actually coming through different referrals that we might have seen from the actual workplace relationships and so weve been spending a lot of time when you look at workplace and finding a way to a provide better content and more content to various employers specifically in this environment which is very very well received and number two sort of point is that when you think about the fa weve talked a lot about how to match various fas within the workplace the more and more referrals and the more and more data we have whos able to monetize those referrals the better and better it is and so were seeing that continue to pick up and then from a workplace perspective we also have integrated various relationship managers that we might have seen with the workplace into the actual fa teams all of those things taken together is coming through from an nna perspective the advisorbased channel but its clearly a positivity if you sort of think of the rate of change where some of that might be coming from so i think very proud of the results on the net new assets side daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 okay and then just to followup on expenses you broadly obviously talked about being focused on efficiency but is there anything specific you can point to that youre doing differently or thinking about as you start budgeting for next year or even as we go into the fourth quarter that from a rate of change that youre focused on sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley well id say that weve been focused on expenses well all year i mean were always focused on expenses but very much in the spring of this year weve been taking and i spoke about it in the last two earnings call a very hard look at all of the expenses and just continuing to manage them on an individual project level understanding where all the costs are coming from and also understanding where the growth is coming from were balancing that of course with the need to continue to invest not only on the business side but also continuing to make sure that the infrastructure and controls are there as you think about expanding the business so its really around foundational side where some of those expenses might also be coming through as you think about technology migration et cetera so its just its tactical in nature as well as this holistic approach of just making sure that youre very cognizant but its certainly part of something that were thinking through as we look at the budgeting perspective james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley we also i mean obviously were looking at head count i mean were youve got to take into account the rate of growth weve had in the last few years and weve learned some things during covid about how we can operate more efficiently so thats something that the management team is working between now and the end of the year and again we want to provide growth opportunities across the platform but weve also identified some efficiencies so over time that will become clearer operator well go next to devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking the questions i want to start on fixed income trading obviously revenues have been quite healthy in the volatile rate environment with customers moving around their portfolios as you guys noted been a long time since weve seen these levels of rates so im curious how you guys are thinking about what a higher for longer environment looks like for fixed income trading once rates settle in im assuming more movement in yield on an absolute basis could be helpful but would it be great to get your views from any historical context or just broader expectations sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely its interesting i think when we looked at the beginning of this year and we said okay how do you think about the fixed income environment what stood out isnt just the absolute level of rates but its also the dispersion of whats going on in different economies so if you think if you go back a decade and you had all rates at zero for every economy and all of a sudden youve moved to a place where you have divergent views obviously also driving foreign exchange for example so i think all of that taken together is one that we keep looking at morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 its clear that should that continue thats a place where one would expect higher volatility and therefore by definition likely higher client engagement and so as we go forward thats clearly something that were looking at but thats how i would reflect where the fixed income market is right now versus where its been say years ago devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay thanks just a quick followup here also just on kind of corporate ma opportunities obviously evaluations across financials and fintech are down pretty dramatically over the last year and so im curious whether youre seeing more maybe opportunities emerge maybe things you were looking for but just more sellers potentially coming to market just given some of the challenging macro that were seeing and also the big change in valuations over the last nine months to a year james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i mean youre going to see a little bit of a washout in some of the fintech space i mean this is reality youve seen companies trading at valuations which god we could only dream of over here and our modest little house but theyre just not reality and that washes out youll see consolidation a lot of these businesses are scale driven businesses we have enormous technology requirements to support cyber and stop client fraud and data control and management and so on so consolidation is the key word at these prices i think the sellers are only there if they need to sell theyre probably holding out for something a little more balanced and maybe if my projection is right that sort of end of next year so in the fintech space generally consolidation across financial services has been the catchword for a decade and weve moved aggressively to be at the front of that and i think thats just reflecting reality scale matters operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi first one just general question can you just give more details on your tech spending how much youre spending what thats growing how much is to change the bank i know ive asked you before about how much of your workload you look to move to the cloud maybe how many apps you have just a little bit more meat on the bones i appreciated the wealth expo that you held in june i recognize the cost avoidance that youve achieved with the acquisition of etrade now your backbone is complete your tech backbone but these are kind of highlevel tech comments that youve made so any public comments that you can give to put more meat on the bones would be appreciated james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley why dont i take that mike i think we dont publicly break out tech and maybe well do more of that through next year but i would say just to give you some sense of sort of what the focus is obviously moving to the cloud was a big deal and you saw the deals that we did in that all of the innovation thats taking place in the financial advisor channel the next best action the virtual advisors all of technology and i think you probably saw some of that the work weve done around workplace solium is basically a tech company etrade is a tech company morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 building a workplace platform that doesnt revolve around a financial intermediary but all of it goes straight from stock plans straight into vested etrade accounts were doing a bunch of work we just reviewed our electronic trading platform in equities and what theyre doing in equities and fixed income and some of the opportunities to leverage the derivatives trading within the etrade platform with our electronic trading within our equities group and a lot of stuff were doing around cyber data protection data management ai is a huge effort we have a group of people distinguished engineers which we appoint each year a group of very sophisticated technology software engineers and designers and we had indiscernible just welcomed him actually last week i think it was so enormous amount going on i mean to your base question tech spend is going up i think its fair to say along with some of our controls and compliance areas its the fastestgrowing part of this firm but thats good because its displacing things we will be doing manually which we shouldnt be doing manually so im perfectly happy to see our tech spend go up a lot of it is around new innovation but were also running a plant which is driving billion in revenue and theres just basic tech infrastructure that we keep modernizing that is the backbone of that plant so hopefully that gives you a bit of a sense mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right maybe drive specifics in another area you have billion of inflows to wealth in a tough market noted but i see the definition of inflows has changed over the last year to also include dividends interest and asset acquisitions thats from the note in the earnings supplement so how much of the billion of inflows to wealth were related to dividends interest and asset acquisitions sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley it was i just would highlight there are no asset acquisitions this quarter and the dividends and interest was always included ph by definition james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah thats i mean to my knowledge thats not a change that has happened at least in the last two decades operator well go next to jeremy sigee with bnp paribas jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom thank you you talked about etrade and workplace and the multichannel business model which i think is very powerful i just wanted to ask is that all bedded down now is that fully operational humming along or are there any major integration steps or implementation steps still to be done sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so last time integration i talked about this actually in the call in january there will be a back office conversion that well see in but thats the most major thing that we have left to be done as well as over the course of morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 the fourth quarter we will expect something in terms of integration expense specifically from an etrade perspective that will look similar to the third quarter jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom and in terms of referral between the channels that capability thats fully happening already thats in place its happening all the capability is there sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah im sorry i misunderstood the question you were talking specifically about the integration expenses and how we were thinking about that from a referral perspective i would say theres still a lot more that will continue to be done so were just scratching the surface of that entire those relationships and bringing those funnels together what i mentioned for example as you think about the referral programs thats just beginning right so the better data that we have amongst whos the best fa to refer to to refer a workplace relationship to that will just continue as you kind of better understand and aggregate data remember weve invested a lot in the capabilities that you would consider ai in nature to give you a better sense of what does someone do with his or her next stock plan distribution for example do they buy a house do they need a mortgage okay what happens at this stage in someones lifecycle so the more and more data that we aggregate across all of these channels the more and more powerful the wealth management business becomes so to james point around the technology investment that technology investment is core to be able to continue to grow the business with what weve called that we discussed this project genome before james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just repeat something that andy saperstein said at one of the recent conferences that our plan is to generate trillion of new money new client money every three years so its billion obviously in a very difficult environment like this that run rate is more challenging but weve had quarters where weve been much higher than where we are now so its about call it billion a little more billion a quarter and in this quarter we did billion that is an unbelievable number if you think about trillion we generate over basis points basis points per dollar of assets so that is an unbelievable revenue machine and there are many many factors contributing to it it is a completely different business model because of workplace because of the direct channels because of what weve done with the bank and the way weve changed the whole financial advisory interaction with their clients through technology so very exciting this path that were on and its heading towards what ive said my longterm goal here is trillion in clients money basis points is a billion business and thats the target were heading for and thats where were going to go operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning james you mentioned that obviously its no real surprise the market conditions as you described some of the issues weve confronted this year and obviously capital raising is going to come back morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 at some point can you guys give us a little further color on your pipelines of what youre seeing possibly for the fourth quarter and as we go into the first of next year in the investment banking and trading areas sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley the pipelines are solid the activity i think whats interesting is continues to be across a diversified base of different companies so its not just about one sector in particular but as james and i highlighted i think its really around that macroeconomic factors and thats geopolitics et cetera but what it really ends up doing is it creates uncertainty in the cost of capital and in valuation which therefore also impacts price discovery and so thats kind of the whats the clincher in terms of this realization of what remains a solid pipeline gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc do you think your clients are more realistic about that price discovery today sharon versus maybe six months ago sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that people are digesting the various prices and i do think that youre beginning to see that on say an issuance perspective right so if you think about the cost of capital that also took people time to or rather companies time to digest and understand that we are in a different regime where treasuries are and so it means that their cost of capital is also higher and you might not have necessarily seen issuance right away because those corporate balance sheets were there and now you might see an opportunistic or more prudent behavior from a treasurer or cfo and so i think that as that mindset begins to shift and yes over time the valuation mindset begins to shift as well james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i mean im on the road a lot and i see a lot of ceos i mean i think the ceos of sort of established or on the path to established companies are getting very realistic and they want to get on with business i mean you cant sit on your hands forever youve got to figure out always a better way to do business and the environment its wonderful if you have zero interest rates but thats unsustainable so weve moved to a normalized and obviously were going to go a little higher than that to beat inflation back but people are adjusting to that i think the ones that are struggling still companies that private companies that were valued at lets just say spotty levels and theyre doing new rounds and theyre finding theyre just not paid at the same and thats hard to accept as an entrepreneur its their baby and they want to believe that its what it was at the peak and maybe it was valued at the peak thats just what profiting markets do and again some of these public companies that have traded down from their offering price because were in a different environment and money has got more expensive morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 so those groups will take longer to adjust but this is sort of real politic around core businesses that have been around for a while they adjust pretty quickly i mean we all get it weve all been through different cycles you get a little lucky in certain cycles where things are really cheap and then you got to move a little harder and a little faster when things arent and weve done deals in both kinds of cycles
