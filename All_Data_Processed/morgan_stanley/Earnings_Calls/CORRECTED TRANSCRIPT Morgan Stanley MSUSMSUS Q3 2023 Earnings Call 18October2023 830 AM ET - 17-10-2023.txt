disclaimers this call is being recorded during todays presentation we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement copies of which are available at morganstanleycom todays presentation may include forwardlooking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially morgan stanley does not undertake to update the forwardlooking statements in this discussion please refer to our notices regarding forwardlooking statements and nongaap measures that appear in the earnings release this presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent i will now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you good morning everyone thanks all for joining us as anticipated the market environment in aggregate remained mixed continuing a pattern weve seen over the past several quarters notwithstanding the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 net result for morgan stanley was we generated a little over billion in revenues billion in net income and rotce of concerns around the tight employment market high commodity prices inflationary pressures that may impact fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter but we are seeing increasing evidence of ma and underwriting calendars that are building and while we expect momentum to continue this year given the fourth quarter has some seasonal considerations we expect most of the activity to materialize in meanwhile its our job to control what we can control firstly we successfully completed the etrade integration this quarter that was a massive undertaking and the expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the pl for a couple of years and involved us migrating million accounts onto our platform and honestly it went incredibly well really a seamless performance by the team this conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy building revenue synergies across channels and attracting clients to our bestinclass advice offering secondly on the capital front we bought back billion in stock we averaged a nearly dividend yield over the quarter and at the same time delivered a cet1 ratio at which is basis points over our most recent regulatory requirement we clearly have a significant capital buffer also you saw the full details of the initial basel iii endgame proposal as you all know this is a proposal not the final regulation im going to repeat that its a proposal there is an enormous amount of energy being spent conversations being had across industry groups and agency board members and ive been deeply involved myself along with sharon yeshaya and weve been told many times that the federal reserve strongly welcomes comments on this proposal given this i anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before its adopted as a final rule let me be crystal clear because of the buffers we have built even if this proposal were implemented today as written we have adequate capital to the meet the ultimate requirement needless to say therere many years between now and then in the quarter wealth management generated net new assets of billion thats obviously below recent quarters its consistent with what ive been saying for a long time these numbers will bounce around and in any quarterly period therere always idiosyncratic things this year weve had two quarters where we had some surprise on the upside and in aggregate for the year were totaling net new assets of billion yeartodate our annualized growth rate is at the high end of the to range that weve been looking at and its consistent in fact its spoton with our threeyear target of trillion for net new money overall this firm is in excellent shape notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in my hope and expectation is to hand over morgan stanley with as clean a slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months im very excited about the future of this firm its leadership its strategy and its culture and ill now turn it over to sharon who can discuss the quarter in greater detail and then together as always well take your questions thank you sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the quarter our eps was and our rotce was results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio was together severance and dcp impacted the yeartodate efficiency ratio by nearly basis points as we invest for growth our integration efforts have remained a priority integration morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 related expenses were million in the third quarter and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter as previously communicated now to the businesses institutional securities revenues were billion declining versus the prior year equity and fixed income results were in line with longterm historical averages investment banking revenues remained depressed on lower volume however leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progressed positively evidenced by a notable increase of morgan stanleys announced volumes in the third quarter on a year overyear basis investment banking revenues decreased to million the change to the previous year was driven by lower results in advisory and debt underwriting advisory revenues of million reflected a decline in completed transactions due to lower announced volumes in prior periods despite the weaker quarterly results we continue to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern equity underwriting revenues were million overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages while increased confidence supported early september issuances a hawkish tone from the federal reserve and resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains windowdriven fixed income underwriting revenues were million down versus the prior year primarily reflecting lower noninvestment grade events we are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bakeoff activity across sectors and geographies the pickup in our announced ma volumes in the third quarter speaks to the trends weve observed at the end of the last quarter but the landscape continues to evolve as we look ahead corporate confidence will largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs while risks remain including geopolitical threats the underlying trends suggest activity is building and there is a desire among clients to pursue their longterm strategic objectives equity revenues were billion the business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in europe and asia prime brokerage revenues were solid client balances were modestly higher compared to last year the results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances cash revenues declined versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes derivative results increased yearoveryear reflecting higher client activity with particular strength in europe fixed income revenues were billion micro results increased versus the prior year supported by strength in securitized products both in agency and nonagency trading macro revenues decreased versus last years elevated results with lower revenues in rates and foreign exchange results reflect lower client conviction particularly around the future of central bank policy commodity revenues increased yearoveryear on the back of a constructive trading environment particularly for oil other revenues of million improved versus last year driven by lower marktomarket losses on corporate loans net of loan hedges and higher net interest income and fees turning to isg lending and provisions the allowance for credit losses in isg loans and lending commitments increased slightly to billion in the quarter isg provisions were million the increase was driven by a continued negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector net chargeoffs were million primarily related to one commercial real estate loan in the office sector turning to wealth management revenues of billion were strong and increased from the prior year the growth of asset management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income underscoring their durability as designed our assetled strategy drives steady feebased flows that support asset management revenues with this in mind we remain focused on asset migration into our advisorled channel this quarter our morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 longterm strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our etrade integration successfully converting nearly billion of client aum onto the morgan stanley platform this will continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisors and seamlessly transition them into advicebased relationships moving onto the business metrics in the third quarter pretax profit was billion and the pbt margin was integration expense as well as dcp negatively impacted the margin by approximately basis points net new assets were billion bringing yeartodate nna to billion which represents over annualized growth of beginning period assets net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net recruiting into the advisorled channel the multiyear buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our advisorled channel evidenced by feebased flows of billion in the third quarter alone asset management revenues of billion increased yearoveryear higher average assets and the impact of cumulative positive feebased flows over the past year drove the increase transactional revenues excluding dcp were million up yearoveryear results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail clients into alternatives particularly into private equity and private credit bank lending balances were roughly flat versus the prior quarter growth in mortgages and tailored lending offset paydowns in securitiesbased lending total deposits of billion remained stable compared to the prior quarter still the deposit mix has shifted as clients continue to allocate rate sensitive cash to higher yielding cash alternatives available on the platform including our expanded savings offering in addition the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment net interest income was billion the sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix looking towards the rest of this year based on where we exited the quarter we expect nii to trend lower the magnitude will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates wealth management business model is focused on steady asset aggregation delivering strong solutions and advice to clients while growing durable fees and expanding margin through the cycle we are continuing to invest in our industryleading position and the sustainability of our longterm growth as the backdrop recovers advisors remain wellpositioned to capture greater asset opportunity supported by our multichannel model that was built to attract new client relationships turning to investment management revenues of billion increased compared to the prior year supported by higher asset management revenues total aum ended at trillion longterm net outflows of approximately billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our msim active equity growth strategies which continue to see redemptions consistent with the industry excluding these segments outflows yeartodate longterm flows across the franchise were slightly positive within alternatives and solutions we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies a partial offset to the headwinds of the quarter liquidity and overlay services had net flows of billion driven by demand for parametric institutional portfolio overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies specific to parametric and across the entire franchise overlay and longterm net flows in the quarter were almost billion underscoring strong trends in this business asset management and related fees were billion up yearoveryear on higher average aum performance based income and other revenues were million supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light platform results were driven by gains in us private equity offset by weakness in asia private equity and real estate our strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place ongoing investments in our businesses including our marketleading parametric franchise as well as our continued growth in innovation in private markets position us well to best serve our clients morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 turning to the balance sheet our cet1 ratio stands at roughly flat versus last quarter standardized rwas declined sequentially to billion reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market movements at the end of the quarter we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders buying back billion of common stock during the quarter taken in the context of the mixed environment we are pleased with the firms resiliency and our competitive positioning as clients gain more conviction we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities particularly in investment banking this increased client conviction will also further support asset growth in wealth and investment management we will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies all while prudently managing our capital profile with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well go first to christian bolu with autonomous research christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning james and sharon i wanted to just touch on wealth management a bit of a longerterm question here as you mentioned youve enjoyed really strong organic growth in that segment over the last few years but it doesnt appear to be translating to revenue growth if i look at the wealth management revenues excluding nii it hasnt really grown in three years despite gathering significant amount of assets so curious how youre thinking about the flowthrough from aum or asset growth to revenues and then maybe more broadly how are you thinking about the unit economics of your asset gathering strategy sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure actually i think that interestingly enough christian im pretty impressed with the resiliency that weve seen in the business this is literally the explanation of the funnel that weve talked about if you look back over the course of the last year alone billion of assets that weve captured then look at the feebased flows right we continue to see increased feebased flows this past year if you exclude the asset acquisitions that we had over the last couple of years we are basically at some of the historical highs of seeing feebased growth as we move forward youre looking at times since covid where we obviously had very high retail engagement and youve been able to offset even with a decline in nii offset those growth to asset base asset management revenues as you move forward its that that we are trying to grow were trying to continue to grow our asset management fees over time and make sure that we have the right solutions in place to offer our clients now lets take that forward we have this mixed environment youve of our retail client assets sitting in cash that is higher right from the on historical averages weve begun to see retail investors put their cash into markets the last four months consecutively weve seen that movement into the market this quarter alone we began to see alternative growth in the new products the growth in transactional revenues we havent seen that since the first quarter of before you started this rate hike cycle so in my mind actually the strategy is working pretty darn well especially if you think about how weve been able to aggregate assets migrate morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 them into feebased flows look at transactional and see that grow and see growth in these new products and deliver them to our clients all while these clients have dry powder to invest as these markets turn christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks sharon maybe my followup is just thinking about your rotce targets over time of the quarter was fine is nothing to sniff at but it is some ways off that how should we think about the bridge from here i know youve mentioned investment banking but its like a fairly small part of your business so whats the bridge to how much of it is macro how much of it is selfhelp and for what is macro what sort of operating backdrop are you looking for thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley christian maybe id take that given sharon just pummeled you and i want to give you a little bit of a break here by the way the only thing id add to what sharon said is when people have a choice of making return by doing nothing theyre not going to be trading in the markets so the actual secondary lines in the revenues are the lowest ive seen for years in the last couple years as rates do eventually come down they will come down i dont think next year but theyll come down after that youll see more activity in that regard and naturally youll see more money go up in the sweep so interestingly theres kind of an optimal point where rates are attractive for investors but not so high they keep them out of the market and not so high that there isnt money kept on sweep so very different from the checking account phenomena you see at some of the commercial banks but back to the i mean id just say as you know we actually we were at so its not this is not a this would not be a remarkable achievement like when i first came to morgan stanley and people asked me if the wealth management business could generate in those days margins and i said well there are two people already doing it so its pretty obvious it can be done so weve done it and nothing structurally has changed if anything the firms got stronger weve been investing a lot i mean this etrade deal was there was a lot of investment to get that integration done we decided to keep investing through the cycle on the funnel in wealth because we think over the next years thats going to pay monster dividends the integration across all the eaton vance platforms they were never really integrated as one platforms across the different indiscernible parametric and eaton vance and now sorting through all of that which dan has done a great job of doing and then frankly banking has been really weak i mean under billion is evidence of a very weak calendar and very weak ma and the pipeline we saw this quarter was really strong so i dont think the announcements wont translate into revenues in  but they will in   next year so just on the math i think if were running about billion wed have to generate about another million net a quarter just on the expense management we could do things on expenses easily more than weve done and if you get a couple hundred million from that and then on the revenue side as banking recovers some of the transaction stuff were just talking about and sharon pointed out of these assets moving to annuitized product and then i think fed will move up from this point youd pretty easily get to the so i appreciate the question and im not concerned about that longterm outlook i think it has happened and will happen again and frankly wont be that long operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore isi morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so first one on wealth management and then nii i mean the trends i think were in the range of whats been happening across the industry so not overly surprising but im curious if you could break down even qualitatively how much of that a sweep movement is coming in historical morgan stanley versus etrade im just trying to see what type of client is moving and then to go back you peaked my interest james in the comment you just made about not next year but maybe after that what conditions do you think we need for wealth management and nii to stable and grow sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so lets take the first question which is the two different types of deposit mix youre right if you think about the selfdirected client versus a advisorybased client that weve had in the historical wealth management franchise one has proven to be somewhat of a stickier deposit base than you would see on the wealth management side and i think what i would say is the traditional wealth management side that we had historically had so that does provide you with a sense of whats going on in terms of which client base is seeing that on the potential growth of nii going forward again thats part of the same asset gathering strategy some proportion of these assets as they come over be that into the selfdirected or the advicebased relationship will be held in some sort of transactional cash so that will be supportive over time of nii to some degree from a deposit perspective but that also provides us with lending capabilities and opportunities as you know glenn weve seen tremendous what we would call sort of household penetration in being able to offer new lending products to our various client bases obviously with the sbl product we continue to see mortgages and growth in mortgages even in this rate environment for new purchases in homes as we better understand our client base were able to do that more and actually bringing together this etrade acquisition putting everything on the same portfolio and the same franchise from a technology perspective is foundational in being able to integrate all of those bank relationships and what we used to call the bank rails that etrade had for a broader wealth offering that should also help support nii as we look into the future james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i think i dont know on the second bit i just think theres an optimal point i mean we went from zero rates to in effectively the fastest period since the early fastest rate increase whats remarkable is we havent had a recession by the way and i personally dont think were going to but with that i mean if youre an adviser and youve got a client sitting on a lot of cash earning zero i would hope youre telling them to put it in treasuries or something so thats exactly whats happened at around to it becomes a different kind of discussion so i think theres a trigger point and youre seeing it across as you said the whole industry and thats why youre seeing a different behavior set for people in checking accounts so they havent gotten advised they money is sitting in the checking account if theyre not paying attention theyre still getting i dont know basis points or something so as rates come down the total cash we have in the book which is will be coming down anyway because thats an abnormality related to where rates are right now as rates come down over the next couple of years youre actually going to see people much less price sensitive on what theyre generating in a return on the cash and just using it as a liquidity account to manage investments going in and out morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 so i think in some ways we overachieved relative to our particular business mix so im quite encouraged about the future because of that i think in fact youre hearing some of that language coming out of the banks when they said i forget what words some of the other ceos said but it was effectively the same theyve overachieved and that its sitting in checking accounts and theyre making enormous amount of money on that but thats unsustainable weve overachieved and the rates are so high everybody want to be in cash earning not cash sitting dormant i dont know if that makes sense to you glenn by the way i have to say i did love your comment about for all the talk about green shoots somebody forgot to water them id give you that one glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats better than a pummel thank you one quick one maybe ill get the pummel on this one i know its the board decision but so long as the ceo transition announcement takes place is there any timeframe where it starts to put more strain on the organization or become a distraction as every reporter in the world is writing on it every day james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah about three years from now no listen glenn come on weve said i would not be ceo i said at the annual meeting i wouldnt be ceo within a year and i said that for a very simple reason that people didnt believe that i was going to leave because apparently bank ceos dont and i said i would and when i say im going to do something im definitely going to do it i would leave at the earliest possible moment that the board feels comfortable making that decision and i made that very clear to them i think theyve done a terrific job now that youve opened up the question ill answer it more broadly theyve done a terrific job dennis nally and the succession committee and tom glocer lead director on the board all the directors engaged really thorough process and where i dont want to give an exact time because thats sort of a spoiler i already did that apparently talking about logan roy once shall i say were well in and i do believe there are diminishing returns at some point in time were not there the team is doing great the businesses are moving forward but yeah i want to get out of the seat and give somebody else a chance to see what they can do with it and i think theres a lot of things the growth opportunities in this company now that weve set it up with so many planks that are solid you have an abundance of choices and i just look at what weve done with mufg in japan the socalled that ted has been driving with hiro the ceo of mufg of taking our japanese business with them to a completely different level and i think theres a lot of things we can do with them in japan strategically taking advantage of the turnaround of the japanese economy thats just one example so yes were getting close im certainly not a barrier to it im an i dont know if the words enabler but id like to get on with it and ill help in the transition as executive chairman for a bit and this place will go forth and thrive operator well go next to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning i guess just wanted to followup on something you said james around the optimal level of rates and you talked about nii but if the fed were to hike a few more times or if rates stay at these levels for longer is there an argument to be made that just structurally the business will be challenged until we get to the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 other side of the rate cycle given just client assets probably remain in lower spread products just talk to us in terms of how you think about if rates dont get cut is that a headwind to the business until we get to the other side james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley no i definitely dont think theres structural issue i mean my goodness the business is generating im talking about wealth margins with the various costs in there and i think its sharon without them if you tell me few years ago i mean i thought wed get to but pretty much nobody else in the world did so no theres no structural issue here im just saying and i do think if at the risk of making a prediction i suspect the fed will do one more rate increase at some by the end of the year i guess november but thats likely to be it and i do not expect the fed to cut rates in but i do expect going forward after that so given that were talking about months the cash is largely moved thats moved on the margin youre going to have a little bit of nii impact over the next months but thats really not the real game the real game is goforward after that and the minute you see the fed indicate theyve stopped raising rates the ma and underwriting calendar will explode because there is enormous pent up activity the boards of directors are sitting there saying until we understand the cost of financing it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital transactions so i think youre heading into and unfortunately im not going to be around to enjoy it but youre heading into a really good patch here and i dont know if its six months out or nine months out or it starts three months out but this thing is going to start turning and then rates will be the kicker when they start coming down and as i said people will be less focused on cash and accounts and more focused on investment opportunities thats when youre going to see the double kicker ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it i guess a good time for you to hand off your successor will be thanking you for that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i hope so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch but a separate question i think sharon you mentioned about focus on secular growth i think international expansion etrades done now im assuming youre not doing any big ma any time soon just talk to us about international expansion a lot of disruption on wealth management private banking globally what the opportunities are where were investing would love some color around that sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley investing more broadly internationally james mentioned the deals or what weve been working on id say mufg between research and also our sales and trading side we continue to look for opportunities we have arun kohli whos been has been working on our india franchise i think that there are clearly opportunities there within india we see a lot of opportunities throughout asia weve discussed different opportunities also all across the international franchise in europe so when you think about investment management that was one of the key points that we had talked about potential distribution of investment management eaton vance products all over morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 europe weve seen that we continue to see products with calvert with various active etfs that were seeing all across europe again and weve been raising new aum there so there are ways to distribute product across different geographies theres a way to work with our strategic partners in places like japan therere ways to organically take advantage and move forward in places of growth that have more secular growth trends such as india so there are tremendous opportunities where we see that we can take like i said product client relationship and also work across institutional securities and various places in investment management dan simkowitz has talked a lot about that raising funds through those partnerships and being able to look for ways to work together to also source talent internationally as we work across the organization james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and id just add i mean i was in the middle east a few months ago were opening an office in abu dhabi if you think of the combination of middle east india japan kind of offsetting whats gone on in china and then strategically i would be very surprised if this firm doesnt do some transactions in both wealth and asset management over the next three years outside the us i think we have a game plan for it strategically the team has worked on a lot of ideas and obviously we want to make sure when we do it were fully ready and we understand all of the diligence issues around some of these relationships and were careful about that but i think the opportunities are clearly there operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to followup on flows obviously feebased flows strong in the quarter but the total flow number came in and i understand the environment was a bit softer here in the third quarter but could you maybe talk about the channels where the pullback was seen the most you didnt mention workplace so im not sure would love some color there as well sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah thanks dan for the question we have talked about the fact that within the workplace channel i think both in the first and second quarter ive been asked about it and it is people are using some of that cash we arent necessarily seeing that movement directly into peoples accounts and theyre taking the stock that they might get and actually selling it rather than investing in it given whats going on with the economic environment potentially inflation et cetera so thats potentially a theme out there but obviously thats dependent on the market what is more exciting in my mind is actually where we did see the increase in nna which was on new clients and recruiting so those were the two strongest components and the ability to attract new clients i said it before on these calls if you asked me five years ago well before we bought etrade and when we were just looking at the beginning of the modern wealth platform many people asked how will you ever grow because we werent seeing new clients coming into the institution the investments that weve made across the technology for wealth management has been whats been able to attract new recruits so if you talk to recruits about why they come to morgan stanley its the products they can offer its the technology that we have its the ability to work with the client so youre seeing that continue and then youre also seeing new client acquisition through the funnel so those are all positive metrics and again you see that in the stock plan participants rising as well morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and then just a followup on investment banking and understanding the environment isnt ideal but you did talk about increase in announcements so i was hoping you could provide some context maybe on the sponsor community and maybe how those conversations are happening and just overall backlog levels versus kind of last quarter sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah the backlog itself continued to rise and to build overall over the course of the year weve talked a lot about sort of being at some of the highest levels that weve seen across all be it underwriting or on the advisory side so all of that is optimistic financial sponsors we have talked about dry powder continue to see that obviously there was some valuation gaps and as james said the more clarity that we see around stabilization of rates the easier that will be around deployment and then some key themes that we have witnessed when we look at the backlog or we think about the transactions that are happening one is the financial sector consolidation thats a theme thats emerging within our pipeline and our discussions in the boardroom the second is the energy transitions again that is important to some of the transactions that we have worked on and that weve talked through and in addition to that we are seeing emerging themes around technology around ai around how companies want to use that when theyre thinking about strategic focus and objectives and all of these themes are part and parcel to the fact that you can see its a diversified backlog and were investing in the franchise weve made some key hires to help us navigate through this more complex landscape and places where we see opportunities to execute as we move forward operator well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james good morning sharon james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start with a question on just the expense and margin outlook expenses were actually well managed in the quarter but one of your peers did talk about competition intensifying in terms of the war for talent within investment banking and trading it feels like thats been the case for the better part of a number of years in wealth management i was hoping you could just speak to your expense growth outlook and your confidence in terms of your ability to achieve the firmwide margin target of morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so when you think about the expenses we have been looking at expenses through the cycle unfortunately we have taken action we took actions both at the end of last year and then we took one in the spring as well weve discussed those severance costs throughout the course of the year and so weve been managing our expenses to better understand and to sort of think about it against the backdrop of what environment are we seeing so while theres always a war for talent we do pay for talent and we pay competitively for that talent but we have to think about it in the context of where we see the potential growth opportunities and that is also we have to take into account the investments that were making and thats around processes and investing in technology and when you look at the technology that were investing in we should see operating efficiencies and leverage as you go forward so thats modernization of the plant youre going to have optimization and youre also going to work on things like making sure that you have the right risk and control framework to give ourselves an opportunity to grow so just what it means to boil it down is its a balance of investing for the future but also making sure that you have the right expense base rather as you move forward and you can take advantage and see those efficiency gains and really the operating leverage that james is talking about as we move forward through the cycle james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just say one thing on the war for talent yeah i mean obviously really high performers are in demand across the street but weve actually had the opposite issue weve had very low attrition which is why we did some of the expense initiatives that sharon talked about and i guess we should feel flattered its a reflection of the culture and the stability of the firm but also thats why we took the initiatives because youve got to bring in talented people and new generations to keep growing this place so onesies and twosies yeah you can lose somebody a senior person here or there weve hired a bunch in banking as sharon said but broader across the people weve got is the broader message is attrition has been remarkably low and thats something that weve just got to work through steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and for my followup just a question on capital james you noted that pro forma basel iii endgame your capital requirements approximate your current capital base how much capital cushion do you plan on running with also how it informs your buyback and you addressed a question on rotce targets curious if that target contemplates higher capital under basel iii so i know theres a lot in there capital cushion buyback level rotce target james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley going to have to write this down for an old guy this is a lot to remember its not going to affect rotce were not going to be increasing capital so that one you can put to bed the cushion its a function of where the rules come out i mean ive been very clear about this day one i do not believe the proposal as is will be what we see when the comment period is over i do not believe that ive no special insight except that obviously ive spent a lot of time with the regulatory community which ive done for years i think everybody understands for example the way operating risk rwas have been calculated in a sort of blunt instrument based on fees is not it wasnt what basel was originally going to do they were going to take morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 that rule out years ago and they ended up just not getting around to it and suddenly were complying with something that they didnt even want and they dont use in europe so its just not going to happen the way it is and thats not being pollyannish thats just my judgment call that said what we want to frame with investors is god forbid it does happen exactly as is the rule becomes proposal rule tomorrow then were fine so were certainly not going to be raising capital were going to continue with our buyback through that period the final implementation of this thing is going to be theres a lot thats going to happen between now and then but listen this is the first time youve had members of the fed board and fdic i think come out in advance of a rule being promulgated if thats the word saying that theyre not comfortable with it so theres clearly debate within the regulatory institutions and if you get past the why we need more capital which i dont think the industry does into well what should it be the only place it clearly shouldnt be is punishing businesses that have fees attached to them whether its credit cards or wealth management thats not the regulatory intent and theyve told me that and therefore i believe that will change so on the cushion its frankly a function of where the rule ends up well carry whatever appropriate prudent cushion we need to carry do we create more capital no not unless we grow the business to reflect that that we can put it to work and thirdly will we continue buybacks yes and im sure sharon can give more flavor on what we think about on the buyback side and dividends for that matter sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah on the capital return strategy weve been really clear that we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders dan said that at the september conference even when you think about our basel first and foremost we talked about the dividend strategy we doubled our dividend a few years ago and weve continually increased the dividend that increase has been reflective of the growth and stable revenues that weve had more broadly as an institution then of course buyback committed to a buyback but the size of a buyback is always going to be opportunistic when you think about what the alternatives are for capital usage right so what are the opportunities that we see going forward and well make the right decision for what we think the right decision is for the company and for our shareholders around the uses of the capital but we increased the buyback this quarter so that shows you sort of how we feel about being able to return capital to our shareholders when you compare this quarter over the course of last quarter moving from billion to billion operator well go next to devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks good morning i guess first question just on the etrade conversion im sure good to get on the other side of that and you spoke to some of the benefits i think more on the flow side and revenue side just curious if theres any kind of more material expense saving opportunities just assuming theres probably some redundancies there that can be removed and then any other efficiencies that might exist sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley look we havent really this deal was never contemplated from a cost synergy perspective its really been around revenue synergies will there be potential savings on the margin its possible but thats not really the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 point of the transaction what i think is more fundamentally interesting is a couple of things when you think about the etrade integration other than the fact that it went very smoothly as it relates to the clients themselves it creates a really clear foundation when were trying to migrate clients from channels and move them so give somebody from an etrade channel or selfdirected channel and say lets make an introduction to a nfa and begin that potential migration if youre on the same platform its a much easier and much more seamless transition so thats a positive use of that thats an example of how being on the same platform is helpful the same goes for workplace right everything flows into the same places again that should be helpful as we move forward its also very helpful from a bank rails perspective so as we think about banking products as you can use remember etrade had bank rails on their platform again a lot of that can be used as we are now looking to potentially grow portions of the bank or grow lending or grow deposits those are all things that now that the platforms are put together on a consolidated basis so i would look at it more from a revenue synergy perspective than necessarily a cost synergy perspective devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific thanks sharon quick followup here just on net interest income trajectory in gwm so we can make some assumptions around the trajectory of deposits but how should we be thinking about the asset yield trajectory from here if we use the forward curve i guess what are some of the puts and takes to be thinking about there sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yes again so i would look at the movements if youre trying to draw relationship between sweeps and nii really over the last two quarters the asset yields are going to be a function of what the market yields are last quarter for example i mentioned that we had the nii was supported by higher asset yields youll remember that when we walked out of the first quarter we were in a position where there was still a regional banking crisis some of the yields were higher as you think about funding yields simply because what was going on in the environment as those yields normalized that came down you lost some of that asset yield and you began to see what we the deposits themselves had a bigger more prominent reaction when you look at a sequential change in nii so what i would try and do is you should take both quarters for example into consideration when youre thinking about the relationship between sweeps and nii and of course asset yields will be determined by market factors more broadly operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning james and sharon thanks for taking my questions would like to start similar to that last question so theres clearly uncertainty but also it seems equally clear that nii is no longer a tailwind for wealth so when youre thinking about the pretax margin target that youve provided for that business what are your plans given that tailwind may be turning into a headwind or at least moderating and how are you calibrating any planned investment and balance that out with the potential for growth on the back of that sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 thanks for the question brennan as you would expect its a balance right weve made changes to our expense base over the course of this year but we want to make sure that were investing for longterm growth by being able to offer both technology platform solutions et cetera so that our advisors the most important thing about the investment is to create opportunities where the advisors have more time the more time that the advisors have the more theyre able to prospect new business and bring new assets to the top of the funnel so thats how were prioritizing the investments in order to get the operating leverage as the market begins to turn brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay is that lever large enough are you going to be able to or willing to back investments in order to support moving towards that pretax margin even without nii tailwinds sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley we would see ourselves in a were not we have put out those targets and its not that theres a shot clock in terms of the timing of those targets brennan the goal is to create a business model that has the opportunity to do that on a more sustained basis and the way that one is to do that from an assetled strategy is to grow the asset management revenue streams and the transactional streams and thats what youre seeing over the course of this quarter alone youre able to grow assets youre able to deploy those assets into different transactional products which helps the transactional line and eventually it also moves into the advicebased relationship products which has a higher annuity stream as well and so thats the strategy and youre seeing it play out as we move forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah id just point out brennan i mean on billion of revenue the deficit against the longterm target is currently about million million so were talking less than were already at ex the integration costs they could take of the costs out of that business tomorrow and hit that number so this is not back in the day when we were talking about margin and we were at that was when certain people were skeptical about that were in a whole different league now can go to we can make that happen what we want to make sure is we make happen the growth over the next several years so this is not a heavy lift so im not worried about that at all brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you for that if you could sharon maybe just one more clarification could you talk about the asset side and looking at market yields whats the duration that we should be thinking about if were trying to calibrate because the disclosure on the asset side for wealth is not as robust we have to kind of use a couple creative metrics within the filings sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley in general when youre talking about the afs portfolio the duration of the afs portfolio is under two but what you have to think about is just the deposits themselves and whats going on with right now when we look at it were slightly still asset sensitive but of course if rates rise the deposit duration also shortens so i just think you have to think about youre taking all things into consideration as you move forward given the cycle morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley were going to try and get in the last three questions quickly here so we might run minutes over operator well go next to jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just pivoting to the trading business ficc trading up sequentially a bit unusual in a seasonally slow third quarter so maybe just talk a little about the drivers how sustainable you think they are at least in the nearterm and maybe overall thoughts on industry wallet into next year sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah its a great question when you look at whats gone on in terms of the industry wallet we talked a lot about and being book ends obviously you are above the wallet more broadly and you see this playing out because things like fixed income you do have more central bank action and you do you have more broadly associated vol when you think about precovid levels so all that is fundamentally positive in terms of specifically the trading businesses you had movements like i said in commodities oil that ability to capture vol its really around being there for our clients but having greater velocity of sheet and the more that were able to do that as we move forward we restructured this business tremendously over the course of the last eight years nine years and its being there to be able to serve our clients and using our resources to some degree more effectively and efficiently jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thats it from me thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thanks jim operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi one kind of positive question one negative question maybe james when you think of the permanent improvement from levels prepandemic how much higher do you think global wallet share should be for both investment banking and trading like as you look out over three to five years was the normal or should it be above that because global wallet share is drifting back towards although the big us banks are staying above that and then the negative question is just nii is down quarteroverquarter in wealth and what are you guiding for that to be down and when do you think that inflects thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 sure i think the global wallet will trend higher than i think right now were obviously at an extreme low on the banking side and trading is kind of muted fixed income yeah we had a sequential nice run equity is at and nowhere near top levels i dont see any of the global competitors challenging the sort of top of the us three the top three or four firms and i think whats going on as i said earlier with the middle east and india japan parts of latam youre going to see nonus growth over the next several years so yeah i feel actually really pretty good about the outlook and ill let sharon i think weve touched on a lot of the nii stuff and obviously you cant model this stuff you dont know exactly how people will behave because its a function of how they feel about where rates are and other opportunities at any point in time but sharon sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah were not giving guidance right here but what we did say is that the next quarter we have said will be lower and thats a function mathematically of the exit rates of deposits where we entered the quarter but what is encouraging is that as we ended september and then we looked into october our client behavior is in line with our modeled expectation operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning sharon good morning james ill just ask a single question in view of the time can you guys give us a view of the outlook for your mergers and acquisitions your appetite obviously james over your tenure you guys have done a number of successful acquisitions and as you look out over the next three years to five years i know james you wont be here but whats the appetite is it still something opportunistic if something comes up it seems like you have all of your products lined up by channel but can you get economies of scale by buying some competitors in different channels thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley definitely the latter its not just opportunistic its strategic in that we have a game plan we just completed an off site a month ago with the whole operating committee and each of the leaders that you know all about ted andy and dan were heavily engaged in that from the business side i think there are a lot of interesting properties in this world and weve got a machine jim hennessy ill give a callout to him he led the integration of etrade he actually led the integration going all the way back to smith barney hundreds of people that worked on that so weve got an integration machine you start with you have a vision of what the company should look like and then do you have a set of strategic options which if available you would hit the bid then the opportunistic is when they become available like eaton vance did you hit the bid but the real issue is can you integrate them safely and securely and then finally having done that will that drive growth above the current run rate so thats how we think about acquisitions the team is very weighted behind it i dont know sharon if you want to add anything to that but yeah this firm will do sensible not reckless not lifechanging but sensible deals as weve done weve done many of them mesa west solium and theres a lot of opportunity out there gerard i think thats a wrap operator therere no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference
