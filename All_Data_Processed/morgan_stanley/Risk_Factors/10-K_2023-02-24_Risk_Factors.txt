by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors our results of operations have been in the past and may in the future be materially affected by global financial market and economic conditions both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels these include the level and volatility of equity fixed income and commodity prices the level and term structure of interest rates inflation and currency values the level of other market indices fiscal or monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators and uncertainty concerning government shutdowns debt ceilings or funding which may be driven by economic conditions market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics natural disasters climaterelated incidents acts of war or aggression geopolitical instability changes to global trade policies and the implementation of tariffs or protectionist trade policies and other factors or a combination of these or other factors for example in the global economic and geopolitical environment was characterized by persistent inflation rising interest rates volatility in global financial markets leading to among other things a decline in equity prices supply chain complications recessionary fears and geopolitical uncertainty regarding the war between russia and ukraine and its impact on the global markets including the energy markets the results of our institutional securities business segment particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty these fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other financial products fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity which among other things can be impacted by market uncertainty or lack of investor and client confidence due to unforeseen economic geopolitical or market conditions that in turn affect the size number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets andor the level of and mix of client assets which would negatively impact the results of our wealth management business segment substantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in the value of our investments in our funds the flow of investment capital into or from aum and the way customers allocate capital among money market equity fixed income or other investment alternatives which could negatively impact the results of our investment management business segment the value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets may make it difficult to value and monetize certain of our financial instruments particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement subsequent valuations in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performancebased income also known as incentive fees which include carried interest in respect of certain businesses in addition at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods in addition financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity under these extreme conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions moreover under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our marketmaking investing underwriting including table start december form 10k table end table start table end block trading and lending businesses including margin lending in the event of unfavorable market movements we commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of or making large loans to a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry country or region in the event we hold a concentrated position larger than those held by competitors we may incur larger losses for further information regarding our country risk exposure see also quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskcountry and other risks credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us for more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskcredit risk we are exposed to the risk that thirdparties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations we incur significant credit risk exposure through our institutional securities business segment this risk may arise from a variety of business activities including but not limited to extending credit to clients through various lending commitments entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us providing short or longterm funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount posting margin andor collateral and other commitments to clearing houses clearing agencies exchanges banks securities firms and other financial counterparties and investing and trading in securities and loan pools whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans we also incur credit risk in our wealth management business segment lending to mainly individual investors including but not limited to margin and securitiesbased loans collateralized by securities and residential mortgage loans including helocs our valuations related to and reserves for losses on credit exposures rely on complex models estimates and subjective judgments about the future while we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk future economic conditions including inflation and changes in real estate values that differ from or are more severe than forecast inaccurate models or assumptions or external factors such as global pandemics natural disasters or geopolitical events could lead to inaccurate measurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result in unexpected losses we may also incur higher than anticipated credit losses as a result of i disputes with counterparties over the valuation of collateral or ii actions taken by other lenders that may negatively impact the valuation of collateral in cases where we foreclose on collateral sudden declines in the value or liquidity of collateral may result in significant losses to us despite our i credit monitoring ii overcollateralization iii ability to call for additional collateral or iv ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation in addition in the longer term climate change may have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients certain of our credit exposures may be concentrated by counterparty product industry or country although our models and estimates account for correlations among related types of exposures a change in the market environment for a concentrated product or an external factor impacting a concentrated counterparty industry or country may result in credit losses in excess of amounts forecast in addition as a clearing member of several central counterparties we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers and could incur financial losses in the event of default by other clearing members although we regularly review our credit exposures default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee a default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets the commercial soundness of many financial institutions and certain other large financial services firms may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships among such entities increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearing houses central agents or exchanges may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one or more such entities could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing houses clearing agencies exchanges banks and securities firms with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us see also systemic risk regime under businesssupervision

factors or from external events eg cyberattacks or thirdparty vulnerabilities that may manifest as for example loss of information business disruption theft and fraud legal and compliance risks or damage to physical assets we may incur operational risk across the full scope of table start december form 10k table end table start table end our business activities including revenuegenerating activities and support and control groups eg information technology and trade processing legal regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under legal regulatory and compliance risk for more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskoperational risk we are subject to operational risks including a failure breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our thirdparties or thirdparties thereof as well as human error or malfeasance which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report on a daily basis a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies we may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting including in connection with new regulatory requirements or integration of processes or systems of acquired companies resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify the trend toward direct access to automated electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades we rely on the ability of our employees our consultants our internal systems and systems at technology centers maintained by unaffiliated thirdparties to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions unusually high trading volumes or site usage could cause our systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail disruptions to destruction of instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our information technology systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services including our selfdirected brokerage platform could harm our business and our reputation as a major participant in the global capital markets we face the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data models electronic trading systems or processes or due to fraud or cyberattack we also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending securities and derivatives transactions in addition in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our or a direct or indirect thirdpartys systems or thirdparties thereof processes or information assets or improper or unauthorized action by thirdparties including consultants and subcontractors or our employees we have in the past and may receive regulatory sanctions and could suffer financial loss an impairment to our liquidity position a disruption of our businesses or damage to our reputation in addition the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents exchanges and clearing houses and the increased importance of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business furthermore the concentration of firm and personal information held by a handful of thirdparties increases the risk that a breach at a key thirdparty may cause an industrywide event that could significantly increase the cost and risk of conducting business there can be no assurance that our business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption involving physical site access software flaws and vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents terrorist activities political unrest disease pandemics catastrophic events climaterelated incidents and natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and wildfires electrical outages environmental hazards computer servers communication platforms or other services we use and our employees or thirdparties with whom we conduct business although we employ backup systems for our data those backup systems may be unavailable following a disruption the affected data may not have been backed up or may not be recoverable from the backup or the backup data may be costly to recover which could adversely affect our business notwithstanding evolving technology and technologybased risk and control systems our businesses ultimately rely on people including our employees and those of thirdparties with which we conduct business as a result of human error or engagement in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures certain errors or violations are not always discovered immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations these can include calculation or input errors inadvertent or duplicate payments mistakes in addressing emails or other communications errors in software or model development or implementation or errors in judgment as well as intentional efforts to disregard or circumvent applicable policies laws rules or procedures human errors and malfeasance even if promptly discovered and remediated can result in material losses and liabilities for us we conduct business in various jurisdictions outside the us including jurisdictions that may not have comparable levels of protection for their corporate assets such as intellectual property trademarks trade secrets knowhow and customer information and records the protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less established andor predictable than in the us or other jurisdictions in which we operate as a result there may also be heightened risks associated with the potential theft of their data technology and intellectual property in those jurisdictions by domestic or foreign actors table start december form 10k table end table start table end including private parties and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors additionally we are subject to complex and evolving us and international laws and regulations governing cybersecurity privacy and data governance transfer and protection which may differ and potentially conflict in various jurisdictions any theft of data technology or intellectual property may negatively impact our operations and reputation including disrupting the business activities of our subsidiaries affiliates joint ventures or clients conducting business in those jurisdictions a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or a thirdparty could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk or result in disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet mobile telecommunications and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external extremist parties including foreign state actors in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends global events and geopolitical instability including the war between russia and ukraine may lead to increased nation state targeting of financial institutions in the us and abroad any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers clients vendors or other thirdparties or users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our employees or clients information security risks may also derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of our employees or thirdparties or may result from accidental technological failure for example human error has led to the loss of the firms physical databearing devices in the past these risks may be heightened by several factors including remote work or as a result of the integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives that may subject us to new technology customers or thirdparty providers in addition thirdparties with whom we do business or share information our regulators and each of their service providers as well as the thirdparties with whom our customers and clients share information used for authentication may also be sources of cybersecurity and information security risks particularly where activities of customers are beyond our security and control systems there is no guarantee that the measures we take will provide absolute security or recoverability given that the techniques used in cyberattacks are complex and frequently change and are difficult to anticipate like other financial services firms the firm its thirdparty providers and its clients continue to be the subject of unauthorized access attacks mishandling or misuse of information computer viruses or malware cyberattacks designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage ransomware denial of service attacks data breaches social engineering attacks and other events there can be no assurance that such unauthorized access mishandling or misuse of information or cyber incidents will not occur in the future and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale we maintain a significant amount of personal and confidential information on our customers clients and certain counterparties that we are required to protect under various state federal and international data protection and privacy laws these laws may be in conflict with one another or courts and regulators may interpret them in ways that we had not anticipated or that adversely affect our business a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a thirdparty could jeopardize our or our clients employees partners vendors or counterparties personal confidential proprietary or other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our and our thirdparties computer systems furthermore such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our clients employees partners vendors counterparties or thirdparties operations as well as the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of other thirdparties any of these events could result in reputational damage with our clients and the market client dissatisfaction additional costs to us to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure violation of the applicable data protection and privacy laws regulatory investigations and enforcement actions litigation exposure or fines or penalties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process the large number of clients partners vendors and counterparties with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks a cyberattack information or security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection it could take considerable time for us to determine the scope extent amount and type of information compromised and the impact of such an attack may not be fully understood during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack or data breach while many of our agreements with partners and thirdparty vendors include indemnification provisions we may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under such provisions to adequately offset any losses we may incur in addition although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber table start december form 10k table end table start table end and information security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses we may incur we continue to make investments with a view toward maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security posture the cost of managing cyber and information security risks and attacks along with complying with new increasingly expansive and evolving regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and business liquidity risk liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets liquidity risk also encompasses our ability or perceived ability to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern as well as the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding for more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity risk see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskliquidity risk liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations liquidity is essential to our businesses our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the longterm or shortterm debt capital markets our inability to access the secured lending markets our inability to attract and retain deposits or unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral by customers or clients factors that we cannot control such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the us and other geographic areas could impair our ability to raise funding in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading losses a downgrade by the rating agencies a decline in the level of our business activity if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our industry or if we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment portfolios or trading assets to meet maturing liabilities or other obligations we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by among other things our longterm and shortterm credit ratings the rating agencies continue to monitor certain firmspecific and industrywide factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings these include governance capital adequacy the level and quality of earnings liquidity and funding risk appetite and management asset quality strategic direction business mix regulatory or legislative changes macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support and it is possible that the rating agencies could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions our credit ratings also can have an adverse impact on certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is a key consideration such as otc and other derivative transactions including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our institutional securities business segment we may be required to provide additional collateral to or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade termination of our trading and other agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant payments in the form of cash or securities the additional collateral or termination payments that may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and

regulation will impact our business like other major financial services firms we are subject to extensive regulation by us federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business including an increasing number of complex sanctions regimes these laws and regulations which continue to increase in volume and complexity significantly affect the way and costs of doing business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments the firm and its employees are subject to wideranging regulation and supervision which among other things subject us to intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses through acquisitions or otherwise limitations on new activities a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity and funding requirements and other

transaction reporting obligations and broadened fiduciary obligations ongoing implementation of our efforts to comply with andor changes to laws and regulations including changes in the breadth application interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold expose us to additional theories of liability and additional costs require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors in addition regulatory requirements that are imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the us and may adversely affect us legal and regulatory requirements continue to be subject to ongoing interpretation and change which may result in significant new costs to comply with new or revised requirements as well as to monitor for compliance on an ongoing basis the application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the us or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders and subject us to other restrictions we are required to submit once every two years to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution and if table start december form 10k table end table start table end we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiencies identified by the regulators we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations or after a twoyear period we may be required to divest assets or operations in addition provided that certain procedures are met we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the doddfrank act with the fdic being appointed as receiver instead of being resolved under the us bankruptcy code the fdics power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances subject to certain limitations could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt see businesssupervision and regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcesregulatory requirements further because both our resolution plan contemplates an spoe strategy under the us bankruptcy code and the fdic has proposed an spoe strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers we believe that the application of an spoe strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority an spoe strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy and the parent company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with such entities pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities in addition a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the parent company morgan stanley holdings llc funding ihc serves as a resolution funding vehicle the parent company has transferred and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis certain assets to the funding ihc in the event of a resolution scenario the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support agreement other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets to the funding ihc the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity as applicable to certain supported subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the secured amended and restated support agreement the obligations of the parent company and of the funding ihc respectively under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets and the assets of the funding ihc as applicable as a result claims of certain supported subsidiaries including the funding ihc against the assets of the parent company with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company although an spoe strategy whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall there is no guarantee that the application of an spoe strategy including the provision of support to the parent companys supported subsidiaries pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared with a different resolution strategy for us regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an spoe strategy under the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes for example the federal reserve requires toptier bhcs of us gsibs including the firm to maintain adequate tlac including equity and eligible longterm debt in order to ensure that such institutions have enough lossabsorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible tlac where the spoe strategy is used the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the tlac requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible longterm debt and other forms of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support in addition certain jurisdictions including the uk and eu jurisdictions have implemented or are in the process of implementing changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity such bailin powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors this may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities including in times of stress nonus regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of tlac that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the parent company and ultimately to security holders of the parent company in the event of failure we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve including with respect to regulatory capital requirements stress testing and capital planning we submit on at least an annual basis a capital plan to the federal reserve describing proposed table start december form 10k table end table start table end dividend payments to shareholders proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take our ability to take capital actions described in the capital plan is dependent on among other factors the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital actions for additional information see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources herein the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability as a global financial services firm we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition to the monetary consequences these measures could cause collateral consequences for example such matters could impact our ability to engage in or impose limitations on certain of our businesses these investigations and proceedings as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought continue to impact the financial services industry and certain us and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against or have sought criminal convictions pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from financial institutions significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm which could seriously harm our business the doddfrank act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the sec or cftc with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action as a result of this compensation it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the sec or cftc we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages claims for indeterminate amounts of damages or may result in material penalties fines or other results adverse to us in some cases the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress in other cases including antitrust litigation we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions like any large corporation we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct including noncompliance with policies laws rules and regulations and improper use or disclosure of confidential information or improper sales practices or other conduct we may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with commercial and residential real estate loans and may incur losses in excess of our reserves we originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties further we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estaterelated assets and products in connection with these activities we have provided or otherwise agreed to be responsible for certain representations and warranties under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached and may incur losses as a result we have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain loans that we securitized in cmbs and rmbs for additional information see note to the financial statements a failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation as a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients including corporations governments financial institutions and individuals we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business for example potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client among clients between an employee on the one hand and us or a client on the other or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client moreover we utilize multiple brands and business channels including those resulting from our acquisitions and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segments which may heighten the potential conflicts of interest or the risk of improper sharing of information we have policies procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest and we utilize various measures such as the use of disclosure to manage these potential conflicts however identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny indeed actions that merely appear to table start december form 10k table end table start table end create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated it is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation our regulators also have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest including through detailed examinations of specific transactions for example our status as a bhc supervised by the federal reserve subjects us to direct federal reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our us bank subsidiaries and their affiliates further the volcker rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients risk management our risk management strategies models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk which could result in unexpected losses we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future nonetheless our risk management strategies models and processes including our use of various risk models for assessing market credit liquidity and operational exposures and hedging strategies stress testing and other analysis may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated as our businesses change and grow including through acquisitions and the markets in which we operate evolve our risk management strategies models and processes may not always adapt with those changes some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and managements judgment as a result these methods may not predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and therefore cannot anticipate sudden unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements such as the impact of a pandemic or a sudden geopolitical conflict which could cause us to incur losses management of market credit liquidity operational model legal regulatory and compliance risks requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes for example to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions we may therefore incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies models and processes see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskmarket risk climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could result in increased costs and risks and adversely affect our operations businesses and clients there continues to be increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climaterelated events such as floods hurricanes heatwaves wildfires and chronic longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as higher global average temperatures rising sea levels and droughts such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients or thirdparties on which we rely including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility over the longer term these events could impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to repay their obligations reduce the value of collateral limit insurance coverage and result in other effects additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy will likely require extensive policy legal technology and market changes transition risks including changes in consumer and business sentiment related technologies shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements including carbon taxes could increase our expenses and adversely impact our strategies including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain products and services over the longer term negative impacts to certain of our clients such as decreased profitability and stranded assets could also lead to increased credit and counterparty risk to us in addition our reputation and client relationships may be adversely impacted as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our clients involvement in certain industries projects or initiatives associated with causing or potentially slowing solutions to climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change legislative or table start december form 10k table end table start table end regulatory uncertainties and change regarding climaterelated risks including inconsistent perspectives or requirements are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs our ability to achieve our longterm climaterelated goals and commitments could also result in reputational harm as a result of public sentiment regulatory scrutiny litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence if we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our current response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient our business and reputation may suffer the risks associated with and the perspective of regulators governments shareholders employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate changerelated risks and uncertainties as climate risk is interconnected with other risk types including geopolitical risks we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies for risks such as market credit and operational risks as well as our governance structures despite our risk management strategies the unpredictability surrounding the timing and severity of climate change events and societal or political changes in reaction to them make it difficult to predict identify monitor and effectively mitigate climate risk exposure in addition the methodologies and data used to manage and monitor climate risk are still in early stages and continue to evolve current approaches utilize information and estimates that have been derived from information or factors released by thirdparty sources which may not reflect the latest or most accurate data climaterelated data particularly greenhouse gas emissions for clients and counterparties remains limited in availability and variable in quality certain thirdparty information may also change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined while we believe this information is the best available at the time we may only be able to complete limited validation furthermore modeling capabilities and methodologies to analyze climaterelated risks although improving remain nascent and emerging these and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by thirdparties and by us which could also impact our management of risk in this area replacement of london interbank offered rate and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations central banks around the world including the federal reserve have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace libor and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks collectively the ibors a transition away from use of the ibors to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and is a multiyear initiative these reforms have caused and may in the future cause such rates to perform differently than in the past or to cease entirely or have other consequences that are contrary to market expectations the ongoing market transition away from ibors and other interest rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular such transition or reform could adversely impact the pricing liquidity value of return on and trading for

iborbased products such as fallback language or other related provisions including in the case of fallbacks to the alternative reference rates any economic legal operational or other impact resulting from the fundamental differences between the ibors and the various alternative reference rates require the additional transition andor further development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from ibors to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner including by quantifying value and risk for various alternative reference rates which may prove challenging given the limited history of the proposed alternative reference rates and cause us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors other factors include the pace of the transition to the alternative reference rates timing mismatches between cash and derivative markets the specific terms and parameters for and market

ancillary services in the us and globally including through the internet we also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services investment advisor services roboadvice capabilities access to digital asset capabilities and services and other financial products and services we compete on the basis of several factors including transaction execution capital or access to capital products and services innovation technology reputation risk appetite and price over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity or new competitors may emerge we have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices eliminating commissions or other fees or providing more favorable terms of business in addition certain of our competitors may be subject to different and in some cases less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than we are thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage some new competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to target existing segments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disruption by innovative or less

automated trading platforms we have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance our people are our most important asset we compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel if we are unable to continue to attract integrate and retain highly qualified employees or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive or the competitive market for talent further intensifies our performance including our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of
