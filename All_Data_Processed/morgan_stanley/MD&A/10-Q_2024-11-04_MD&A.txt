also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap along with a reconciliation of the differences between the us gaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure we present certain nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of marktomarket gains and losses net of financing costs on dcp investments from net revenues we also exclude the impact of marktomarket gains and losses on dcp from compensation expenses the impact of dcp investments and dcp are primarily reflected in our wealth management business segment results these measures allow for better comparability of periodtoperiod underlying operating performance and revenue trends by excluding the impact of these items we are

these dcp awards changes in the fair value of such investments net of financing costs are recorded in net revenues and included in transactional revenues in the wealth management business segment although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period while this timing difference may not be material to our income before provision for income taxes in any individual period it may impact the wealth management business segment reported
