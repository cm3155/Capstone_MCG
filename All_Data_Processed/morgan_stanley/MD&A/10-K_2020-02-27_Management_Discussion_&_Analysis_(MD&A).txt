clawback forfeiture and cancellation provisions additionally there are certain other deferred cashbased programs that allow employees to defer the receipt of current compensation to a future date employees are permitted to allocate the notional value of their deferred awards among a menu of investments whereby the notional value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced investments the menu of investments which is selected by the firm includes fixed income equity commodity and money market funds table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end compensation expense for deferred cashbased compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select compensation expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period for each separate vesting portion of deferred awards correspondingly the firm invests directly as a principal in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge its obligations under these deferred cashbased compensation plans changes in the value of such investments made by the firm are recorded in trading and investments revenues although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firms investments

accounting development updates the financial accounting standards board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements the following accounting update was adopted on january table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end table start financial instrumentscredit losses this accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a cecl methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset recorded at inception or purchase cecl replaces the loss model currently applicable to loans held for investment htm securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost such as employee loans table end the update also eliminates the concept of otherthantemporary impairment for afs securities and instead requires impairments on afs securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost for certain portfolios we have determined that there are no expected credit losses for example based on collateral arrangements for lending and financing transactions such as securities borrowed securities purchased under agreements to resell and certain other portfolios also we have a zero loss expectation for certain financial assets based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer such as us government and agency securities at transition on january the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of million net of tax the increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily attributable to employee loans commercial real estate loans and securities and residential real estate loans partially offset by a decrease primarily in secured lending facilities within corporate loans prior period amounts will not be restated critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions see note to the financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value we use various valuation approaches a hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels wherein level represents quoted prices in active markets level represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable and level consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment in periods of market disruption the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level to level or from level to level in addition a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments for further information on the definition of fair value level level level and related valuation techniques and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements see notes and to the financial statements where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk bidask adjustments credit quality model uncertainty concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value for a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply see note to the financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit as such all the activities table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end of a reporting unit whether acquired or organically developed are available to support the value of the goodwill for both the annual and interim tests we have the option to either i perform a quantitative impairment test or ii first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in which case the quantitative test would be performed when performing a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate pricetobook and pricetoearnings multiples of certain comparable companies at each annual goodwill impairment testing date each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value intangible assets amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows for both goodwill and intangible assets to the extent an impairment loss is recognized the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted for amortizable intangible assets the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods see notes and to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets legal and regulatory contingencies in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business and involving among other matters sales and trading activities wealth and investment management services financial products or offerings sponsored underwritten or sold by us and accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a casebycase basis where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income in many proceedings however it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss for certain legal proceedings and investigations we can estimate possible losses additional losses ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued for certain other legal proceedings and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate such losses particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages restitution disgorgement or penalties numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in

end income taxes we are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance once established unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and in some cases are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods we perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for benefit from income taxes current and deferred tax balances including valuation allowance if any accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax

liquidity framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all

capital borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities lending deposits letters of credit and lines of credit we have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies secured financing the liquid nature of the marketable securities and shortterm receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the institutional securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted accordingly we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded we have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption we define highly liquid assets as governmentissued or governmentguaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria to further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets furthermore we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets or our ability to access them become limited as a component of the liquidity risk management framework we hold a portion of our glr against the potential disruption to our secured
