call 23jul2020 stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks mark and thank you to everyone for joining the call today were pleased with our second quarter results which reflect solid execution across the bank despite an incredibly dynamic and challenging operating environment revenue was essentially in level with the yearago quarter as record mortgage income offset pandemicrelated headwinds the actions weve taken to reduce our deposit costs along with the hedging strategy we implemented in are helping to offset the impact from lower rates expenses were down year overyear as a result of the proactive expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of as well as the new program we are implementing in our business model balance between commercial and consumer provides diversification of revenue of course this performance is offsetting challenges our increased ppnr yearoveryear reflects consistent execution of our strategies our purpose of looking out for people has guided our actions during these different times im extremely proud of my colleagues and their continued efforts to mitigate with and support our customers as well as each other over the past month the bank funded more than loans with a total volume of more than billion through the sbas paycheck protection program or ppp to aid small and mediumsized businesses across our footprint huntington is well positioned with robust capital and liquidity to remain supportive of our customers and communities going forward huntington received the highest score in the jd power mobile app satisfaction study for regional banks and this is the second year in a row weve been recognized by jd power providing evidence that our focused technology investments are being well received by our customers as we assess the outlook for the economy we are guardedly optimistic for a gradual economic recovery the unprecedented level of government stimulus has supported both individuals and many companies that support has brought financial stability in the markets recent economic headlines generally appear more positive with homebuilder auto rv and marine sales and sentiment exceeding prepandemic levels us consumer retail sales rose in june as businesses have resumed operations in our businesses we saw a record consumer mortgage origination activity in the second quarter our commercial pipelines have improved over the past few weeks and our customers are becoming more optimistic for the future with many manufacturing customers expecting to be back to prepandemic activity levels during the second half of the year our outlook reflects consensus view of economists that the recovery is taking hold but progress will be uneven while we do see signs for optimism we remain vigilant to possible risks and our visibility is generally limited to the next few months the range of potential outcomes on key metrics remains wide we are monitoring economic and consumer data closely and tightly managing our businesses as a result of lower interest rate levels we are taking actions to manage expenses this year which zach will further describe well remain disciplined on expense growth while making further investments in technology and other strategic business initiatives as the economy recovers and as weve discussed previously over the past decade we have fundamentally changed huntingtons enterprise risk management its now a strength of the company as compared to a weakness during the prior cycle the most recent dfast results demonstrate superior credit performance for our fifth consecutive dfast filing our modeled cumulative loan losses in the feds severely adverse scenario remain among the best in the peer group while our stress capital buffer established at the minimum level of our commitment to an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile is illustrated through the dfast results our second quarter credit metrics remain sound as we address the issues in our oil and gas portfolio with our second quarter provision we believe we huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 have the loss exposure in the oil and gas portfolio fully reserved our underlying portfolio metrics continue to reflect our expectation for outperformance through the cycle weve restrained our commercial lending in with the fourth quarter average yearoveryear growth rate of which gives us a more seasoned portfolio of commercial loans at this point in the cycle this morning we announced that the board declared the third quarter cash dividend of per common share unchanged from the prior quarter based on what we know today management expects to maintain the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter subject to the boards normal quarterly approval process and youll hear more about the dividend from zach as well so zach ill ask you now to provide an overview of the financial performance and carry forward zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides the highlights of the second quarter we reported earnings per common share of return on average assets was basis points return on average common equity was and return on average tangible common equity was clearly results were significantly impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added million to the reserve during the quarter now lets turn to slide to review our results in more detail yearoveryear pretax preprovision earnings growth was we believe this is solid performance in light of the challenges of the interest rate environment and the rapid decline in shortterm rates yeartodate total revenue was relatively flat versus the yearago quarter as pressure on spread revenues was nearly offset by growth in fee income specifically record mortgage banking income of million was partially offset by waivers to assist our customers reduced customer activity and the higher levels of consumer deposit account balances that reduced the deposit service charges and cards and payment fee line items total expenses were lower by million or from the yearago quarter this expense discipline reflects the actions we took in the fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate including the reduction of positions and the closure of instore branches as well as the actions we have taken to adapt to the current environment balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities finally i would like to note that the normal slides containing comparisons for our net interest income fee income and noninterest expense can be found in the appendix turning to slide net interest margin was for the quarter down basis points linked quarter in line with the guidance we provided at the mortgage stanley conference in june the second quarter nim was negatively impacted by a few unusual items that i would like to highlight elevated deposits held at the fed during the quarter reduced nim by basis points versus the first quarter this impact would have been larger but for our active management to move several billion dollars of nonprimary bank relationship account balances off the sheet during the quarter reduced loan late fees primarily in our auto portfolio compressed nim by basis points additionally in  nim was negatively impacted by a 3basispoint derivative ineffectiveness mark while in  the mark was positive basis points thus basis points of the basis points of quartertoquarter nim compression was driven by this item our underlying nim performed quite well despite the challenging interest rate environment given our strong liquidity position we continue to actively manage down our cost of funds our average cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points in the month of june and we see some continued huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 opportunity for modest further reduction our hedging actions continue to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment in the second quarter we had billion of forward starting asset hedges become active providing nim benefit going forward moving forward to slide average earning assets increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter average commercial and industrial loans increased from the yearago quarter and linked quarter reflecting the addition of billion in average ppp loans as of quarter end the total ppp loan balance was just over billion outside of ppp lending we saw solid growth in healthcare and asset finance in the quarter offsetting this growth auto floorplan line utilization was suppressed due to lack of new inventory from oems and we continued to actively manage the noncore exposure in our oil and gas portfolio down including million of loans sold or under contract to be sold in the second quarter consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting robust originations over the past four quarters also as a result of the elevated deposit levels in the quarter we saw a material increase in interestbearing deposits being held at the fed turning to slide we will review the deposit growth average core deposits increased yearoveryear and versus the first quarter primarily driven by commercial loan growth related to the ppp loans and commercial line draws consumer growth related to government stimulus and reduced account attrition during the quarter we saw dramatic shifts in the retail deposit acquisition trends as consumer and business banking customers adapted to the covid environment we saw utilization of online account opening channels increased quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear we are now seeing traditional branchbased acquisition approaching precovid levels slide highlights the trends in commercial loans total deposits salable mortgage originations and debit card spend which is consistent with what we disclosed at last months morgan stanley conference slide illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios the common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended the quarter at down basis points yearoveryear the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at down basis points from a year ago let me turn it over now to rich to cover credit rich richard a pohle chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks zach before i get into the second quarter credit results i want to turn your attention to slide which illustrates the relative rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for huntington and our peers in the federal reserves severely adverse scenarios of the dfast exercise as steve has mentioned over time this is the only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of and it provides us independent validation of the credit risk management discipline and practices weve been implementing for over a decade now to achieve an aggregate moderate to low risk profile our dfast result puts us at the top of our peer group and weve been a topquartile peer performer in each dfast exercise since our portfolio composition evenly split between consumer and commercial businesses gives us diversification in periods of economic stress and our dfast numbers reflect as much turning now to the credit metrics and results slide provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or acl from year end to the second quarter you can see our acl has more than doubled during this period increasing by just under billion to of loans excluding the ppp loan balances our acl would be huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 as of june the second quarter allowance represents a million reserve build from the first quarter like the first quarter there were multiple data points used to size the provision expense for  the primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was in may moodys baseline forecast this scenario assumes peak unemployment in  to followed by a rebound to by the end of and a slow recovery to by the fourth quarter of gdp recovers from a decline in to end the full year down almost and demonstrates growth in with most occurring in the second half of the year the  acl now includes a reserve against our oil and gas portfolio we believe we have the loss content in this portfolio fully reserved we have bifurcated this portfolio into core and noncore segments with the noncore portion representing just under of oil and gas borrowings our coverage includes a coverage ratio against the noncore portfolio and a reserve against the core portfolio recall that our oil and gas portfolio represents about of total loans slide shows our npas and tdrs and demonstrates the impact of our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of npas we have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio commodity prices continued to range below economical levels for this industry oil and gas npas represent of our overall npas and are also a significant contributor to our  npa build notably over of our oil and gas npas were current pay with respect to principal and interest as on quarter end slide provides additional details around the financial accommodations weve provided to our commercial customers the commercial deferrals are now graduating to amendments and waivers and outside of the hospitality and other travelrelated businesses we do not see a widespread need for additional payment relief our auto dealers and franchise restaurant customers two of our larger deferral users are both exiting those deferral periods in a strong shape and we expect nearly all those deferrals to run their course in  to date request for additional deferral periods have been limited in the other commercial portfolios as well slide shows our consumer deferrals and the early news here is good as well our auto rvmarine and heloc portfolios are performing as we would have expected with modest postdeferral delinquencies our focus on high fico customers here has shielded us somewhat from job losses weve seen the mortgage accommodations are a twostep process as the new forbearance agreement is necessary upon the expiration of the first as a result we have limited visibility into the resolution here slide provides an update to the industries hardest hit by covid19 to date we have thoroughly reviewed these portfolios as well as of our total commercial loan portfolios since april and believe we have the existing risks identified and appropriately managed our hotel exposure is centered on five primary sponsors most of them are longterm relationships including through the last downturn we believe these sponsors have the liquidity and financial flexibility to see their way through the longerterm recovery period we forecast for this industry our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quickservice brands that have maintained driveup operations and our sandwich and pizza customers have been open for takeout service to offset the declines in inhouse seating we believe this book to be in good shape overall but well continue to closely monitor the heightened risk in the single location and other nonfranchise names in the portfolio as a leading sba lender in the country we also get guarantees on over million of the restaurant child care physicians practices and other sectors which provides us additional opportunities for recoveries in the second quarter as part of our active portfolio management process we evaluated the covidrelated impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions as required by regulatory guidance to downgrade those huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 severely impacted credits to criticized status this review resulted in an increase to our criticized asset level of billion in the quarter as you would expect indiscernible on the industries referenced in the chart hospitality retail airport parking and auto suppliers the customers in these affected industries except for auto indiscernible to a full recovery and indiscernible to move those credits to criticized status we will take a patient approach to working with these customers and currently do not see significant loss content of the of the downgrades we did not attribute to covid most of that was in our oil and gas portfolio slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter our credit performance on the whole was strong net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases the commercial chargeoffs were centered in the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately of the total commercial net chargeoffs i would also point out that nearly all these oil and gas chargeoffs resulted from loan sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as we prudently reduced our exposure to this industry annualized total net chargeoffs excluding the oil and gas related losses were basis points demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in  consumer chargeoffs were down to basis points in  demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio as always weve provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides the nonperforming asset ratio increased basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear to basis points due to the oil and gas impact i described earlier let me turn it back over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you rich turning to slide i will provide our expectations for the third quarter as was the case last quarter we feel its prudent to limit our guidance to the current quarter due to the ongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook as steve alluded to earlier weve confidence in our businesses and are pleased with our second quarter results given the headwinds in the quarter our sentiment has improved from days ago due to the recent trends were seeing and the actions weve taken to better position the bank for success going forward looking at the average balance sheet for the third quarter we expect average loans to be approximately flat on a linked quarter basis consumer loans are expected to increase approximately driven by continued growth in the residential mortgage and rv and marine lending commercial loans are expected to decrease approximately as the full quarter impact of ppp is more than offset by continued reductions in dealer floorplan and commercial loan utilization rates our current projections assume the majority of the ppp balances will remain on the balance sheet through the end of the year our early stage commercial pipelines have been building over the past several weeks supporting the expectation of accelerating growth in the latter part of the year we balance this customer optimism with an acknowledgement of the fluidity of the current economy and some concern that the recent upward trend in the inflection could dampen the pace of the economic recovery we expect average total deposits to decrease approximately linked quarter commercial deposits are expected to decrease approximately assuming gradual usage of deposit inflows from the government stimulus we expect total revenue to increase approximately linked quarter with the net interest income increasing to we expect gaap nim to expand approximately to basis points versus the second quarter nim of as a result of the hedging strategy and the elimination of notable items which negatively impacted the second quarter namely basis points of reduced loan rate fees and basis points of derivative ineffectiveness huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 mark our nim expectation does not include material benefit from the acceleration of ppp fees from the repayment or forgiveness of those loans in the third quarter we expect fee income to be approximately flat as mortgage banking activity remains robust and pandemic impacted revenue lines rebound based on the debit card trends we would expect a slight pickup in cardrelated fees in the third quarter deposit account activity volumes are increasing yet given the elevated level of consumer deposits we do not expect a full recovery in deposit service charges these increases are expected to be offset by reduced other income as the second quarter contained gains of million related to the annuitization of a retiree health plan and the retirement plan services recordkeeping business sales as i mentioned earlier we are benefiting from the expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of in addition given both the significant economic challenges of and the desire to selffund some of the compelling initiatives being identified in our ongoing strategic planning process we are now executing the expense management program we have previewed for you on prior calls as i mentioned previously our outlook to this plan is focused on four categories of expenses the size and compensation level of the organization structural expenses including our branch and corporate facilities investments primarily the optimization of the level of marketing and lastly other discretionary expenses this program is sized to generate approximately million of annual savings in and in this cost rationalization will allow the bank to prudently manage expenses given the economic and business uncertainty that exists this year weve modeled numerous scenarios for the financial outlook with the majority of these forecasts achieving positive operating leverage for inclusive of the expected approximately million of restructuring costs related to the expense management program importantly weve been positioning the company for some time to be ready to capitalize on opportunities to drive accelerated revenue and market share growth that will arise when the economic recovery begins to solidify while our longerterm planning for is still a work in process our current expectation is that we continue to see positive signs of economic stabilization and regrowth well accelerate investments in digital technology capabilities product differentiation and other strategic initiatives in the latter part of and into next year potentially utilizing up to the full amount of these savings for this purpose in calendar year thus this program provides the opportunity to fund these initiatives while generally maintaining a strong expense efficiency level in focusing on the expense outlook for the third quarter we expect noninterest expenses to increase approximately on a linked quarter basis approximately of this growth is driven by the million of the total approximately million restructuring costs associated with the expense management actions that wed recognize in the third quarter the remaining approximately is driven by investments in technology and marketing as well as the return of customer and sales activity closer to prepandemic levels finally we expect net chargeoffs in the third quarter to be near basis points this is reflective of the potential chargeoffs in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic considerations fundamentally our credit remains sound however the economic outlook remains uncertain and were likely to see elevated provision expense through the remainder of mark muth directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 michelle we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc nice job theres a lot of places to go but lets just talk oil and gas to get that out of the way longer term whats the plan there is it just to get down to million or million what you call your core portfolio and if you could maybe project is it are you done in  or are you done in  when does the noise start to go away from this portfolio richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey jon its rich with respect to the oil and gas piece of it weve got it bifurcated into a core and noncore sector and the focus is really on getting that noncore piece of the portfolio down and through whatever methods we have and you saw in  that we sold million to the extent that weve got opportunities where we think the sale price is better than what a recovery might be if the credit got into trouble we would certainly do that as it relates to the ongoing strategy were not originating any new loans in that space we havent for over a year now i think were really just focused on the portfolio we have now and managing the risk there stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon this is probably the last quarter were going to distinguish ourselves with reporting out the oil and gas like this because we believe weve got indiscernible fully reserved and while youll see metrics around that we dont feel a need to call it out like we have this quarter picking up in the normal course then well look to maximize the portfolio particularly ph in our core over time huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right and then just a followup the rest of it looks so clean from a credit perspective and zach you talked about the third quarter fourth quarter provisions remaining elevated i see it acl and relatively retained credit metrics i guess the question is how much a reserve build do you think you still need and how do you want us to think through that third quarter and fourth quarter provisioning level richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey jon its rich ill take that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc we havent really thought about whether a build in the third quarter would look like as you work through the seasonal methodology it is a point in time process and so similar to what we did in  we will do the same process in  we will look at what the change in the economic outlook might be for the end of september were certainly not going to race into anything earlier in the quarter and were going to take every available day we have to look at the economic condition and the forecast that we see well also have another quarter of portfolio activity to see how the portfolio is behaving relative to our expectations and based on those two factors well look at where we think the provision indiscernible so its really hard for us to sit here and really indiscernible forecast additional builds its really a quarter by quarter kind of step by step process stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc but jon we do like generally how the portfolio has performed thus far and feel good having looked at a very substantial amount of the commercial portfolio in depth during the quarter and tried to have a realistic if not conservative lens look which is reflected in some of the metrics like the criticized loan increase but the performance for the quarter was frankly better than we would have expected it to be at the core and were but weve got a recurrence of the virus it looks like coming and we dont know what the fourth round if it happens indiscernible theres a lot of unknowns here so its very very difficult to project where this is indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on your comment right there you just mentioned to jon about looking at the reserves each quarter and you just mentioned youll look at the behavior of your credits versus your expectations isnt that a dynamic that under cecl should have already been factored into the reserve in terms of how the credits are actually behaving versus what your model because now youre providing a lifetime loss expectation richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no thats right and i thought my comment was meant to mean that we will look at how the portfolio if there are changes in the portfolio from the end of  to the end of  john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay so what about the growth then versus the underlying credit richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well it could be growth it could also be changes in underlying credit i mean to the extent that there is further deterioration or improvement either way in the portfolio that gets reflected in the modeled outputs for what would go into  john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it and then i guess so if the reserve right now excluding ppp loans does represent your best expectation of the lifetime loss content of your loan portfolio how do you attribute the difference between that ratio and your company run most recent dfast estimate that you did does it all comes down to the macro assumptions and the amount of stimulus that youre factoring in richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah we havent disclosed the company run dfast scenarios but certainly there is going to be a number of factors that will go into what weve provided in our forecast versus what were just running through the models huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay i got it and then lastly just want to ask about the cadence of the cost saves sort of the million could you talk about how i know you mentioned a portion in and then the rest in could you just talk about how we can expect the timing of that to play out zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure this is zach john thanks for the question so as i mentioned its about a million save in both years and over time the like weve said many times in the past we want to manage the expense base based on the revenue outlook and so a very substantial chunk of that million wed expect to flow to the bottom line in and not be reinvested to the extent that we see the economy improving as we go forward and the pace and the level of that recovery because were certain would expect to start to rev up the investments as i mentioned in my prepared remarks and therefore have a less or potentially even neutral net benefit from that in as we go forward but for just to kind of come back to your question specifically around a third of that save accrued to the second quarter and so its around million left on a gross basis before any modest acceleration investments in the back half of the year and before the million restructuring costs in  and  john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks zach its helpful zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning i was just wondering if you could help us walk through the impact of ppp in terms of the yield youre seeing on that portfolio what it added to nii and zach i know you said that forgiveness is not built into the forecast but how are you generally anticipating it to go going forward thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks for the question let me try to put some math behind this for you so just starting first with the yield it was accretive to yield in the second quarter by as we noted about basis points of net interest margin really what drives that is the portfolio rate we were seeing in june was on an accrual basis for those loans in june which was made up of of the underlying yield and then the amortization ph award for us based on the size mix of our loan of ppp our ppp loans was around placement fee over the life of the loan so the combination of those two things for june was and hence additive to the overall nim by around basis points it was around million of revenue in  as well as we go forward into  from a nim perspective i think its accretive by around basis point is our current estimate so its a tiny drag on a quarterto quarter basis of basis point down but pretty neutral in that respect into the third quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 in terms of the forgiveness i think is the other part of your question this continues to be a function of estimates as you might imagine but our planning estimate at this point is that a roughly of the loans outstanding will be forgiven the process around that is the thing thats driving the most uncertainty around the timing and so right now were assuming that the loans less than each which is around billion of the billion loans will be on a likely on a fast track forgiveness process and hence will likely be forgiven in the fourth quarter so thats our planning assumption for that and then lets say around of the remaining greater than loans are forgiven in  which would make about onequarter of the total billion forgiven in  with the remainder of forgiven of whats going to be forgiven in  so i think by the end of the year we expect on an average basis in  we still expect to see around billion of ppp in the fourth quarter coming down to around million by  of next year does that indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay yeah and just a followup the million you recognized in when you get a full quarter of it in what are you ballparking that to turn into i know you put it in nim terms directionally but in terms of dollar terms zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thats a good question million roughly in  ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steve janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc this is janet lee on for steve ive a followup question on energy so your energy levels are at of total exposure and this being fully reserved for the loss content can you just share with us some of the key underlying assumptions baked into these reserve levels such as a trajectory of energy chargeoff npls and credit size going from here as well as some of the macro factors like where you think the oil price indiscernible thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yeah its rich janet we took a number of factors as we kind of sized the reserve build there when we looked at the core and noncore portfolios there are a number of factors that went into that designation whether its liquidity and but a big piece of that is borrowing base coverage and that lasts as long as the hedges lasts and so our challenge with the book in general is just our view in where commodity prices are going to go and as the hedges roll off theres just more exposure to what we think is a pretty uneconomical level of price to support drilling and more important to support capital so the seasonality of the oil and gas business will drive some of the chargeoff decisions as you would expect the spring and fall borrowing base redetermination are a big driver of kind of a fresh look at whether the loans are relative to the collateral and thats part of what we saw in the second quarter was the spring redetermination results kind of flowing through and indiscernible proactive in terms of getting out of credits ph there were four structural overadvances in deals in our book in the second quarter we sold two of them and moved the other two to npa so i think as it relates to further npa growth that will be really based more around borrowing base redetermination periods the chargeoffs will be a function largely of if there are sale opportunities and also around borrowing base redetermination janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats helpful and i think last quarter you disclosed billion exposure in leveraged lending comprised of a number of different industries some of your peers experienced some chargeoffs in the leveraged lending portfolio i just want to see like how this portfolio is performing anything abnormal youre seeing on the credit side thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah as it relates to the leveraged lending the portfolio did go up modestly in the second quarter went up by about to really due to fallen angel activity more than anything it relates to new originations as you might recall weve got a fairly modest leverage threshold for leveraged loans its times senior as opposed to most people did times so to the extent that these credits with the first quarter results kind of fell into that criteria we designated them fallen angels and removed them from the leveraged lending bucket we did not have any leveraged lending originated chargeoffs in  we are keeping an eye on them from indiscernible standpoint there were some downgrades within that book as you might expect but nothing significant janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking my questions richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc okay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens inc please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 hi thanks good morning richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi i just was wondering if you could discuss the health of the auto dealer portfolio i know its an area of focus last quarter you mentioned earlier on the call that inventory levels are lower and there was some incremental reserve build here in the second quarter richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah the auto floorplan business is actually bouncing back in very good shape we had about billion of deferrals deferred pi in that book and that is all going to roll off in the third quarter theres very the demand notwithstanding the fact that the new car inventories are down june results were very strong across our dealer book and so we expect that book barring any further shutdowns or things like that to bounce back pretty quickly the challenge for that sector is just getting inventory and they dont think that they will be back indiscernible inventory levels on their ph last before the end of the year so there was not much in the way at all of reserve build as it relates to the floorplan volume terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and the indirect loans indiscernible richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure the indirect is performing very well you can see the deferral piece of that was fairly modest to start with about im sorry about of the book and coming out of the deferral the payment rates are very strong indiscernible paying has increased coming out of the deferral so we are watching that like were watching all the consumer portfolios just given the impact of the deferrals on the overall book but that is a high fico book we have a custom score card and that book has performed very well through the dfast exercises and we expect it to continue to perform well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then just as a followup thanks for page the bottom right the volume thanks for updating that exhibit just the decline in the last couple weeks or maybe the last month in volume and transactions is that just a shortterm blip or are you seeing just the increase in number of covid cases beginning to impact volume overall zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre taking about the debit card volume terry huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc correct correct bottom right zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach so weve seen its like a roughly yearoveryear reduction in the last week versus the prior days so i think in the first days of july ph deferred volumes were up about yearon year in the last week they were up so not even i guess as i talked to you about the numbers and i think as we look across industries we are seeing a little bit of a blip down i was studying the numbers this morning and one of the industries where were seeing a most substantial blip sort of not surprisingly is in restaurants and bars so likely that is to some degree impacted by what were seeing in terms of some of the economic reopening guidance changing and things of that nature but were still seeing pretty robust snapping back in yearoveryear growth overall terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks most of the high points have been covered i was wondering if you could just talk about the mortgage and what your expectations are for the remainder of the year it seems a bit like covid has kind of pushed out the spring selling season obviously weve got a massive change in rates can you sustain your performance here longer than you would in a normal year i guess stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc brock what were seeing in the market here is that its a lack of inventory weve had very good very strong sales so the construction is not keeping phase with demand and youre seeing that flow through in terms of number of levels of inventory in a number of markets i should say so weve had a very strong performance on the housing front and we think that will continue as a consequence of the virus and its somewhat labor constrained on the build or supply side brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yeah and the primary secondary mortgage spreads have been kind of juiced up with all the damage in the fixed income markets do you see that rapidly coming in here in the third quarter or is that more sustainable which would support mortgage banking ph reps zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill just tack on to some of steves comments and try to address that answer the question generally i think the outlook for  is pretty similar to  in terms of volumes and a modest tightening of spread it was sort of around basis points to basis points lower spread as that trend continues weve been seeing for a while i think the outlook for  is harder to ascertain at this point just based on the timing of pipeline and things of that nature and clearly the pipeline for  or for  looks pretty similar to what it did for  with that being said our planning assumption is that the spreads will continue to come down in  and that volumes are typically seasonally a fair amount lower in  and well also see that downdraft as well so i think the trends you noted are in fact happening the velocity with which they happen is still a question mark brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and on the deposit fees due to some of those waivers fees were kind of lighter how quickly can that come back richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah were assuming that some of them come back in the third quarter i think really its going to be a function of how quickly the deposits on the sheets start to get used i think this is a phenomenon that weve noted across the entire industry that the deposit gathering activity in the second quarter was just extremely robust and what weve seen in our own portfolio was around we estimate on the consumer side the government stimulus and some of the unemployment benefits are being saved in accounts and thats only ticking down singledigit percentage points per month as we go forward so its hard to say because thats going to be the key driver is what happens with overall deposits and therefore some overdraft activity with that being said were expecting a modest increase as we move into the third quarter and then as sort of indicated in our comments  is harder to ascertain at this point brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you ladies and gentlemen weve reached the end of our questionandanswer session id like to turn the
