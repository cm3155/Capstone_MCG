support were pleased with our fullyear results and the continued momentum across the bank despite a challenging operating environment for the full year we reported earnings per common share of an increase of over return on average assets for was return on average common equity was and return on average tangible common equity was the bank achieved record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year our balance sheet is very wellpositioned with robust capital and liquidity and our comprehensive hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk credit quality remains strong with net chargeoffs at the low end of our average through the cycle target range we remain prudent with our allocation of capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk profile marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend coupling the dividend with million of share repurchases during the year we returned over billion to our shareholders in which represented a total payout ratio of as we previously communicated on many instances our capital priorities are first to fund organic growth second to support the cash dividend and finally all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions these capital priorities have not changed now moving to the economy we continue to see growth and our expectation for is for continued expansion consumers continue to perform well across our footprint with strong labor markets driving wage inflation in the months ending november unemployment rates declined or remained the same in of the largest msas in huntingtons footprint states job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in the midwest home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in michigan indiana and ohio additionally consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since the positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer lending businesses our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full year and the fourth quarter our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter and we expect another good year in for our consumer lending businesses again driven primarily by residential mortgage and auto finance now we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the measured tone from some of our commercial customers economic uncertainty along with tight labor markets remain headwinds for more robust economic growth in our footprint overall huntington is performing well with disciplined organic growth our customers are generally confident about their performance for and we share that confidence in our performance we continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals with midcorporate lending technology media and telecom our practice finance area which we announced as part of the strategic plan huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 looking out to we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth reduce our future expense growth and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses and technology we repositioned billion of securities picking up approximately basis points of yield on those securities the rebalance resulted in million of security losses in the fourth quarter on the expense side we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation of instore branches now these actions along with the disposition of other properties and the technology system decommission resulted in unusual expense of approximately million in the quarter our disciplined expense management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology and enterprise growth initiatives going forward im confident in our positioning entering and our colleagues are focused in executing our plans we are all aligned with our strategies of creating a highperforming regional bank and delivering top quartile throughthe cycle shareholder returns zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everybody its a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call with huntington slides and provide highlights of our fullyear and fourth quarter results respectively many of which steve already touched on fourth quarter results include approximately million of pretax impact or approximately per share after tax from previously announced actions that were taken to better position the bank for including the securities repositioning workforce actions and the pending instore branch closures lets turn to slide to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind the financial performance for the quarter average earning assets increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter average loans and leases increased billion or yearoveryear with balanced consumer and commercial loan growth average commercial and industrial loans increased from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our yearoveryear loan growth ci loan growth has been welldiversified over the past year with notable growth in specialty banking asset finance and corporate banking our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations as a portion of deals we expected to close at the end of the year were pushed into and seasonal declines in line utilization at yearend were larger than normal overall commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average cre loans reflecting a yearoveryear decrease driven by paydowns and refinancing activity consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting robust originations in the second half of average residential mortgage loans increased yearoveryear as we typically do we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 now turning to slide average total deposits decreased less than yearoveryear while average core deposits increased yearoveryear note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by the june sale of the wisconsin retail branch network including approximately million or almost of core deposits we continue to see a migration in deposit balances from cds and savings into money market accounts reflecting shifting customer preferences and we are focused and where we are focused on promotional pricing average money market deposits increased yearoveryear while savings decreased and core cds decreased we expect this dynamic to continue in average noninterestbearing and interestbearing dda accounts each increased yearoveryear as shown on slide in the appendix were very pleased that our commercial noninterestbearing deposits increased year overyear in the quarter this growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low cost deposit base through new customer acquisition and relationship deepening moving now to slide fte net interest income decreased million or versus the yearago quarter primarily driven by the basis point decline in net interest margin partially offset by increase in average earning assets net interest margin was for the quarter down basis points from the yearago quarter down basis points linked quarter and in line with the guidance we provided at the goldman sachs conference in december moving to slide our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the yearago quarter purchase accounting accretion contributed basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to basis points in the yearago quarter slide in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of firstmerit purchase accounting for and please note that this quarter is the last quarter we intend to provide core nim and paa breakouts as the paa is expected to have a relatively immaterial impact in turning to earning asset yields our commercial loan yields decreased basis points yearoveryear consumer loan yields decreased basis points and security yields decreased basis points the decrease in our earning asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the three federal reserve rate reductions that occurred during on the funding side of the balance sheet our deposit costs continue to move lower as cds and money market promotional rates reprice lower and we actively managed commercial deposit costs total interestbearing deposit costs of basis points for the quarter were up yearoveryear though down basis points sequentially slide summarizes the actions weve taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment our hedging strategies reduced the downside risk from lower interest rates and have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest income our current interest rate risk modeling suggests little change to net interest income from either a basis point increase or basis point decrease in we continuously monitor and well continue to prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate the graphs on the bottom left of the slide detail the mix of our loan portfolio as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with repricing events in the first half of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 these repricing events provide an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits as these higher priced cds and promotional money market accounts reprice lower through december the consumer deposit repricing activity is on track with our expectations the success of our consumer deposit repricing and retention has provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in our commercial deposit pricing particularly among the highest cost deposits the graph on the bottom right of the slide displays the impact of our actions you can see the downward trajectory of our total interestbearing deposit costs by month since july we expect this trend to continue given the significant deposit repricing opportunities that remain in the first half of turning to slide you can see it provides the detail on our noninterest income which increased from the year ago quarter the growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income which increased primarily reflecting higher saleable origination volume and secondary market spreads as well as a million increase in the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management we also continued to see steady growth in card and payment processing income trust and investment management and insurance in the fourth quarter we repositioned billion of securities picking up approximately basis points of yield on those securities prospectively at a cost of million in  while negatively impacting fourth quarter results the prospective earnings pickup and the earnback on the repositioning losses are very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio the yearago quarter in included million of securities losses from similar repositioning slide provides the components of the yearoveryear decrease in noninterest expense the fourth quarter included million of expense related to the actions which steve discussed earlier while the yearago quarter included million of similar branch and facility consolidation related expense adjusting for these items noninterest expenses were essentially flat we continue to drive efficiency in our core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel our investments in digital mobile and cyber technology enhanced products and services and distribution capabilities this disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year slide illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at up basis points from a year ago and common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended the quarter at or basis points yearoveryear we continue to manage cet1 to the high end of our to operating guidelines during the fourth quarter of we repurchased million common shares at an average cost of per share or a total of million we plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital following the cecl implementation back to a cet1 level near by the end of excluding the benefit of the cecl transition provision provided by the federal reserve we feel managing internally to a cet1 level excluding the threeyear transition reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios which we see as a position of strength for the organization as a result we are currently planning to repurchase less than a third of the remaining million of share repurchase capacity on our capital plan in the first half of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 now let me turn it over to rich to cover credit including cecl go ahead rich richard a pohle chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks zach slide provides an update on our cecl adoption we estimate our allowance for credit losses or acl will increase from the year end acl to billion or of total loans and leases on an adjusted basis as we stated on the third quarter call given our mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans the cecl lifetime loss methodology results in a higher allowance than the prior methodology the increase in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio as we move forward under cecl it is a new accounting standard with many variables our day two allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models that incorporate multiple scenarios historical loss and recovery rates borrower characteristics and other factors as a result we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning expense our parallel testing however indicates that key factors being held constant the aggregate annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change from the current incurred loss methodology despite that higher quarterly variability slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter despite challenges in our oil and gas portfolio our credit metrics remain strong as we have noted previously some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of huntingtons core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite net chargeoffs remain near the low end of our average throughthecycle target range of to basis points net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter flat to the prior quarter and up from basis points in the yearago quarter the increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately half of the total commercial net chargeoffs this portfolio was primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity prices and limited capital markets activity we have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio representing less than of total loans and we believe we have it appropriately reserved for consumer chargeoffs have remained fairly consistent over the past year there is additional granularity on chargeoffs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides annual net chargeoffs excluding the million of oil and gas related losses were basis points and just basis points for the commercial portfolio the non performing asset ratio increased basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear to again primarily as a result of the stress in our oil and gas book the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remain relatively stable at down basis point versus the linked quarter let me turn it back over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks rich slide illustrates our expectations for fullyear we expect to be another year of sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies we expect fullyear huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 average loan growth in the range of to with continued growth in both consumer and commercial portfolios we expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side focused in home lending and auto finance we expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data fullyear average deposit growth is expected to be approximately to as we remain focused on acquiring forward checking accounts and deepening customer relationships specifically our expectation entails continued decline in cds more than offset by growth in checking and money market we expect fullyear total revenue growth of to on a gaap basis with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income we are projecting the nim to rebound in the first half of from the fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second half of the year given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning we remain confident in our outlook for net interest income growth while deposit pricing remains rationale in our markets we are closely watching the competitive environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and opportunity for variance to our nim forecast we expect noninterest income on a gaap basis to grow at a slightly higher pace than total revenue in driven by the continued focus on deepening customer relationships fullyear noninterest expense is expected to increase to based on our active management in we are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory our focus is on driving continued investment in opportunities to further differentiate huntington and drive revenue growth as weve told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions and our guidance we remain committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage we anticipate that the fullyear net chargeoffs will be within a range of basis points to basis points as rich just covered fundamentally our credit remains strong were taking decisive action to mitigate the risk in our oil and gas portfolio as a result we have expectations for oil and gas chargeoffs remaining slightly elevated in the first half of these charges are fully represented in our guidance we believe we are adequately reserved at yearend and with the lifeofloan cecl adoption our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the to range mark muth directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc operator well now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning lots to ask about but ill just maybe start steve with just you talked a little bit about headwinds in commercial but we do have usmca and phase china seemingly done just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on that and if youre seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial customers stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon usmca has just recently done and obviously there are other issues and distractions going on in dc right now so i dont think theres a meaningful change yet but from what we reported at the prior conference and i do expect theres going to be a second half im optimistic in that regard but i think its going to be a little hesitant little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year we did see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year so spot balances were down a bit from where we expected them to be that was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash on sheet so i think that just reflects this conservatism and just sort of a wait and see approach again in the midwest were hampered by lack of labor so that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and then just one more zach or rich maybe rich for you just can you talk about the day two cecl impact again i think what you said is you expect the provision to be roughly the same in compared to i wonder if i heard that right and zach how you want us to think about provisioning in thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 yeah this is rich the testing that weve done and again this is new so were kind of going through quarterby quarter the testing that we did cecl to bau showed that there were some quarterly volatility but over the course of the year it tended to level itself out so we dont see a lot of volatility we see more volatility on a quarterly basis going forward but we dont expect a material change in the overall provision under cecl than we had under the incurred loss methodology jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thats helpful thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks operator our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james please proceed with your question david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi david good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc with your revenue outlook for the year what is the rate backdrop that you are assuming right now zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc this is zach ill take that question david good talk with you were essentially assuming the forward yield curve as it existed in november although its relatively consistent with where it looks right now the fed funds expectation is relatively neutral i think that the actual forward rate look at it precisely included forecasted one rate cut sort of in the late summertime period but i think as we noted in the prepared remarks based on our hedging program our net interest income and nim is essentially neutralized from one rate increase or one rate decrease from today so i would say sort of taking a step back sort of roughly flat from where we are today david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 got it and if the rate backdrop goes against you do you have additional levers that you can pull on the expense side so you can still produce positive operating leverage zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes we do i think under most realistic rate scenarios as i mentioned the hedging program will keep our nim pretty constant so were not expecting to pull those expense levers but as always we do have a number of expense levers that weve got at our disposal ill take down a few of them we can always look at the pacing and phasing of our strategic growth initiatives weve got the number one branch share in michigan and ohio and so looking at our branch network and the cost around that is an opportunity and i think generally as we see revenue soften we typically see the linked variable expense reduction from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that so those are the levers weve got ph as well we look at all the time there are other levers like staffing contingency plans which you saw us pull in the fourth quarter of which are at our disposal but again its not our expectation that well have to do that in the last thing i would just say is you commented positive operating leverage we are managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it appreciate the color thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc yes this is rahul patil on behalf of john i just have a twopart question on your auto lending business considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in this space are you seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you have previously expected and then the second part is tied to cecl the cecl implementation impact your appetite for auto loans going forward just trying to gauge whats your auto loan growth outlook following a flattish average balance in richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah john sic rahul its rich ill take that so ill take the second question first so as it relates to cecl the auto business is really neutral the weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that much different than what we had under the incurred loss methodology so its a fairly benign impact from a cecl standpoint as it huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 relates to the overall business strategy i think we have just a tremendous franchise across multiple states with thousands of dealers that weve got the ability to drive volume i think we are in a very high fico band that tends to be more price sensitive than others so i dont see us having any real issues in meeting the origination goals that weve got from the indirect auto business in rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay and then last quarter i believe youd indicated that the consensus nim estimate around that time of for full year was reasonable but i believe that you had assumed earlier a couple of rate cuts in that nim guidance could you just discuss your updated thoughts i know you talked about rebound in first half and then stable but are you still comfortable with that level right now zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks for the question this is zach ill answer that one so the answer is yes we are still comfortable with the approximately guidance that we talked about in december at the goldman sachs conference and then just reiterated today in the prepared remarks we expect the trajectory of that to be ticking higher than the first quarter sort of stabilizing around that level by mid second quarter and then oscillating around that level through the balance of the year theres really a couple big drivers of that so the most substantial of which is the repricing of the deposit maturities that we talked about in the prepared remarks theres roughly billion repricing in  and another billion repricing in  and so far were really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that which is proceeding according to our plans the other factor which a little smaller but still helpful is the basis points of pickup we got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier so those two factors are whats driving that and helping us to get the nim back to with that being said theres a couple of factors were watching asset yields on new production ph although your previous question around auto and residential we continue to see them where we want them but thats something we look at very carefully the other one is as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the volume and rate for the deposit costs again were seeing the trend on our expectation but its something that well continue to watch those are the biggest factors that could cause the nim to be higher or lower than that rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay and then i just want to clarify one thing and that is assuming a rate cut in december of this year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes assuming essentially the forward rate curve that exists in november as i mentioned which if you look precisely at the fed funds expectation in that had one cut over the late summer time period but even if its flat were going to be roughly indiscernible rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 okay perfect thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys good morning one more question on the stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good morning one more question on the deposit side of things to see what youre expecting for total growth im assuming thats still coming from core customer growth you mentioned the billion thats going to reprice underneath that can you just talk about whats happening in your markets as far as just underlying core deposit pricing and if thats still also coming down aside from what youre just scheduled is going to reprice from the rollovers zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean i think were as i said were seeing the repricing activity be pretty much in line with our expectations ticking down but also being somewhat competitive so we assumed and planned for the rate environment weve got right now and were seeing it trend in that way mark muth a directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc yeah ken this is mark i would say that generally what were seeing on the consumer side is very rational and as we would have expected and the repricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention has allowed us to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side which we do see as more competitive if you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there it definitely is on the commercial side and particularly with your large dollar deposits on the commercial side and weve just allowed some of those to leave the bank as a result of the success were having on consumer side ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and then one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet with pretty good loan growth and pretty good deposit growth what do you see happening in terms of both the size securities portfolio and can you talk about the underlying dynamics of in a stable rates environment your front book back book zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 so the expectation for the securities portfolio this is zach roughly constant with where we are today no material change we like where is at and thats the expectation at this point the second part of the question was stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc front book back book zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc back book ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc rolling off securities and rolling on if rates stay low stay where they are from here whats the dynamic happening in there thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well take that offline i dont have that detail right in front of me mark muth a directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc yeah ken ive got
