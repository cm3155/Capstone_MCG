and welcome thank you for joining the call today we are very pleased to announce our fourth quarter results which included gaap net income of million and adjusted net income of million for the fullyear reported gaap net income was billion and adjusted net income was billion both results reflect record earnings for huntington marked a year of numerous successes driven by our teams execution of organic growth initiatives realization of both expense and revenue synergies from the tcf acquisition and unwavering focus on credit discipline and proactive balance sheet management we ended the year with substantial momentum clearly the economic environment is becoming increasingly challenging however huntington is better positioned today than at any time since i joined over a dozen years ago and over those years weve transformed the risk profile of the bank and remained highly disciplined we are taking proactive steps now to again position huntington to outperform and we enter the year with solid capital levels toptier reserves a growing core deposit base and strong credit metrics we continue to see opportunities to grow revenue and profit now on to slide first we finished the year with our fourth consecutive quarter of record preprovision net revenue this was supported by higher interest income driven by earning asset growth and an expanded net interest margin revenue growth has been exceptional over the course of the year and we intend to protect and grow that revenue base second we delivered broad based loan growth ex ppp of yearoveryear as we drove this growth we also optimized for return while still exceeding our loan growth outlook one example of this optimization is indirect auto where our production in the quarter was approximately lower than the prior quarter while our new loan yields increased by over basis points importantly we continued to grow our deposit base with multiple consecutive quarters of growth we believe this is a differentiator for huntington in this environment it also demonstrates the breadth of our franchise and our colleagues ability to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships third our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the toptier return profile and were at or above our medium term targets these results demonstrate the earnings power of the company and we expect to continue to deliver on these targets as we intended we delivered common equity tier capital to the middle of our to operating range we are also very pleased to announce a new twoyear share repurchase program fourth we ended with strong momentum across the business that we carry into this new year we remain focused on growth aligned with our risk appetite importantly we have the capital credit reserves and strength of balance sheet that give us confidence to continue to deliver on our organic growth priorities slide highlights the tremendous earnings power of the franchise which has improved sequentially over the course of the year ppnr is over higher than prepandemic levels our return on tangible common equity is top tier we managed our asset sensitivity throughout the year and deliberately positioned the company to benefit from higher interest rates which resulted in significant revenue growth weve also been prudent in taking actions to protect this revenue base should we experience lower rates over the next few years we will continue to be dynamic in this regard with our goal of reducing volatility and creating a tight corridor around the path of spread revenue huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 at our investor day in november we shared with you our highly defined set of strategic priorities we expect these strategies will drive sustained revenue growth and support gains in efficiency over the longterm as you also heard this management team is a group of experienced operators to further accelerate the execution of these strategies and support increased efficiency we will be taking a series of actions during to align our organizational structure with a focus on our critical priorities we expect these actions will result in new growth and efficiency opportunities we will share more details on these actions as theyre finalized over the course of the first quarter however one element will be a voluntary retirement program for our middle and senior management overall i believe this program will be important to support our colleagues and create value for our shareholders in closing we are well positioned for continued growth we have the strategies the momentum in our businesses to support growth we also benefit from highly engaged colleagues whove consistently delivered outstanding customer service and are a true differentiator weve the credit discipline to outperform and remain focused on rigorous expense management investment prioritization and capital allocation we remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive annual operating leverage and are intently focused on driving shareholder value zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our fourth quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of and adjusted eps was return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was further adjusting for aoci rotce was loan balances continued to expand as total loans increased by billion and excluding ppp increased by billion deposit balances increased by billion on an end of period basis while average deposits were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter preprovision net revenue expanded sequentially by from last quarter to million and on a full year basis yearoveryear increased by to billion credit quality remains strong with net chargeoffs of basis points and nonperforming assets declining to basis points turning to slide average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter driven by both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans continue to represent the majority of loan growth within commercial excluding ppp average loans increased by billion or from the prior quarter primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance which increased million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels as well as seasonality with shipments of winter equipment arriving to dealers we also saw the continued longterm trend of demand within our asset finance businesses which drove balances million higher in the quarter commercial real estate balances increased by million largely as a result of production late in the third quarter and lower prepays end of period balances were higher by million auto floorplan utilization continued to normalize which drove balances higher by million additional increases in line utilization over time represents a substantial ongoing opportunity we also saw higher balances in specialty verticals such as midcorporate and tech and telecom which were offset by lower balances in other areas as a result of our return optimization initiatives in consumer growth was huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 led by residential mortgage which increased by million as on sheet production outpaced runoff and was supported by slower prepaid speeds partially offsetting this growth were lower auto balances which declined by million and rvmarine which declined by million turning to slide we delivered billion of deposit growth for the quarter and billion for the year on an ending basis on an average basis deposits were lower by while increasing yearoveryear competition for deposits has intensified beginning in earnest in september and continuing into the fourth quarter notwithstanding that we are pleased with the traction we saw over the course of the quarter as our teams delivered robust production demonstrating the deposit gathering capabilities across the bank ending deposit growth was led by consumer which increased by billion we saw a mix shift in line with our expectations including incremental growth in both money market and time deposits we continue to remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at basis points for the fourth quarter we will remain dynamic balancing core deposit growth the competitive rate environment and the utilization of a broad range of funding options on slide we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and nim core net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion increased by million or to billion net interest margin expanded basis points on a gaap basis from the prior quarter and expanded basis points on a core basis excluding accretion slide highlights our high quality deposit base and diversified funding profile for the current cycle todate our beta on total cost of deposits was as we have noted we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle overall our beta continues to track to our expectations turning to slide throughout we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity we also incrementally added to our hedging program to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term during the quarter we executed a net billion of receivefixed swaps and million of forward starting swaption collars at this point based on the current rate outlook and yield curve opportunities we believe we have optimized the size of the program we are comfortable with our position today as we balance nearterm costs versus longer term protection as always we will be dynamic as we monitor the outlook and the yield curve we maintain unused hedge capacity that we could deploy should the curve revert andor steepen to a level where we would add incremental downside rate protection hedges on the securities portfolio we saw another stepup in reported yields quarteroverquarter we are benefiting from reinvestment as well as the hedge strategy to protect capital we will continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately billion each quarter at attractive new purchase yields around moving to slide noninterest income was million up million from last quarter we drove record activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter and throughout capstone continued to perform well and our underlying capital markets businesses outside of capstone finished the year strong up year overyear we remained pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business with another positive quarter of net asset flows on a yearoveryear basis we saw lower mortgage banking income as a result of the higher rate environment and from lower deposit service charges from fair play enhancements we implemented during offsetting these huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 factors were higher capital markets revenues and payments revenues importantly were executing on our strategy to drive higher value revenue streams and our fee mix continues to trend favorably moving on to slide gaap noninterest expense increased million compared to the prior quarter adjusted for notable items core expenses increased by million this quarterly increase in core expenses was primarily the result of revenuedriven compensation tied to capital markets production additionally we saw seasonally higher medical claims in the quarter which increased by million underlying these results core expenses were wellcontrolled demonstrating our commitment to disciplined expense management slide recaps our capital position common equity tier increased to our tangible common equity ratio or tce increased to adjusting for aoci our tce ratio was we ended the year having delivered on our plan to drive common equity tier to the middle of our to operating range going forward our capital priorities have not changed fund organic growth support our dividend and provide capacity for all other uses including share repurchases after having held back on share repurchases for the last several quarters our expectation is that over the course of and beyond we will now return to a more normalized capital distribution mix including share repurchases our board has authorized a billion share repurchase program through the end of given the current economic outlook our thinking is that we will not actively repurchase shares during the first half of as we watch the path of the economy this may result in capital ratios continuing to expand in the near term we like the flexibility the program provides and we believe it is prudent to maintain an authorized share repurchase program as part of our overall capital management framework on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter this was higher than last quarter by basis points and up basis points from the prior year as credit performance continues to normalize nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for six consecutive quarters criticized loans have similarly improved for four consecutive quarters allowance for credit losses was up slightly driving the coverage ratio higher to of total loans turning to slide you will note a strong reserve position as i mentioned the portfolio has continued to perform extraordinarily well and we believe our disciplined approach to credit through the cycle underpins the overall strength of our balance sheet we were pleased to update our mediumterm financial targets at investor day in november and these form the foundation of our expectations over our strategic planning horizon we believe these metrics are at the core of value creation profit growth return on capital and the commitment to drive positive annual operating leverage turning to slide let me share some thoughts on our outlook as we discussed at investor day we analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans our targets are anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook and the forward yield curve as of december the baseline assumes a mild recession in with modest net gdp growth for the full year the economy is expected to exit the year on a path toward recovery with inflation gradually subsiding since investor day the economic outlook is incrementally worse and is likely at the lower end of the baseline scenario outcomes our baseline outlook for is for average loans to grow between and led by commercial with more modest growth in consumer we will continue to focus on optimizing for returns and driving loan expansion in select areas deposits are expected to increase between and reflecting continued growth and deepening of customer and primary bank relationships huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 net interest income is expected to increase between and driven by continued earning asset growth and expanded full year net interest margin noninterest income is projected to be approximately flat we expect continued robust performance from our areas of strategic focus capital markets payments and wealth management during several other factors are offsetting that growth including our anticipated holding of the majority of our sba loan production on sheet thereby reducing nearterm fee revenue in favor of longer term high returns spread revenue lower income of approximately million associated with purchase accounting accretion in fees please refer to slide for more details lower operating lease revenue as we continue to transition to more capital leases importantly we expect this will result in lower operating lease depreciation expense as well lower mortgage banking income for the full year versus and finally in light of the economic outlook we are implementing risk mitigating deposit policy changes that will result in a lower incidence of overdrafts and related service charges in addition we are reducing nsf fees to zero in the first quarter this will result in an approximate million reduction in fee income per quarter which we expect to be more than offset by lower associated chargeoffs as you know the first quarter is generally a seasonal low for overall fee income we expect fee income will grow sequentially throughout the remainder of the year on expenses as steve noted we intend to hold growth to a low level given the environment even as we remain committed to funding critical longterm investments we plan to manage core underlying expense growth between and for the full year this level of expense growth benefits from the ongoing efficiency initiatives weve discussed previously such as operation accelerate branch optimization and the organizational alignment actions that steve highlighted added to the core expense growth we expect approximately million higher expenses from the full year run rate of capstone and torana and million of increased fdic insurance expense associated with the surcharge in addition we expect the first half of the year to include some amount of restructuring charges associated with the expense management actions we are taking we will provide more details about these actions later in the quarter overall our low expense growth coupled with expanded revenues is expected to support another year of positive operating leverage we expect net chargeoffs will be on the low end of our long term through the cycle range of basis points to basis points our guidance reflects the current macroeconomic outlook we will continue to be diligent in analyzing the macro environment and well react as needed to manage as the year plays out we ended in a position of strength and have good momentum we have every expectation of continuing to outperform this year with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow up and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question is from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey question on deposit growth you mentioned deposit competition has intensified quite a bit and we can see from the cd rates that youre offering in the market that youve been proactively raising those cd rates and offering more 14month cds so just given all of that can you talk about how much of the projected deposit growth in will be driven by cds and what the overall deposit mix is likely to look like zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure yeah this is zach ill take that question thank you for asking it generally speaking were seeing our deposit growth continuing to trend pretty well in line with the outlook that weve given between and growth for the full year so we think were on that run rate i think it will be balanced between both consumer and commercial and to your point well continue to the mix of that deposit gathering will continue to trend as we expected and it is baked into our overall rate and beta expectations for higher rate products like time deposits like money markets et cetera i think were operating in this rate cycle clearly at a lower level of mix of those products than we were for example in the last rate cycle so well clearly see that trend higher throughout the course of the next several quarters but in line with our general expectations it all comes back to our focus of deepening relationships with our existing customers and our primary bank relationships and so we think its working pretty well and expected to continue as we go out to manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe on the nim trajectory from here can you comment on if were close to peak and given what you said on the hedges and the fact that youre through the program at least for now how should we think about a floor for nim from here over the course of the next four to eight quarters if the fed does start cutting rates thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 yeah on the topic of nim i think lets take a step back weve significantly benefited over the last three quarters from our explicit actions to manage nim and to manage asset sensitivity seen more than basis points nim expansions in the last three quarters alone and it was very intentional with a mind toward continuing our top tier performance in nim over the course of long periods of time that weve done as we stand now as we start to look into we do believe theres more room to go on asset betas and well see yields continuing to increase out over the next few quarters however were further along in that process probably threequarters of the way through than we are on the deposit beta side where we also expected as we said rates continuing to track higher over the course of the next several quarters were probably only about halfway through the deposit beta cycle and when you couple that dynamic with what is currently the expectation on yield curve that well see shortend rates fall towards the latter part of it is reasonable to project a somewhat downward trajectory of nim over the course of our goal will be to manage nim as weve said on a number of occasions previously within as tight a corridor in as we can really protecting the downside with our hedging program and ultimately driving toward sequential and sustained growth in net interest income on a dollar basis and i think when we couple what we expect to be a pretty strong nim level overall with the loan growth that we expect to continue to drive again to the guidance to over the course of this year well see that nii on a dollar basis continuing to expand and so thats the focus manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steven zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 i want to start sort of follow up zach with the nim expected to trend down given all the hedges and protection youve put in place to sort of tighten that band can you frame for us how much downside could we see whats the range zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so thanks steven for the question look i think the trend is something on the order of single digits reduction on a kind of a quarterly basis as we go throughout theres a range of uncertainties so i want to be clear and not being overly precise you just think about all the factors that are going to play into that the fed funds actions which as you know from starting at the dot plots are not aligned with the market expectation and so how that all plays out i think is going to be the most important factor the pace of the trajectory of beta which at this point seems to be fairly well linear across time but well have to wait and see how that goes and clearly the big one is the economy and where that tracks over the near term so its difficult to be overly precise so im trying not to and bring back to the dollar growth our goal will be to drive nii on a dollar basis but as i said i do expect some downward trajectory in nim and its probably something on the order of single digits on a sequential basis each quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful and then zach when we look at youre obviously expecting more loan growth than deposit growth and fairly large issuance of sub debt this quarter could you walk us through the funding strategy i know you said you expect the overall growth in average earning assets but whats the funding strategy it seems like you have to do much more than just on the deposit side and maybe what will be the cost of that thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think its an important point and its something that we feel like its a point of strength and an advantage at this point in the cycle given that were coming to the early to middle stages of this cycle at still a very advantageous overall position in terms of loan to deposit ratio the mix of important categories of deposits like time deposits and our noncustomer funding kind of relative to history and so it allows us as ive mentioned on a number of previous occasions to utilize the balance source of funding if you look back at what happened in we grew loans at deposits were more than range clearly loan to deposit ratios tracked up and we used a broad range of other funding sources like longterm debt like the fhlb and other noncustomer sources to balance out the same is going to be true for albeit to a somewhat less degree thinking about loan growth in that mid to highsingle digits range to deposit growth in the to does imply well continue to see loan to deposit ratios tick up and youll see us therefore continuing to utilize other balanced funding sources like the federal home loan bank and other noncustomer sources of funding there the rates that were seeing are pretty reasonable the incremental economics certainly on that loan growth continue very accretive to return on capital and the overall cost of deposits and funding within that beta expectation indiscernible nim expectation that i just talked about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc in the second half of the question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you steven operator our next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning hey zach i wanted to ask you i know we talked about this last quarter the security swaps that you had added a nice amount of net interest income again and im just wondering can you help us understand just the benefit from that if ineffectiveness helped that again and just how does that grow like well how do we track that going forward relative to just interest rates in terms of the benefits that you should get from there zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah they were a very powerful benefit i think theyre protected as you know about a third of what wouldve otherwise been aoci indiscernible reduction which was their primary intention originally but also have played out in terms of really strong reported yields on the securities portfolio roughly half of the approximately bps increase in securities yield was from that hedging program to give you a sense of the scale and i think where it goes from here in terms of incremental benefit is going to be to some degree a function of just where that mid portion of the curve goes and at this point its fairly well topped out im not expecting a ton more lift there the lift from that has reduced somewhat from the third quarter but thats still very accretive were not adding to that portfolio now and so i think were getting the benefits that we expected from it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then one follow up on deposit beta total cumulative so far through the cycle can you just remind us what youre thinking about betas from here and just itd be super clear for us if you dont mind on i think you guys usually do talk on total zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah sure so it was to give you a sense just kind of tracking across time it was in  in  in  so continuing to track and kind of in that additional to to range each quarter and the expectation as we go out to  its going to be sort of more of the same continuing out over until we get into the middle part of the year huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 our planning assumption ken is something on the order of total beta through the cycle which would indicate were about halfway through to the prior point that i made with that being said ill tell you where were intently focused is on the day to day management of this and really very very rigorous looking client by client in the commercial portfolio geography by geography in the consumer portfolio and ensuring that we can stay competitive and ensure that weve got a strong deposit franchise and so well continue to wait and see and manage against that so if the outlook changes well let you know but at this point it continues track according to that broad expectation ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you zack zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i wanted to stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning you mentioned on slide that you expect to be at the low end of your net chargeoff range the tone very quickly changed this week from soft landing to hard landing i guess my question here is this may be obvious to us that have covered the company for a while but what makes you confident despite the deteriorating economic outlook that you could stay at the low end of that already pretty low range and given some of there was a i wouldnt call them a peer but there was a company that reported pretty eyepopping delinquency numbers in auto this morning im wondering if you could give us whats going on with auto credit trends underneath and again reremind us why you feel confident about how that portfolio would perform in an economic downturn richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey erika its rich let me take that ill go with ill answer your second question first with respect to auto so we are seeing delinquencies in our portfolio and again remember this is a prime and super prime portfolio and as we talked about at investor day weve been in this business for decades and weve got very sophisticated custom scorecards that we use in our client selection process so we feel very good about where are those businesses today and its been through numerous cycles and its proven itself that it can outperform peers from a loss content through various cycles so we feel good about that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 the delinquencies right now are right where we would expect them to be from a seasonal standpoint if you go back and you look at where delinquencies would have been in that and area were still trending below those precovid levels so we feel good there and weve been very proactive as it relates to how were managing our loan to values in that space as well so i dont have any real concerns about our indirect auto space i feel very comfortable with how that business is growing with respect to the overall comfort that we have in our net chargeoff forecast i think it goes back to our customer makeup but again as i talked about at investor day on the consumer side we are overwhelmingly a secured creditor of our loans are secured and again weve got that prime and super prime focus and high ficos of origination around so it is a very strong book and throughout all of that book i know i just talked about auto but even rvmarine and resi all of those portfolios are showing very well flows from delinquency standpoint so we feel good there on the commercial side we have taken a lot of steps to reposition this book over the last several years going through into more specialty businesses more larger companies public companies so we feel that weve mitigated the loss content in that portfolio as well so even though as zach pointed out were looking at more of a mild recession than a severe landing thats why we feel comfortable with where we are from a chargeoff forecast that low end now clearly if the economy worsens where we land within that range is going to depend on where the economy goes and how the fed reacts but at this point were comfortable with where we put that guidance stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so erika this is steve remember the guidance is through the cycle and weve been well below the through the cycle average and at this point were guiding to the lowest end of the range and weve been strategic on how we positioned the lending activities now for a dozen years weve been very disciplined rich and team along with the lending teams have adhered to the disciplines didnt open up in some of the areas indiscernible frothy and recent vintages so weve got a really good core book on both the commercial side and as a super prime and secured lender generally on the consumer side we actually think of that as a lower risk book so our aggregate moderatetolow risk profile and discipline over many years will serve us well certainly in auto and frankly the entire portfolio erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for that and my second question is on that to ppnr growth medium term target clearly you expect to hit that this year and im wondering obviously it gets more difficult if the fed is cutting which a lot of investors expect for and maybe the question is i know well hear more from you on this expense management actions that youre taking for which you will incur a restructuring charge but is that an example of the commitment that huntington has to deliver this ppnr growth range with consistency over the medium term on an annual basis even if the revenue tailwinds dissipate like rates zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc erika this is zach ill take that one and the answer to your question is yes we in terms of that very much is a sign of our trying to look ahead look at not only but also over the entirety of the strategic planning horizon and ensure that were setting up the overall financial performance in terms of revenue and the growth rate of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 overall expenses such that we can achieve the objectives in terms of profit growth that is a very deeply held objective and were not looking at short term but the long term to achieve it so as we talked about a fair amount in the investor day there are multiple strategic levers that we use to be able to manage overall expenses to grow less than revenue to support that ppnr growth even as we drive a faster growth rate of the expenses sorry the investments within expenses to drive ultimately business growth over the long term but the efficiency drivers operation accelerate that is going in reengineering major customerfacing processes taking waste and costs out of the system even if we improve productivity our long track record of optimizing the consumer and retail branch distribution network which is still very relevant still matters but does represent an opportunity over time to reduce and to harvest expense saves and things like this organizational alignment which are designed to help us to improve efficiency and hold cost growth at a low level i will note its in the guidance that ive given in terms of overall core expense growth for but importantly also helps us to achieve our strategic objectives align our organization yet even more toward our most important strategic priorities and to operate as efficiently and at pace as we can so we are extremely focused on driving that longterm efficiency program which is an important component of the ppnr guidance and i do expect well achieve the financial medium term targets this year thats whats baked into and implied by our overall guidance stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc i think erika its steve if i could add on just a bit and as youll remember from the investor day deck we shared a number of economic scenarios and when we were asked a question and commented that we would take action that the scenarios if the economy worsens and the more challenging scenario emerge weve already closed i think branches this month we are taking action consistent with our prior statement and the commitment around driving towards these mediumterm financial goals were looking ahead as well to with how were positioning the reinvestment off of the expense actions so teams doing a great job its a quick pivot if you will from a record year and record quarter but its with a very clear set of actions and plan that were executing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks for the questions erika operator the next question is from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a followup on erikas first question you guys talked about your buyback being on pause because youre watching the path of the economy in the first half you talked a little bit about the economic outlook since the investor day was slightly worse yet rich you sound pretty confident it feels like you feel good about your credit outlook just help us square that a little bit more are you actually seeing erosion maybe outside of your portfolios or help us understand your overall thinking because it seems like its pretty positive from my view richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well i would say its positive right now and were certainly cautious as we enter a downturn but everything that im looking at right now jon is holding water exactly where we thought it would be our delinquencies both in commercial and consumer are right where we would expect them to be we had a very sharp drop in our commercial delinquencies and our commercial real estate delinquencies are essentially nothing the current class npa momentum that weve got both down yearoveryear puts us in a really good stead as we enter the downturn so were looking at everything every portfolio were going deep into to make sure that were proactive in identifying potential issues and trying to get ahead of them in terms of working with customers and service potential problems but certainly the headwinds are there in the economy but we feel good about where the portfolio is positioned like i said were indiscernible we do have higher losses forecasted in than we had in so we understand thats going to be more challenging environment but we feel good where were sitting jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then can you guys touch on the one fee line that stood out was capital markets can you touch on what youre seeing there you talked about capstone and then some of your other businesses are these referrals coming to capstone internally is it business generated on their own and what do you think there in terms of the longerterm runway thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc in terms of this is zach jon ill take that one capital markets is a real bright spot for us the core underlying capital markets excluding capstone grew revenue yearoveryear in and we expect another run rate of doubledigit teens or above revenue growth as we go into so were seeing just really sustained traction and the underlying strategy there is to deepen relationships with additional clients continue to penetrate that set of services and products into our core customer base and reap the benefits of it its been an area as you know weve been investing in considerably over time and were seeing that play through into incremental revenue growth and then capstone to your point is a nice addition to that and i would tell you that capstone is doing really really well they beat the plan for  overall more than the million run rate if you look at the back half of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 revenues i think look at the back half of and we expect that to continue and sustain and just continue to grow as we go into its early days i would say in getting client referrals from the huntington base but its beginning we are seeing particularly as it relate to the pipeline and in the future a lot of positive engagement of core huntington clients with the capstone team and with the service set there and so its going to be an area that just continues to bear fruit and were quite bullish about the opportunity to grow capstones what was previously million revenue run rate up into something that continues to perform well and above that as we go forward over time so its definitely a strong point at this point richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc add to that a little bit jon if i can so capstones had a good performance thus far they had a very strong pipeline coming into the year obviously multiples have changed valuation is impacted by that timing becomes a little more uncertain but were really pleased with that the integration into the bank channels is going very very well the core businesses foreign exchange a record year institutional sales and trading commodities has had a very good performance so a number of the businesses are doing very very well at the core and expect that theyll continue to show that the laggard is as you would expect the rates businesses given the inverted curve but this is an area of strategic growth for us were continuing to invest in it and the integration of both capstone and the combined efforts of our core teams which indiscernible at the investor day make us very bullish about and beyond jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks jon operator the next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi scott huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i just wanted to ask one back on credit just sort of in light of your updated economic assumptions what sort of additional reserving needs do you think huntington might have i mean youre already starting with 190plus reserve here so i mean does that seem sufficient in light of what youre thinking or would it continue to drift upward of it richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey scott its rich ill take that so as you saw we held our coverage levels flat in the second quarter and then we had two incremental builds in  and  so the ph basis points coverage that were sitting with today we think is fully reflective of the current economic scenario now where the reserve goes from there is really going to be a function in the short term where the economy is heading right if we see significant degradation well have to react to that or if it isnt as bad well react there so its hard to answer it we go through that process every quarter in terms of looking at the economic scenario thats in front of us and what the potential for improvement and degradation is and we make the call at the end of the quarter based on all that so the near term is really going to depend on where the economy shakes out i would say that longer term as we get past the downturn however long it might be we do think that we will bring that reserve coverage down over time its just a question of the timing around that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc and then yearend reserve scott reflects this adjusted thinking in terms of the baseline economic scenario with a softened economy indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then zach sort of a ph piggyback question just the expense guidance for the full year im presuming that includes the restructuring charges to which you alluded earlier i know you said youd talk in more detail about those later but do you have maybe an approximate level of what we might expect just to get a sense for what sort of underlying expense growth might look like from here on out zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks scott for asking the question i want to take the opportunity to clarify the guidance given is to growth in underlying core and then on top of that the run rate for capstone and torana which is around million plus the fdic surcharge we estimate to be million to be relatively precise about that we have not huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 yet fully sized the potential restructuring costs from the organizational alignment actions that steve mentioned so that is yet to be included in that guidance just to put a very specific point on that and then i dont expect it to be overly large but well have to see ultimately itll be a function of a number of factors including the final nature of the changes and importantly as steve noted were instituting a voluntary retirement program which by its very name has a function of employee selection and take up on their own and so therell be some degree of variability until we have a sense of where that program lay in so that more to come on that theres a few opportunities during the first quarter for us to provide additional updates around the nature of the program the size that were on and we intend to do that as we get further out into  r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay appreciate the clarification stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc theres some pickup on that expense that onetime expense that we would expect to see just in the run rate in and then maybe other things we could do to absorb that ph also not the forecast r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you all very much operator the next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i just wanted to push on the buybacks youve got almost cet1 capital and youve got very strong reserves youve got very strong capital generation solid loan growth but not going to consume a ton of capital you seem pretty confident on credit so i guess im just trying to better understand why you wouldnt buy back stock in the first half and then just to kind of throw it out there it feels like the uncertainty might increase as we look to the back half so what would make you kind of more confidence to buy back in the second half heading into maybe more macro uncertainty zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah matt its a good question i think just take a step back broadly to frame it the expectation now is as we get out over the course of the totality of and certainly as we think about and beyond to get back to a more normal mix overall payout ratios between dividends and share repurchases and retaining capital to grow and so i think you could see this buyback is program with the repurchase program is being indicative of that part of that and i think a really healthy sign when we thought a little more tactically zooming in into the near term just really want to see the depth of the economic environment during the course of before we make any substantive or significant commitments and i think hopefully the logic of that is understood huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 how long exactly does it take to get the clarity to your point is somewhat uncertain but i suspect well know a bit more over the course of  and as we get into  if its more resolved at that point then i think wed be more active but still highly uncertain well have to see a new dynamic but generally speaking the size of the program was designed to keep us in the middle of our cet1 operating range over the course of the preceding periods and so that will be our plan to generally manage in that way ideally well get more clarity in the near term matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then as we think about potential uses of the capital besides buybacks just remind us your appetite for bolton deals and i guess specifically within fees right because we kind of step back right now in net interest income maybe its not peaking but its probably not going to be a key driver of growth as we get through this year and beyond and i know you guys have been talking about kind of better balancing some of that fee mix over time so whats the appetite to do something whether smaller or maybe bigger than you have in the past thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc matt its steve we are interested in building our fee income opportunities in that revenue stream and so if we can find things that we think makes sense that would enhance our current business lines andor what we can offer to our customers wed be interested just as the last year we were fortunate to get capstone work and a fintech payments firm called torana so well be looking as the year progresses whether it makes sense to bolster via acquisition on the fee side of our businesses but thats not sort of an intended set aside on that buyback indiscernible our capital priorities havent changed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator thank you at this time weve reached the end of the questionanswer session and i will now turn the floor back to mr steinour for closing remarks stephen d steinour chairman president chief
