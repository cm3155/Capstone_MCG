products people and digital capabilities that will drive sustainable longterm growth and outperformance turning to slide for an update on our digital and brand strategies following the completion of the firstmerit acquisition in we began the evolution of our consumer gotomarket strategy from being branchcentric to a powerful multichannel model that includes leading digital channels we introduced the hub which forms the backbone of our awardwinning mobile app and our online banking platform that evolution has accelerated this year with increased customer adoption of mobile and digital products and services and we are successfully driving digital sales and originations as well as changing and expanding the branch experience to include virtual and digitallyassisted delivery our brand sales activity is almost back to precovid levels its about today but were seeing an accelerating evolution the way our customers use branches simpler transactions are rapidly moving into faster and easier mobile and digital venues this transition is allowing our branch bankers to focus on providing more valuable advice and focusing on deepening our customer relationships all ways of looking out for our customers as weve discussed previously and as shown on the bottom of the slide huntington regularly evaluates and optimizes our branch distribution since the completion of the firstmerit acquisition in weve reduced our branch count by branches or this includes the consolidation of branches or as part of the integration the sale of branches in wisconsin and the consolidation of an additional branches or annually on average since last month we announced the planned consolidation of additional branches or in the first quarter were pleased with the high retention levels postconsolidation of deposits due to the strong foundational relationships with our customers and the close proximity to other huntington branches as weve maintained our branch share position in almost all markets this thoughtful branch network optimization strategy allows us to continue to capitalize on our competitive advantages around convenience our brand promise and customer service if you did not listen to andy harmenings presentation on our digital transformation at an investor conference in early september i encourage you to visit our investor relations website where you can listen to the replay and see the presentation materials i believe our digital strategy and our execution of that strategy is generating industryleading results we delivered very strong third quarter results including a record level of pretax preprovision earnings thanks to the continued solid execution across the bank in the face of the continued challenging operating environment im particularly pleased with our yearoveryear revenue growth as earning asset growth more than offset nim compression to drive spread revenue modestly higher while fee income growth was bolstered by the second consecutive quarter of record mortgage banking income huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 the performance of our home lending team was outstanding as they originated more than billion of mortgages for the second consecutive quarter to frame that for you our previous high watermark for any quarter was billion of mortgage originations in the fourth quarter of last year our combined mortgage production over the past two quarters was greater than we did in all of and roughly the same as in all of so these accomplishments were the direct result of the successful buildout of this team and our investments and our digital mortgage lending platform over the past several years were wellpositioned to capitalize on the current mortgage environment and the nearterm outlook remains strong given the prolonged low interest rate outlook weve implemented a comprehensive action plan to stabilize the nim near current levels over the long term zach will cover this and more in his remarks we continue to closely manage our expenses a significant portion of the yearoveryear increase in expenses resulted from restructuring cost related to implementation of expense management program we announced last quarter and elevated variable cost to support our record home lending business volumes as we previously discussed our efforts have been to manage expenses so that we can allocate investments to our strategic growth initiatives looking forward we remain optimistic of the continuing economic recovery the unprecedented level of government stimulus has supported both individuals and many companies and were very pleased with the number of customers exiting forbearance arrangements our consumer lending businesses which as youve seen in our quarterly origination statement provided for over a decade are focused on super prime customers and theyre performing very well mortgage auto and rvmarine are all continuing to post strong originations commercial lending has been restrained by the economic uncertainty with many customers shepherding elevated levels of liquidity paying down revolvers and putting off new investment spending we continue to see improvement in commercial pipelines that we mentioned last quarter and based on the conversations weve had with our customers we expect these levels of elevated liquidity to persist for some time were cautiously optimistic that ci loan growth will improve later this year and early next year the timing of forgiveness around the ppp loans remains uncertain but i would like to take a moment to share that huntington is the nations largest sba 7a lender for the third consecutive year in the sbas fiscal year ended september were the largest 7a lender in our footprint for the 12th year in a row small businesses are such a vital component of our economy and the nascent economic recovery as they consistently account for the lions share of jobs created in our country particularly in this pandemic these businesses deserve and need our support and i hope these businesses are the focus of any future government stimulus package our third quarter credit metrics reflect stable to improving trends across most portfolios and include elevated chargeoffs from the sale of more oil and gas loans during the quarter many customers successfully exited prior pandemicrelated deferral programs the underlying portfolio metrics reflect our continued expectation for outperformance through the cycle our credit loss reserves take into consideration the economic uncertainty that we continue to have the virus both in duration and severity we believe were adequately covered should the pandemic continue to prolong the economic recovery our capital ratios remain within our targeted ranges this morning we announced that the board declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share unchanged from the prior quarter were currently huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 finalizing our submission for the offcycle ccar we are seeking approval and expect to increase our capital return to shareholders in in closing im encouraged by the momentum i can see building across our businesses our colleagues are actively engaging with our customers and prospects customer activity is improving month by month we see improved debit card activity sales activity in the branches is almost back to precovid levels and our pipeline has been replenished in many of our businesses over the past several months we recently made some key additions to our commercial team notably within our asset finance capital markets and corporate banking teams and have conversations ongoing with additional revenue producers were receiving very very positive feedback and early results from the new 24hour grace for business and the safety zone product features for consumers and businesses that we rolled out in september our credit quality through the early months of this pandemic has held up well and were confident in the quality of our loan portfolios im conscious that the economic outlook remains somewhat uncertain in the near term but overall i like what i see and im optimistic about our outlook over time now let me turn it over to zach for an overview of financial performance zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides the financial highlights for the third quarter we reported earnings per common share of return on average assets was and return on average tangible common equity was results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added million to the reserve during the quarter now lets turn to slide to review our results in more detail yearoveryear pretax preprovision earnings growth was we believe this is a solid performance in light of the current interest rate environment and uncertain economic outlook total revenue increased versus the yearago quarter due to strong fee income growth paired with modest spread revenue growth as steve mentioned earlier home lending was a particular bright spot this quarter driving a record million of mortgage banking income we also saw deposit service charges and card and payment processing revenues rebound off of the lows as customer activity continue to rebound and pandemicrelated fee waiver programs expired i should also note that deposit service charges remained below the yearago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line total expenses were higher by million or from the yearago quarter as steve mentioned approximately percentage points of this growth or million was driven by restructuring costs from our expense management program another percentage points or million was related to yearoveryear increases in commissions overtime contract help and other variable costs in our home lending business driven by the record level of mortgage originations the balance of the expense growth approximately reflected a sustained level of investment in our strategic priorities including digital and mobile technologies turning now to slide fte net interest income increased as earning asset growth more than offset year overyear nim impression on a linkedquarter basis the net interest margin increased basis points to as shown in the log on the right side of the slide the linkedquarter increase included a 7basispoint benefit from our hedging program including the full quarter impact of the billion of forward starting asset hedges that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 became active in the second quarter there was also a 2basispoint benefit during the third quarter related to changes in balance sheet mix and other items these two positive impacts were partially offset by the elevated balance sheet liquidity that contributed a 7basispoint incremental headwind in the third quarter as steve mentioned were taking decisive actions to maintain the net interest margin near current levels while we are diligently working across the organization to identify and pull levers to manage the margin its important to note that our core optimization objective is revenue growth with the highest possible return on capital within our risk appetite that said nim is one of the key drivers of that return and revenue growth so were actively managing various levers to stabilize the nim as a key component in that calculus we expect to continue to optimize our funding costs including further reductions to deposit costs and optimizing our wholesale funding on the earning asset side were currently in the midst of a broad reexamination of all business and lending commercial relationships for repricing opportunities that i believe will yield several basis points of incremental nim over time as well as associated deepening of noninterest income fee opportunities similarly we are optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing loan production in certain higher yielding asset classes such as small business residential mortgage assetbacked lending equipment leasing while deemphasizing growth in some of our thinner priced lending products finally our comprehensive hedging strategies continue to provide some relief from the yield curve as we expect they will continue to do for the next several years while this hedging benefit will begin to gradually wane over the next several years there are no looming cliffs as we have strategically built a wellladdered hedging portfolio moving to slide average earning assets increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter driven by the billion of ppp loans and a billion increase in deposits at the fed average commercial and industrial loans increased from the yearago quarter primarily reflecting the ppp loans during the quarter ci benefited from a full quarters impact of the ppp loans however downward pressure on the business and commercial utilization rates especially within dealer floor plan more than offset this resulting in a modest linkedquarter decline consumer lending has also been a bright spot this year as indirect auto residential mortgage and our rvmarine portfolios have posted steady growth a trend we expect to persist in coming quarters turning to slide we will review the deposit growth average core deposits increased yearonyear and sequentially these increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to the ppp loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn consumer growth largely related to the governments stimulus and increased consumer and business banking account production and reduced account attrition like the industry as a whole this very strong core deposit growth of the past several quarters has resulted in significantly elevated levels of deposits at the federal reserve bank these elevated levels of liquidity have proven to be much stickier than we anticipated and our revised outlook is that they are likely to persist for several quarters before these customers deploy the funds while this did pressure the  nim more than originally expected it is also providing us the opportunity to more aggressively manage down our deposit costs going forward slide highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans total deposits salable mortgage originations and debit card spend as these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity amongst our customers and huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 you can see on the topleft chart the decline in commercial loan balances excluding ppp loans leveledoff in july and remained relatively flat during the third quarter early stage pipelines are refilling providing room for optimism of a return to new commercial loan growth later this year and into next year we expect this coupled with the expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates and the typical seasonal build in dealer floor plan will provide some offset for the headwinds from ppp loans as they are forgiven and repaid over the next several quarters the topright chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors ive mentioned previously providing attractive source of liquidity during these uncertain times the bottom two charts relate to customer activity driving two of the four key fee income lines for us mortgage banking salable originations remain robust although there has been a very slow decline since the peak in june as we mentioned on the second quarter call debit card usage quickly rebounded once the economy began to reopen and we continue to see healthy yearoveryear increases in both transactions and dollar spend slide illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios the common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended the quarter at relatively stable with last quarter the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at again in line with last quarter both ratios remain within our operating guidelines and our strong capital levels position us well to execute on growth initiatives and investment opportunities let me now turn it over to rich pohle to cover credit rich richard a pohle chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks zach id first like to reinforce the steps weve taken over the last several years to position us for this downturn in commercial we scaled back leverage lending healthcare construction and commercial real estate we stopped originating oil and gas loans about months ago and have reduced that portfolio to well under of total loans we have also repositioned our business banking portfolio with a significant reduction in commercial real estate exposure and a shift toward sba as about of our loans are now sba as opposed to only about heading into the last downturn we were the number one bank in the entire country last year for sba 7a originations for the third consecutive year on the consumer side we have continued our focus on prime and super prime profile customers and leveraged our expertise in auto into our rvmarine business turning now to the credit results and metrics slide provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or acl from yearend to the third quarter you can see our acl now represents of loans and excluding the ppp loan balances our acl would be as of september the third quarter allowance represents a modest million reserve build from the second quarter like the previous quarters in there are multiple data points used besides the provision expense for  the primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the august baseline forecast this scenario was somewhat improved from the may baseline forecast we used in  and assumes elevated unemployment through ending the year at followed by a slower paced economic recovery through the first half of that accelerates as the year progresses gdp ends the full year down and demonstrates growth for all of with that growth also accelerating in the back half of the year while a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 improved as have our credit metrics for the quarter there are still many uncertainties to deal with a likely covid resurgence in the winter a stalemate on additional economic stimulus the impact of the upcoming election as well as ongoing model imperfections relating to the covid economic forecasting we believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the second quarter is prudent when considering these factors slide shows our npas and tdrs and demonstrates the continued impact of our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of npas oil and gas npas at  represented of our overall npas which were down from the second quarter by million or as we proactively reduced the oil and gas portfolio and were able to return other credits to accruing status slide provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided on our commercial customers as we forecasted on our  call the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now totaled just million down from billion at june about of the remaining deferrals represents second 90day deferrals that are centered on hospitality retail and travel related customers over of the remaining deferrals expire this month and we expect to have limited commercial deferral balances at the end of  some sba customers might seek an initial deferral in  following the end of the sixmonth payment support the sba provided under the cares act commercial delinquencies are within a normal range at basis points reinforcing the deferrals have not negatively impacted credit quality slide shows our consumer deferrals and the news here is good as well our auto rvmarine and heloc portfolios are performing as we would have expected with very modest postdeferral delinquencies in fact nearly all the auto rvmarine and heloc deferrals have lapsed and we are operating in a precovid risk management environment with respect to those portfolios the mortgage accommodations have come down since june and are also meeting our expectations request for second deferrals or further modifications equal just of the postdeferral population today mortgage deferrals will remain elevated for the next quarter or so given the longer initial deferral period days in many cases versus for other loans as well as the more formal deferral exit process which requires a second round of documentation with less signatures and notaries like the commercial deferrals the consumer deferrals are not indicating additional credit risk at this time consumer delinquencies were down across all loan categories on a yearoveryear basis slide provides an update to the industries hardest hit by covid19 we continue regular reviews of our commercial loan portfolio and we believe we have the risks identified and appropriately managed any adverse covid impacts as well as the most recent snc exam results are reflected in our critclass and other credit metrics for the quarter as we have previously mentioned our hotel exposure is centered on five primary sponsors with most of whom we have enjoyed longterm relationships including through the last downturn these sponsors continue to demonstrate the financial strength to see their way through the longerterm recovery period we forecast for this industry our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick service brands we believe this book to be in very good shape overall but well continue to closely monitor the heightened risk in the single location and other nonfranchise names in the portfolio there are currently no material credit concerns in the other high impact portfolios and you can see that the credit metrics since june are relatively stable recall in the second quarter as part of our active portfolio management process we evaluated the covid19 related impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 downgrade those severely impacted credits to criticize status this review resulted in a significant increase to our criticized asset level in  i am pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over million or in the third quarter validating that the portfolio review we undertook in  was comprehensive and served to identify potential problems early working with our customers we were able to proactively remedy a number of these loans slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter our credit performance overall was strong net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases the commercial chargeoffs were again centered in the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately of the total commercial net chargeoffs like  nearly all these oil and gas chargeoffs resulted from million of loan sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as weve prudently reduced our exposure to this industry annualized net chargeoffs excluding the oil and gas related losses were basis points demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in  consumer chargeoffs were just basis points in  highlighting our strong consumer portfolio our super prime originations of auto and rvmarine loans in particular continue to perform at very high levels i would also add our nonperforming asset ratio decreased basis points linkedquarter to basis points as always weve provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides let me turn it back over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you rich as steve alluded to earlier we have confidence in our businesses and are cautiously optimistic that the economic recovery will continue particularly longer term as we move past the election and with a potential for vaccine and improved therapeutic medical treatments for the virus we also expect to finish out strong and slide provides our expectations for the fullyear looking at the average balance sheet for the fullyear we expect average loans and average deposits to increase approximately and respectively compared to last year for the remainder of the year we expect consumer loans more specifically residential mortgage auto rvmarine to be the primary driver of average loan growth as commercial loan growth remains muted our current projections assume the majority of ppp balances will remain on balance sheet through the end of the year with respect to deposits we expect continued growth in consumer core deposits from new customer acquisition relationship deepening and low attrition as i mentioned earlier we expect the elevated level of business and commercial deposits to persist through yearend we expect to record fullyear total revenue growth of approximately to and fullyear total expense growth of to with respect to revenues we expect  revenues to be in line with  up to yearoveryear we expect fullyear nim to be approximately basis points and we expect a flat to moderately higher nim in the fourth quarter driven primarily by further reductions to the cost of interestbearing deposits which we expect to be below our prior historic low of basis points that we set back in the third quarter of this guidance includes no positive impact in  from the acceleration of ppp fees and includes a continuation of elevated liquidity that we discussed earlier we expect fullyear noninterest income growth of to primarily huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 driven by robust mortgage income while our fourth quarter outlook includes moderation in mortgage banking we expect an uptick in capital markets fees as well as several other fee lines to help to cushion that decline on expenses we expect the fourth quarter to be up to from the third quarter as weve discussed before we believe the current economic outlook presents the opportunity to invest in our businesses meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term as the recovery continues to solidify as such were accelerating investments in technology and other key strategic initiatives across our businesses as we exit while delivering fullyear positive operating leverage for the eighth consecutive year finally our credit remains fundamentally sound we expect fullyear net chargeoffs to be approximately to basis points this is reflective of the cleanup of the oil and gas portfolio as well as the broader economic conditions now let me turn it back over to mark so we can get to your questions mark muth directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc operator well now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i appreciate hey i think you guys actually answered a lot of my questions on the sort of the potential for commercial to kind of resume some growth i certainly appreciate that i wanted to ask specifically on the dealer business thats been kind of a headwind and granted its not necessarily huge for you guys but was just curious to hear about your thoughts on sort of any window i guess to how quickly we should expect that dealer business in particular to recover in other words how much of a growth driver can it end up being richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 hey scott its rich ill take that weve seen really low utilization rates across the dealer floor plan portfolio what has been typically in the range are now down below the challenge with that business is just getting inventory back on the lots and while the oems are ramping up deliveries to the dealers new car levels are continuing at pretty low levels so we would expect that we will see a steady build from that up towards the end of the year and provide a gradual build over the year this isnt something thats going to ramp up very quickly but it is going to be something that we see steady state and slowly building throughout the balance of and into r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then zach just on the guidance for the full year and i guess implicit in the fourth quarter if im doing the math correctly i think the implied nii in the fourth quarter would be up fairly significantly from the third quarter it sounds like margin is sort of flattish i guess just what are the puts and takes that you see for nii in particular in the fourth quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure thanks again for the question so i think our outlook for loans sequentially is up in total about or million and we are expecting our kind of baseline underlying forecast as a couple basis points of incremental nim as we go into  and so thats really going to drive spread revenues up sort of around million to be clear it does not include any ppp acceleration there could be some revenues coming through from that but were not banking on that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and its none baked in so that was the followon so all right terrific thank you very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for either rich or zach on the provision can you talk about some of the provision drivers for the quarter and what you want the overall message to be as we look forward on that it seems like some of this was growth driven as well but can you just talk about provision drivers and expectations richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure jon its rich ill start with that yeah as you pointed out we did have a relatively modest reserve build in  it was about from  the coverage ratio moved up basis points from basis points to basis points i would first point out that we did have over billion in pointtopoint loan growth in  which accounted for about of that reserve build clearly with cecl you are taking a life of loan approach to any portfolio build that you have but i would tie the build really to ongoing uncertainty with respect to both the virus and the type of stimulus if any thats coming our way we are seeing covid19 cases increasing across much of our footprint and while we dont expect a return to full stayathome orders we do believe that that is going to be a drag on the economy going forward and with respect to stimulus we can see that theres a deadlock right now and the timing and the makeup of what that stimulus ends up looking like is going to be important to the recovery i think you have to keep in mind too that all of the economic scenarios have assumptions with respect to both the dollar amount and the timing of stimulus and to the extent that that stimulus is delayed or isnt earmarked for where the model thinks its going is going to have also an impact so when we look at factoring all of that in the uncertainty thats what really drove us to keep the reserve about where it was i think basis points is pretty much a plateau for the quarter those were the big drivers jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc but the message i hear is adequately reserved for what you see today ive heard that a couple of times is that fair richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes thats absolutely jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one small one its a noise in your numbers at this point but quarter your nonperforming about half the chargeoffs were oil and gas zach you used the term cleanup whats left there and whats kind of the timing on that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah we have hedge we sold million in the third quarter weve got that portfolio down from where it was a year ago when we talk about cleanup the book right now is at a point where with the reserves that we have we will be opportunistic sellers i think over the course of the last several quarters there was more of a huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 desire to get the overall numbers down and the pricing that we were able to get allowed us to do that within the coverage ratio that we had i dont believe in the fourth quarter that were going to be aggressive sellers we will certainly look to sell it if it makes sense and to the extent that the borrowing base redeterminations require additional chargeoffs well take them so were going to move into what i will consider more of a traditional problem loan management scenario with oil and gas going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from line of erika najarian with bank of america please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning erica erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc steve my first question is for you out of all your dfast participant peers i think this is probably the first statement weve heard in terms of expectations to increase capital return in assuming restrictions dont stretch out for too long and knowing the bank youve always prioritized dividend dividend growth and also of course funding your growth and im wondering if that balance shifts a little bit to buybacks in given where your stock is relative to your return potential stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you erika we do have a relatively high dividend yield compared to the peer group and that will influence at the appropriate time i believe our boards decisions we would be more oriented towards buyback versus a dividend increase but no decision were not at that threshold yet but the historic guidance we would have provided will substitute will likely substitute other uses of capital as a second alternative and that dividend is balanced with that historically wed have said core growth dividend and other uses youll see a much more balanced approach certainly with the stock trading at these levels that seems to make a lot of sense to us again subject to fed and other regulatory support huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and my second question is for zach i think of course there was some chatter about swap income potentially rolling off and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there are no looming cliffs and if im doing a back of the envelope math right the derivative book helped net interest income about maybe million to million this quarter and course correct me if im wrong and im wondering as we think about the outlook for in your wellladdered strategy what is the dollar impact from the derivative portfolio if you could confirm for this quarter and what you expect it to be for zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah probably the dollar indiscernible basis points in for the full year the derivative portfolio is benefiting us by about basis points next year we expect that to rise somewhat several basis points up to basis points and then it sort of gradually runs off through and i think its about basis points to basis points run off is about basis point run off and the is actually flat so theres no massive cliff theres clearly a drop and a gradual reduction over time but as i also mentioned in my prepared remarks were pulling all the levers of balance sheet optimization to really offset and drive that and we do have confidence well floor that in near term levels over the long term leveraging the three key strategies funding optimization asset growth mix and that customer level pricing lastly ill say just pull back and see if that answers your question is for next year there will likely be a fair amount of quartertoquarter volatility driven by ppp loan forgiveness acceleration well see but we suspect that that will be in the first couple of quarters erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc no that was very helpful and clear thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc following up on the expense side zach you mentioned to expense growth in the fourth quarter and i think you said it was mostly investment just wondering can you help us just to understand what were the restructuring cost that were in the third quarter number and also what youre expecting in the fourth quarter number huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure in the third quarter we had million of restructuring costs in the fourth we expect that to be kind of around or just less than million so the incremental million benefits quartertoquarter within that to expense guide i would tell you just pulling back that really the investments are essentially entirely driven by that investment growth so the expenses are essentially driven by that investment growth we see a little bit of continued quartertoquarter growth in variable cost is driven by customer activity continuing to rebound out of the covid lows but those are the main drivers ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then so if i take that then theres not much restructuring costs in that fourth quarter number is that kind of the right base to grow off of or is this more of a onetime stepup that just gets stuff accelerated or in relative to what youd expect to spend as you go forward to your prior comments last quarter about the flexibility within the cost save numbers zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a good question but its a little too early for us to give you kind of a longerterm outlook well do that more fulsomely in the next quarter update when we talk in january but i think that what youre going to see is this elevated level of investments continuing for a few more quarters you cant turn on a dime with this kind of stuff so were going were ramping up toward the end of this year as weve talked about over time to capture the opportunities that we think are present in the recovery and thatll sustain for a few more quarters but the key for us is really these things drive revenue growth we have very focused investment plan very tied to our strategic growth initiatives and the expectation is well start to see the benefits of that flowing through into accelerating revenue growth as we go throughout and certainly into ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just one underneath that whats also i think steve mentioned a bunch of this in his prepared remarks but like how do you go forward and help offset some of that natural inflation from the spending in terms of things you can either see starting to become more efficient in or as steve mentioned earlier youd start to rethink some of the branch locations over time et cetera zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah i mean you sort of ticked out our hit list there and i think the investments that weve got some of which drive kind of shorter term and more productivity related benefits others are longer term and customer acquisition and customer relationship deepening related and behind the scenes were just continuing to be incredibly rigorous with our noninvestment expense program and i think the way i look at expenses is is youve got growth investments and we maniacally drive the return out of that and youve got the rest of the business expenses that we just squeeze perpetually lower so the items that we look at are a lot of what youve just said huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks a lot zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of david george with baird please proceed with your question david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning i had a question just moving to the fee side of things there was a good rebound this quarter in deposit service charges and just kind of curious how youre thinking about that line item in  and then kind of a run rate starting in obviously given the amount of liquidity thats in consumer checking accounts thats going to put a damper on it but i would imagine that the spend has gotten better so thats obviously driving some of the improvements so curious how youre thinking about that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that and perhaps others may want to weigh in as well so we did see a bit of a snapback in personal service charges in  about million higher although it was continues to run a fair amount lower than last year and as we look forward into the future i dont expect a lot of growth in that line i think that the particularly the elevated levels of deposits that weve seen i for one believe that theyre going to be quite sticky for some time and i guess fundamentally related peoples uncertainty about the economy and therefore just protecting themselves with ample liquidity and weve seen kind of a flight to quality and flight to proximity from our customers and leveraging huntington as a place to hold those deposits so i think thats going to hold personal service charges lower for a while its really not our focus for growth were really driving the valueadded fee lines over time david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc makes sense i appreciate it zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 great thanks i guess one stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning so one of your peers decided to recently exit indirect auto can you just talk about the economics of that business and how the economics has changed since the beginning of the pandemic richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc ken this is rich ill take a stab at that we love the indirect auto business i mean this is a foundation and a core competency that weve had for several years now and we would grow this business as opposed to exit it the credit quality performs incredibly well through dfast its one of our bestperforming portfolios i think if you look at the recent deferral activity that weve had in this book and the post deferral delinquencies theyre excellent and right in line with that so from a credit standpoint we couldnt be happier with the performance of this portfolio over time and were very enthusiastic about the growth of this business over time so we have contrarian approach and i think its based on the fact that weve got great dealer relationships weve built up over the years and that has proven out very well so zach do you want to touch on zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc ill just touch on ill just tack on and i think i totally agree with everything rich has said this business has incredible risk adjusted returns to give you a sense of the yields were seeing right now our new volume coming in are so thats sort of constructive and helpful for the nim trajectory its also relatively short lived assets so it helps us continue to play as rates potentially move higher over the longer term and lastly i would say is just its great to see these business lines that huntington has that are weve got such a diversification of the business lines weve got that when something else is weak like commercial that we talked about this other one has been really a real source of strength and growth for us so yeah couldnt say enough about how much we like it ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and then just the second question you guys talked about seeing growth in commercial later this year i think you referenced it a few times just to be clear is this specifically a huntingtonspecificlike issue that youre growing ci or is this or do you envision the broader industry also growing ci off a low base zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc we havent were not in a position to comment on the industry but were looking at our pipeline what were making and sharing that comment ken we have a pipeline today thats comparable to last year and in both huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 business banking and our commercial banking teams and typically fourth quarter is one of our best quarters yearinyearout i would expect based on the weighting of that pipeline probability of closing to have pretty good fourth quarter and all indications are positive what were hearing from customers is a continuing recovery remember the midwest is recovering nicely particularly the manufacturing sector the biggest issue we hear in that regard is they just cant get enough employees our indiscernible numbers for the midwest are higher than any other region of the country so this is a labor issue thats constraining some of the potential on the investment side and maybe holding back some of the loan demand so were actually reasonably bullish about our fourth quarter and beyond ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just back on the loan growth topic on the commercial side i appreciate the color you just gave in terms of in your markets and some of the trends outside of dealer services from an industry perspective where are you seeing the improving growth dynamics is it manufacturing like you just said is that where youre starting to see demand or is that youre just optimistic of that materializing are there other portfolios where you are seeing some momentum begin stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc were clearly seeing at the manufacturing sector john as i mentioned but its more broadly based there is a level of business activity thats occurring on the buyout side on the generational transfers beyond that theres activity that were remember were a principally a lower middle market bank in the commercial side and as inventories are getting replenished and revenues rebuilt theres working capital demand we do a lot of equipment finance and assetbased lending as well youve seen particularly on the assetbased side good demand fourth quarter is generally good for equipment finance our healthcare activity is very very strong as well so its broadbased huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i will just tack on this is zach as an indication of that the pipelines are up to almost the level of last year just to give you a sense off of considerably lower including during covid19 and production during the quarter or during  ramped quite substantially john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah got it no thats helpful thanks for that added color there and then on the credit side just to confirm did you indicate that your criticized assets are down did you say in the quarter and also can you just talk about what areas that you saw improvement and if you think that decline to continue or do you think theres going to be some pressure to the upside as some of the pressure on borrowers as they come off of forbearance and uncertainty on stimulus weighs in zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah was right it was about million was the reduction over the quarter it was very widespread we did have the oil and gas sales which was about million or million all of that just about all of that was criticized but beyond that it was very broadbased across just about all of our lines of business which was heartening to see we did do that very comprehensive review in the second quarter which caused the spike in crit in  and so seeing it come down in  we expected that to some extent and i would say that we will continue to see a downward trend in criticized it may be a bit bumpy quarterto quarter things will move in and things will move out within different portfolios i think thats just the kind of the covid19 environment that were dealing and things are going to popup that might be somewhat unexpected but i would generally expect our credit quality to begin migrating the critclass to migrating down over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thats helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thank you good morning rich zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 following up on your auto segment comments it looks like you guys had recently been seeing a growing mix of used car originations but we saw a mix shift back to new this quarter i think that was on slide can you discuss some of the dynamics there and give us a sense of the relative profitability of new versus used just at a high level zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think this is zach ill start off and i dont know maybe mark you just may want to tack on the yield number is right in front of me but i think generally this is really influenced by the supply dynamics that rich was talking about earlier so earlier in the year when the supply interruptions we had on the original equipment side just demand naturally shifted to the used side and so we saw that mix change and i think what youre seeing now is a gradual normalization back to a kind of a longerterm typical mix of new versus used cars the yield on used is a bit higher than new but i dont have the numbers right in front of me to comment more specifically mark muth a directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc yeah bill i dont have the specific breakout on the yields between new and used but used is always quite a bit higher than new and so on a risk adjusted return basis its actually slightly better than the new bill carcache q analyst wolfe research okay thanks guys and then separately zach on your comments around mix optimization and remixing more towards small business in particular can you discuss how you guys are thinking about growing into that from a relationship from a customer relationship standpoint timing credit risk perspective particularly with all the uncertainty around stimulus zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah ill touch on that a little bit and rich may want to tack on as well richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc absolutely zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i think the list of assets we would like to grow faster includes small business but its not certainly exclusive to that as we noted a lot of others but i think what were seeing our strategy is to really deepen the penetration and provide terrific products and experiences to this segment particularly through the digital investments were making and were really seeing it work theres a tremendous demand coming through i think partly leveraging the real success we had with ppp and so its pretty broadbased i dont know rich if you want to tack on in terms how were thinking about richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 no absolutely the ppp success that we had is certainly a driver of the growth and we are really focused on sba within small business as a continued lever for growth we obviously have a core competency in sba well continue to leverage that going forward but also on the conventional side of business banking which is the non sba piece of it weve seen very good growth as well and thats been pretty widespread across industries healthcare and others bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thanks rich if i could squeeze one last one in for steve you guys have done a lot to improve the hbans rotce profile since the great recession can you discuss your expectations for the kind of rotce generation that we can expect from hban to the extent that serp were to persist for an extended period stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well we havent changed our longterm metrics on rotce at this point well be out as zach mentioned with an outlook for next year in january so i think thats fair to use based on the work that weve done looking forward over the next couple of years as a rough guideline now operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee on for steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning janet janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning my first question is on margin obviously lots of moving pieces there but if i put it all together with excess liquidity remaining elevated nearterm and success of repricing looking into is the direction of nim modest downward trend from here or do you think you can manage it more stable given hedges benefit zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah good question thank you this is zach ill take that one so i think will likely land around basis points from just a tick higher and our expectation for excluding ppp for a second is just a few ticks higher than that so about flat and my baseline outlook is a few basis points higher well have i think i mentioned earlier kind of the next few years hedge benefits in basis points this year was basis points next year is basis points indiscernible forecast thats about basis points better interest bearing liabilities i expect to be down also kind of over around or over basis points we do expect yield pressure largely offsetting that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 so thats the sort of flat to a few basis points higher outlook ive got for at this point again well clearly do a fair amount of work around this and well come back with more clear guidance later there are wildcards and its the ppp timing that i mentioned theres potentially also some we continue to look at hedging in the portfolio and that could also throw a few basis points volatility in there but generally thats my outlook janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats very helpful and my next question is on operating leverage so when we combined with expense savings from the branch consolidations and i guess more bullish outlook on loans going into do you see it increasingly likely that huntington can achieve positive operating leverage in again zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no its really too early for us to talk about the totality of the full year of i do expect a lot of the trends that were seeing right now to kind of continue for the next few quarters just giving the momentum and the trends the businesses that were seeing right now and so well see well come back and talk more about that our commitment around positive operating leverage is a longterm one and we think its the right one for the company but were really focused on making the investments now to drive revenue acceleration and id tell you we feel pretty good about it so well come back and talk more in a few months stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc this is steve were bullish about coming out of this cycle and taking advantage of it that has been our orientation in the past and were continuing with that so well be looking to drive growth revenue growth and youre getting a sense of that off of third quarter earnings janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi brock huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey just in terms of lost content and the cadence of net chargeoffs going forward one i guess how are you feeling about lost content now versus say april im assuming thats better but i wanted to ask and then two as you look at chargeoffs and theyve been relatively stable here is there a bit of a catch up in other words an increase from here that we should continue to be aware of or are you anticipating that we can kind of hold at this more at this level stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc brock this is steve just to your april comments indiscernible different right think about the volatility uncertainty in that period of time versus today so you should be inferring that off the comments about the economy and the recovery et cetera and that would be true with an expectation that credit quality will mirror the economic recovery theres still uncertainty and as rich said it may be lumpy but we dont have a catchup quarter weve already caught up so were in good shape as of the end of the third quarter given the volatility and expect that the team will manage with consistency as we go forward maybe a little lumpy because of the recovery and the nature of it the virus but like the footing we have very much brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay the mix optimization could you look to move some of those fed deposits into investment securities or is that not something youre looking at zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so this is zach its really not something were looking at at this time we do expect to begin to reinvest our securities cash flows this quarter as weve talked about a little bit over the last few calls and to get back in the securities portfolio to around  levels so thats about billion billion of incremental securities investments in the fourth quarter but not really with a mind toward utilizing those deposits rather were focused on deploying those for core organic growth and to some degree as a funding optimization opportunity that i mentioned earlier so thats the plan brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for the color zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the floor back to mr steinour for closing comments huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript
