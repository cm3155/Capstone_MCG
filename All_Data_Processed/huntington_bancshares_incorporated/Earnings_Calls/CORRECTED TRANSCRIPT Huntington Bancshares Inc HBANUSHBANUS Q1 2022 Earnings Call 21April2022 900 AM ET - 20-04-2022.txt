wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our first quarter results we reported earnings per common share of adjusted for notable items earnings per common share were return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was we were pleased to see accelerated momentum in our loan balances with total loans increasing by billion and excluding ppp loans increased by billion total average and ending deposits also increased driven by strong trends in both consumer and commercial balances preprovision net revenue grew from last quarter reflecting our continued focus on selffunding revenue producing strategic initiatives as well as net interest income expansion consistent with our plan we reduced core expenses by million from last quarter driven by the realization of cost synergies credit quality was exceptional with record low net chargeoffs of basis points and non performing assets reduced to basis points turning to slide accelerated loan growth momentum continued with average loan balances increasing quarteroverquarter totaling billion excluding ppp total loan balances increased billion or largely driven by commercial loans within commercial excluding ppp average loans increased by billion or from the prior quarter we continue to see broadbased demand across lending categories that is supporting strong new production we are also benefiting from slowing prepayments and modest increases in line utilization middle market asset finance corporate and specialty banking all contributed to higher net balances within commercial and have all expanded for two quarters in a row commercial real estate balances also increased during the quarter by million inventory finance contributed to growth this quarter with balances increasing by million driven by the expansion of client relationships and the expected seasonal increase in utilization levels auto dealer floorplan increased with balances up by million as new client relationships and a modest uptick in utilization both supported growth in consumer we had a record first quarter performance in indirect auto and rvmarine originations this drove balances higher in auto and rvmarine by million and million respectively additionally onsheet residential mortgage increased by million these were offset by lower home equity balances huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 across the enterprise our bankers are executing disciplined calling strategies driving sustained growth in both early stage and late stage loan pipelines both of which are higher from the prior quarter and the prior year we are seeing strong demand from our customers and the realization of pipelines supports our high degree of confidence in our outlook turning to slide we delivered solid deposit growth with balances higher by million on a spot basis total deposit balances increased billion or from prior quarter ending commercial balances increased by billion and consumer balances increased by billion from the prior quarter this growth reflects continued consumer deposit gathering and our focused relationship deepening within commercial customers on slide we reported net interest income and nim expansion core net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion increased by to billion consistent with our prior guidance net interest margin increased versus prior quarter and we are on track for further nim expansion throughout turning to slide we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to remain asset sensitive and capture the benefit of expected higher rates while incrementally providing downside protection as opportunities present themselves we have a peer leading nim and were positioned to expand margin as rates increase during the quarter we modestly increased our downside protection by executing a net billion of received fixed swaps as noted on the slide these explicit hedging actions reduced asset sensitivity in the quarter by the overall estimated asset sensitivity and an up basis point ramp scenario ended the quarter at down from at year end the remaining change in this metric beyond our hedging actions was driven by other ancillary modelling impacts such as the denominator impact of higher projected base net interest income slower prepayments and other balance sheet mix shifts on the bottom of the slide is our loan portfolio composition as you can see we are wellpositioned for the expected higher interest rates throughout the year with an attractive mix of floating and fixed rate loans furthermore our indirect auto portfolio has a weighted average life of approximately months with roughly half of that portfolio repricing each year moving to slide noninterest income was million up million yearoveryear and down million from last quarter fee revenues were impacted by a decline in mortgage banking primarily due to lower salable originations as well as typical seasonality resulting in lower cards and payments activities compared to the fourth quarter given our robust sba pipelines and attractive market opportunity we reinitiated our sba loan sales in the quarter driving a million increase in addition our record first quarter performance and wealth management sales contributed to an increase in investment related revenues overall we continue to be pleased with the traction and growth outlooks for our key fee generating businesses within payments capital markets and wealth and advisory moving on to slide noninterest expense declined million from the prior quarter and excluding notable items core expenses declined by million to billion as we delivered cost savings from the acquisition as we shared previously we expect core expenses to be approximately billion by the second quarter even as were driving down expenses were also investing in initiatives that are driving sustainable revenue growth throughout the company huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 slide highlights our capital position common equity tier was at quarter end our dividend yield remains at the top of our peer group at we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to our announced signing of a definitive agreement to acquire capstone as you can see on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were a record low of basis points benefiting from a net recovery position in commercial portfolios and continued strong consumer credit quality nonperforming assets and criticized loans both declined from the previous quarter our ending allowance for credit losses represented of total loans down from the prior quarter end slide covers our mediumterm financial targets which remain unchanged as steve mentioned were fully committed to achieving these by the second half of as our loan growth momentum continues our first capital priority remains funding this organic growth and we are encouraged by these trends to the extent that our loan growth remains as robust as we expect i would anticipate share buybacks will be de minimis for the remainder of the year we are comfortable operating at or around these current capital levels as we balance our expected growth plans and the possible longerterm scenarios for the global macroeconomic outlook as we head into finally turning to slide let me share our updated outlook the guidance we provided in january assume continued economic expansion aligned to market consensus as well as the interest rate yield curve expectations as of early january our updated guidance continues to assume further economic growth and the rate curve as of the end of march as a result of the rate curve outlook we are revising upward our guidance in net interest income we now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion to grow in the mid tohigh teens this is higher than our previous guidance of high singledigit to low doubledigits growth in fee income while we are seeing encouraging trends in our payments capital markets and wealth and advisory businesses we are also impacted by the industrywide mortgage banking pressure based on this we have revised lower our fee guidance to flat to down lowsingle digits excluding the impact of capstone on the topic of capstone we are anticipating closing the acquisition at the end of this quarter based on estimates created during due diligence we believe the business could add approximately million to million of fee income on a quarterly basis this would be incremental to the standalone  huntington guidance we will provide further information on the impacts of capstone as we complete the acquisition and finalize our financial forecasts on expenses excluding notable items we are still tracking to our billion run rate for this quarter and again this guidance is excluding capstone finally given our continued exceptional credit performance across our portfolios we are revising our fullyear net chargeoffs down to approximately basis points from less than basis points previously now let me pass it back to steve for a couple of closing comments before we open for qa stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zach slide recaps what we believe is a compelling opportunity huntington stands as a powerful top ten regional bank with scale and leading market density as well as a compelling set of capabilities both in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 footprint and nationally we are focused on executing our strategic plan which we believe will drive substantial value creation for our shareholders we are wellpositioned to deliver sustainable revenue growth which is bolstered by new markets new businesses and expanded capabilities as our revenue synergies accelerate and gain traction we also remain committed to our proactive and disciplined expense management as a result we are increasingly confident in our robust return profile with expectations for 17pluspercent rotce as we deliver on our medium term financial targets in the second half of the year tim lets open up the call for qa please timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks steve operator we will now take questions operator instructions thank you operator lets open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question has come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to see if you could unpack the upgraded nii guide a little bit give us a sense as to how much of that is coming from the forward curve changes from the loan growth from the cash redeployment just to understand those puts and takes a little bit more thoroughly thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure betsy thanks for the questions this is zach ill take that the main driver is the rate curve what were seeing come through with expected forward rates to give you a sense at the time of our budget we had approximately five rate hikes baked into our forecast going from basis points up to basis points in fed funds by september of and it was basis points by the end of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 now obviously its significantly changed the yield curve up to basis points or basis points better by march and with basis points by december so a full basis points better by the end of this year so thats the majority of whats driving it given our asset sensitivity were poised to benefit from that both from spread and i would say as well from the reduced drag from fed cash that we saw in  that will help us to drive that peerleading nim that we expect at this point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then as i think about the flexibility you have in your balance sheet im just wondering how youre planning on funding the loan growth that youre anticipating getting from here and is there anything left over to increase the redeployment into the curve zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i think at this point were expecting to continue to grow deposits as well obviously nice trends and continued deposit gathering commercial growing faster than consumer but both continue to be solid producers and thatll be the main funding source as well as as i said utilizing some of the continued excess liquidity weve got on cash at this point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator thank you our next question has come from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your questions john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi in terms of the i know you mentioned that youre seeing some strengthening in loan growth momentum and you cited an improvement in line utilization can you just talk about exactly what areas are you seeing this strengthening how much did the line utilization improve and are you beginning to see capexrelated demand start to drive growth thanks huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure this is zach ill take that one and my colleagues from the room here could take on indiscernible generally were really pleased with what were seeing in loans just take a big step back the strength that were seeing in our pipelines the realization of that flowing through into bookings is what gives us confidence that well continue to see the momentum driving that high singledigits loan growth by  and the model for it is going to be pretty similar in the back half of the year as what weve seen the last two quarters that is production led with commercial growing faster than consumer but consumer continuing to drive as well and the sources of it within commercial were seeing just continued strength in midmarket our corporate specialty areas equipment inventory finance also contributing very well commercial real estate and auto dealer floorplan also delivering also on the consumer side onsheet residential mortgage is really driven by what were seeing in the mix of purchase as well as the continued steady growth in auto and rvmarine will really be the drivers there from a utilization perspective i would characterize what we saw in the quarter as modest but encouraging and i think a healthy sign for our customers saw around increase in general middle market lines several percentage point increase in inventory finance although most of that was seasonal it is encouraging sign to see the inventory navigating to flow to those dealers on more a steady basis that allows them to hold the inventory and then the auto dealer floorplan business also increased by a couple percentage points as well and again i think thats a function of just gradually improving the auto supply chain so overall a pretty healthy mix in the model going forward as i said is production and very much driven by commercial stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and john this is steve i would add we invested since closing with tcf in a number of these lending units so we have a lot of capacity that has been brought on particularly in twin cities and denver and some specialty groups so were just were able to scale the businesses as well and so well be picking up volume from these investments throughout this year and beyond richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc and john its rich the last part of your question had to do with capex spending we are absolutely seeing an increase in capital spending given just the tightness of the labor market so there is an intense move to automation and well continue to see that through the course of the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thanks and sorry if i missed this in your prepared remarks can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of your beta your deposit beta expectation and how the deposit cost could trend early on for the first basis points of hikes and then thereafter thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that one generally across the totality of the rate hike cycle our expectations is that were going to see similar dynamics this rate cycle as we saw in the last one clearly there are some competing huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 forces there with lower starting rates that might signal a higher beta but the level of excess liquidity across the industry would tend to blunt the beta and they could be lower as i think it has been noted by a number of industry participants over time i think the general operating assumption of the industry and we share this is that the early impacts around beta for the first several rate moves is going to be relatively lower and it will increase as the interest rate environment reaches a higher level but i would say two things one is whats really important to us is how were poised to manage against this with very robust very detailed primary product segmented client by client management approaches watching the market very carefully so that we can react and really be incredibly disciplined and i think secondly were poised to benefit quite a bit here through this cycle given the long strategy we had to drive our primary bank relationships and core operating accounts within our business and commercial accounts so we feel good about our position and really just being very vigilant to manage the risk as we go forward over the next few quarters john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and zach what is your through cycle beta that youre assuming in your current outgo assumption zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its about thats what we saw in the last cycle and its whats baked into our model in general john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question first question i wanted to ask was on the cost side once we get down to the about billion per quarter in expenses coming up shortly here is the plan still to hover around that level for the remainder of the year or are any of the inflationary pressures just sort of overwhelming that prior outlook zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah generally for the back half of this year we feel great about where the costs are driving to and i think we feel we got exceptionally strong line of sight to see the billion of core expense run rate by  and that will leave us then poised to really deliver on those mediumterm financial targets weve talked about huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 my expectation is roughly flat in the back half of this year were certainly seeing some inflationary pressures and as we outperform on revenue theres a bit of expenses that will drive for that but generally speaking its approximately flat in the back half of the year based on our current outlook and thats really driven by just very rigorous expense discipline throughout the company and driving for efficiency in our base expenses and with a mindset towards selffunding the investments were putting into the revenue growth initiatives that weve talked about that you just mentioned a minute ago longer term as we get out into the way were posturing our long range planning is really guided by our commitment to operating leverage which weve delivered eight of the last nine years and feel confident and proud that well do that again as we go into stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc you might also scott be aware we announced the acquisition of capstone and so r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc as that closes that run rate will have to be incorporated in as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect thank you and then zach as we look forward do you anticipate altering your rate sensitivity kind of synthetically anymore or will it just sort of be a function will changes in your sensitivity just be a function of kind of changes in the complexion of the balance sheet from here on out zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks scott for that one we really like the level of asset sensitivity that we have right now as you know we took a series of concerted actions last year to get to the point we are now and were really benefiting from it but all along that way weve talked about when opportunities came up to protect some of the downside and to lock in some of that benefit we would likely take that and so thats what you saw us do in  with a net billion of receivefixed swaps pretty modest impact on asset sensitivity as we noted in the prepared remarks around from here i would expect us to stay very much net asset sensitive in the near term meanwhile slowly adding to that downside hedge protection book over the course of the coming months as we watch the environment we will stay dynamic but that could change the general operating posture at this point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right good thank you guys very much huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks scott operator thank you our next question has come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks hey zach one followup on the cost point so if youre in that billion zoneish plus or minus towards the end of the year would we then add capstone to that and do you have an approximate calibration relative to the revenue outlook what youd expect on the cost side from capstone zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes thanks for that question i do want to make sure we clarify that so that guidance is excluding capstone excluding capstone to be clear on capstone were really diving into the modeling right now and well come back with further guidance as we get closer to and through the close based on the due diligence modeling and the companys historical run rate that we are aware of the kind of core efficiency ratio of that business is pretty similar to what other ma advisory boutique firms would have on top of that in the nearterm quarters well have a little bit of merger related costs and not expecting very significant comps there at all and then lastly some incremental compensation expenses to fund retention payments which are really important for a deal like this so more to come well give you a clear guidance on it as we get closer to the acquisition ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it and then just one question on fees in your outlook can you help us understand what the either incremental or total impact is of fair play and other changes to deposit products and are you also assuming that you continue to sell sba loans like you got back into this quarter thanks zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah no problem those are both important points as it relates to the fair play evolution nothing has changed from the guidance we provided back at march in the rbc conference which is around million of net impact on the fee line relative to the  run rate that was slightly better than the earlier guidance we provided in january and continues to be our expectation of the impact on the fee line as weve noted a number of times over time over the course of the to months after that we do expect to claw that back and to benefit from higher acquisition better retention of more account deepening as a result of those changes but thats the kind of immediate impact and then sorry the second part of your question was ken usdin q analyst jefferies company huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 the sba loans and are you baking that into the outlook as well zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so we are expecting to continue to get back to our historical practice of selling the guaranteed portion of our sba loan production it should its worth noting that the team is performing exceptionally strongly right now and really doing really really well driving production so we think thats going to support the sustainment of that sale gains which is great in  we had a bit of higher gains than we expected in the quarter just given by from the really high level of premium in the marketplace so it might kind of modulate modestly from that level as we go forward but generally that run rate will continue and the expectation is that we will continue to in fact sell that production like we have historically done stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and ken weve invested in the sba unit as well over the course of last year adding sba capabilities in colorado and minnesota in particular and theyre off to a great start so we should have a record year in terms of production ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc rich question for you can you give us your assessment of consumer health right now theres just some mixed messages out on the market and just give us your assessment of what youre thinking right now richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah no happy to from our standpoint the consumer is in very good shape particularly in the super prime segments where we play if you look at the delinquency numbers from our standpoint its all seasonal in terms of the normal patterns that were following there so we feel good what about it particularly in the spots where we play we do expect over the course of that consumer credit metrics will start to revert a bit to the norm but huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 weve remained very disciplined with our ltvs and our ficos so were very comfortable with that book it has been a steady state performer over many cycles we feel good about it stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and jon there is a phenomena of sort of lower income where the price of gas at the pump and inflation generally including the housing is having an impact but again weve been super prime for more than a decade and the consistency of the performance in that whether its residential assets or auto will hold us in very good shape we view the portfolio in aggregate to be on the low end of the risk spectrum indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay fair enough and then wondering if you guys can touch a little bit more on the inventory finance themes you called that out as a growing area and obviously its something we all watch particularly on auto but i know that the tcf business was in a few other sectors but talk a little bit about the themes and what youre seeing there stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well this is a group that has been in existence now even predating tcf that sort of formed it many years ago and were doing business with about dealers nationally so theres great distribution with the team its very high quality very steady and experienced team and weve got just an outstanding dealer relationship so were able to work with oems to be dynamically part of their sales process and there are different agreements depending on the oem in support of the dealers so again this group performs very well gone through cycles with very little loss rates and the dealers will generally support each other certainly the oems will support transitions of dealers that happens from time to time so the big issue for the group right now is just how to and whats the schedule for ramping up supply and as we talk about supply chain disruptions theyre feeling it in many areas including most of the most of the dealers so this will be a group that just naturally will grow over time because inventories are so low so we expect to do very well over the next few years with the group and its also a group that this provides great customer service has typically been adding oems every year and we would expect that to continue this year based on the discussions in the group indiscernible so very bullish for the group great team one of the hidden jewels to some extent from tcf and it will allow us to do other things on the consumer finance side and well talk about that probably in an upcoming conference jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i think i asked the same question last quarter about ltvs in auto but i guess im just curious weve seen a little bit of a trend down in the ltvs and really the disclosure on slide im looking at but just as we think about used car prices being inflated and kind of new car prices and ill add in like the rv and marine are there thoughts to kind of further tighten some of these metrics to just insulate yourself from corrections there richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey matt its rich ill take that one we actually think the lower prices the used car prices coming down is a good thing and if you look at the mix of newly used its actually picking up a little bit from the third quarter of so we are seeing more new product coming in as part of the mix from an overall standpoint we are a super prime lender in that space weve got a high fico and we use our custom score card that has been very effective in keeping us from relying on having to take the cars back in the first place so we arent really that concerned about the price movement that weve seen in the industry weve been able to keep the ltvs as you mentioned in the mid and our ficos are in that to range so we feel good about that on the rv side keep in mind too that that loan to value is based on the wholesale cost not the retail cost so thats going to show a little bit higher but if there were an 800plus fico so from our standpoint we dont see any real need to tighten weve had great experience in both of those books the rvmarine book went through its first cycle with us really in the last couple of years and outperformed our expectations from a loss standpoint so were not concerned at all about either one of those portfolios stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc weve been in the auto business matt for more than half a century and we were able to stress test the portfolios in when we had and unemployment rates so we think weve got this really dialed in and theres a discipline with this quarterly reporting that goes back over a decade that shows this consistency so while there may be some movement in loss rates the overall approach has been very low default frequency based on the underwriting matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then similar question on the mortgage on home equity book just on the next slide again really helpful thing indiscernible couple years but there weve seen a more material change in the ltv from your originations and i guess im curious is that something that youre driving or is that something that your client base is driving using more equity against these loans thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc no i think its really a combination of both but i would say its more of the customers driving it than weve done any tightening i think certainly weve been conscious of housing prices and i think what youre seeing on slide there shows that weve been disciplined with our originations and making sure that theres sufficient equity going into the loan to keep us safe if theres a drop in values huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we like secured consumer lending matt as weve shared in the past and we believe that will put us in comparably great shape through the cycles operator thank you our next question has come from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i wanted to follow up with betsys earlier line of questioning zach im wondering if you could quantify the earning asset growth that youre expecting i know youre looking forward to more deposit growth from here but just thinking about how we should think about earning asset growth relative to that high singledigit loan growth and also at what point in absolute rate should we start modeling in our thinking about positive total deposit growth but perhaps negative mix shift away from noninterest bearing deposits zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah good questions but let me see we can add some incremental color as it relates to sort of the earning asset side of your question there were really two parts to it one that loan growth in the high singledigits as we talked about secondly is on the securities book right now were standing at about i think precisely its of assets on securities i think we will stay within the range of to of securities to assets here for the foreseeable future as we manage yield and liquidity and just general balance sheet management so those two factors will drive i think the earning assets like was to be pretty similar to that loan growth guidance from a deposit perspective its hard to sort of be overly precise in terms of the threshold level where things start to unstick and move our general assumption is that its going to be a relatively lower beta initially higher later and so well see that trending throughout the period and so thats sort of generally the dynamic the one thing i would just maybe add to my comment around the earning asset growth is just remember as well that we will have one factor that will draw that down a bit is the cash side where were continuing to redeploy our cash into funding the loan growth and so thats weve got around billion on average now thatll trend down throughout the course of the year back toward more like billion typical operating rates we see which will pull downward the earning assets growth but certainly will benefit nim as we redeploy that into higher earning assets erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question is for steve steve youve done a good job in terms of balancing investing into the franchise and extracting cost savings some cost savings to fund that and delivering on the tcf cost savings huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 im wondering as we think about the revenue setup from here we clearly got ph some gap to second half outlook but good performing banks are thinking about that are sort of settled in their investment cycle have been saying something like to expense growth to sort of a core expense growth to think about in the future taking into account inflation is that something that seems reasonable for your company as we look forward past the second half of stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well weve guided for the second half of earlier you heard zachs comments of generally being flattish around billion of expense and that would include the expectations of inflation and other investments that we plan to make we started with a view of last august when we did around the expense reductions to set up and deal with the inflation erika and that included the branches that consolidated in early february this year so were on track with the plan that we laid out last summer and were on track if not ahead with tcf at this point so a lot of confidence in this year and then well be adding capstone we think weve got revenue synergies coming with that as well so we like how were positioned at this stage and optimistic certainly very confident for the year and optimistic about going forward we will be dynamic with operating expenses relative to revenues weve committed to positive operating leverage and i think its eight out of nine years in the past and you can count on that being part of our equation erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you so much steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks erika operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i just had one question steve and zach i think you mentioned youll hit the 17plus mediumterm rotce target back half of the year just talk to us in terms of the sustainability of the rotce profile from your looking into the mediumterm just in terms of the downside risk as we think about maybe getting to a point where the fed goes back to cutting interest rates some normalization in credit whats the level of rotce that you think is defensible even in a less conducive revenue backdrop huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc this is zach and ill take the first shot at that and then let steve to see if he wants to tack on as well generally i feel great about the level so for the foreseeable future and frankly i was forecasting that level even at the budgeted rate curve which i mentioned before was considerably lower than the current rate curve so i think that i feel good about that level over the mediumterm as we said one of the things that were frankly internally were really excited about is getting to the second half of the year delivering these mediumterm targets that we first put out in december of when we announced the tcf acquisition and then being able to reset and provide some updated guidance at that point and my expectation is well see at or above that level that guidance as well stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so just to add we had a very good first quarter weve talked since the fourth quarter about growing momentum but we are not hitting on all cylinders we still see a lot of upside on the tcf synergies and on some of the other investments weve made so theres a revenue dynamic that we hope well be able to continue and expect to be able to continue to develop throughout this year and that will provide some cushion for the normalized provision as well as at some of different scenarios i like the way the businesses are positioned were roughly balanced as you know consumer and business and on the business side weve had a lot of scale added with tcf and investments made in new capabilities and products and youll continue to see that thats part of the plan as we go forward this year and i think thats going to position us to have a consistency over the next few years in a variety of scenarios zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc the one thing i would really tack onto that just at the end here is a key contributor to this is not only our balance sheet and capital allocation which is just ever more robust and dialed in to drive best in class returns but also the growth of our fee businesses notwithstanding our guidance that we provided this quarter where fees will be growing sort of slower than spread by  of this year just driven by the extraordinary rate environment driven by some temporal factors in mortgage and our fair play product evolution broadly speaking though i think in the course of the longterm which was the nature of your question i expect fee revenues to grow as a percentage of revenues by around percentage point per year and i think that disciplined capital allocation driving for returns the driving toward fee intensive businesses and payments and capital markets and our wealth and advisory those things are the ones that sort of contribute to that sustaining roe even under various interest rate scenarios ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just as a quick followup to that heard you own no buybacks this year but when we think about capital allocation and you mentioned on the fee side anything that we should expect in terms of inorganic growth be it capstonelike transactions or anything on the fintech side or wealth management that youre looking at huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well there are fee businesses that if they were available would be interesting to us but i would characterize them generally on the smaller side and wouldnt change the overall guidance that zach provided to you as we continue to build out our capabilities we will from time to time as we did with the huntington technology finance i think four or five years ago and so this is there may be some opportunities over the next couple of years to complement our capabilities and build the feegenerating potential to an even greater extent than what zach portrayed and if we find things that make sense and would be additive to our customer service and our customer growth then that wed look at that but were generally very focused on driving the opportunities we have in hand with the tcf combination and the investments weve already made ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks a lot operator thank you our next question has come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to first follow up on deposits i didnt fully understand your response to erikas question whats the deposit growth assumption thats underlying the nii guide for zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 well i havent provided that guidance precisely but i do expect continued lets call it midsingle digits deposit growth overall commercial growing faster consumer growing a little slower but both growing and i think on the consumer side we are not seeing any imminent signs of any change in the level of savings activity and sort of trends around deposits i think the whole concept of surge balances has been somewhat debunked at this point theyre fairly sticky and the trends are fairly stable on the consumer side on the commercial side were really benefiting from just sort of penetrating operating accounts and our focus on treasury management thats driving that as well as new client acquisition through particularly our growth in middle market and our specialty areas so generally seeing positive continued growth in deposit to be on that kind of midsingle digit slope steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then steve on the capstone deal is this really intended to make you more of a one stop shop right better position you to serve existing clients or is this a new focus for huntington right are you going to invest meaningfully in this capability and do you plan to build your banking capabilities around these new verticals youre picking up thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc capstone is as you know top ranked middle market investment banking advisory firm in its own right but we have a significant client base that if the services were made available to them would help us expand our menu of crosssell and eventually even feed our wealth businesses so we felt this was an important additional component to the core delivery it does give us expertise in a select number of verticals that they have as well or access to that and i think thatll help the commercial bank grow overall i suspect theyll continue to build out their investment banking capabilities on a national basis so that would be additive but we really think its synergistic with us at the core of what were doing and are quite optimistic about this we have been working with them for over a year in terms of a fee share arrangement for certain referrals ph both was and have really got insight the culture of the company and its capabilities and thats what made this opportunity very attractive steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and do you plan on building out the banking in areas like fintech services energy et cetera is that part of the plan stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we dont have plans on the buildout yet we have a were maybe a couple of months away from even closing on what they have but where they have specialty capabilities now that we will take advantage of those well look at that if theres some augmentation to scale up to where they have existing capabilities and then over time well assess new areas steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of brian foran with autonomous please proceed with your questions brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi i guess maybe one followup on deposits and ill preface it i definitely remember last time or last rising rate cycle you really outperformed the industry on deposit growth especially low cost deposit growth so kind of history is on your side and youve done it before but i guess midsingle digit growth led by commercial like indiscernible flattish deposit growth this year with commercial maybe declining a bit so you listed a couple of reasons but can you just maybe flesh out kind of your high single digit commercial growth in an environment where peers are down a little bit what is really how do you get that much differentiation zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc its hard to say much about the comparison with peers not knowing whats in their business and the visibility that theyve got all i can tell you is we seem to be gaining market share and winning particularly on the commercial side and i think its not surprising to us because weve been investing in our commercial business and the flowthrough of deposits is sort of the manifestation of the returns on those investments weve been making both exclusive of tcf and then as of late really capturing the tcf opportunities to build in middle market as we said were building out terrific middle market teams in the denver and colorado area in the twin cities and just generally seizing the opportunities thats available within the new tcf geographies for huntington in that space and also business banking i would say so again its hard to make the comparison other than to say we are seeing those trends manifest and its encouraging as i said before our focus is making sure that this is not hot money these are really core accounts we often use treasury as sort of the treasury management as the tip of the spear to really drive penetration of not only the capabilities in those services but ultimately to cement those operating accounts in terms of the strategy so thats the trends were seeing feel confident about that forecast stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc right weve had optimal customer relationship our ocr approach is to deepening our crosssell for more than a decade now and the tcf business lines did not they just didnt have the capabilities so theres a broad base of customers that we have access to that were very focused on weve talked about a tool called edge that weve put in place a data tool for the commercial teams and that we put that in place in the fourth quarter thats giving us a lot of insight and traction coming on that overall ocr strategy so good execution by the teams we also shared over the fourth quarter third quarter calls if i remember correctly that we were using an investment portal with one of our partners to move some of the deposits off huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 balance sheet with a view that wed bring some of them back on as rate cycle changed and well do that as well so those maybe some of the contributing factors in addition to what zach shared thank you for the question brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp if maybe i could squeeze in one on capital and its as much an industry question its huntington specific but i guess does the tangible common equity ratio mattered all this cycle i mean its certainly getting lower for you and a lot of peers than it has been in a long time but its driven by rates aoci is kind of a funky concept fair value is one line item not any other is it just solely about the cet1 ratio is there any level of tce ratio that you view as a floor should we care about the tce ratio at all i guess is the crux of the question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc brian and that was the only ratio that we cared about right but the industry clearly has migrated to cet1 its surprising to me your question is the first one in probably a decade had of this nature and were obviously focused on it as well thats why we have a fairly high htm percentage of the investment portfolio weve done certain other actions including the hedging that zach described today and well continue to look at that but it does not appear to be a driver it does not come up in regulatory conversations so it would seem that the investment community and the regulatory community both moved on to cet1 brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp thats great thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our final questions for today will come from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks i just had a quick followup question on indirect auto if you could talk a little bit about the outlook for indirect auto some of the peers are pulling back because of the loan pricing pressures im just wondering what your thoughts are stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we really like that asset class and weve been with it in and out of cycles it is a shortduration paper on average as zach shared it earlier months weighted average life so even in rising rates it gets a little tighter and in declining rates the spread looks great were with it we will stay with it on a consistent basis and thats part of the value to the dealers and so weve shown in the past a relative premium pricing as a consequence of the consistency in the market we believe were huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 still achieving that and we like the asset a lot it will narrow a bit in terms of spread in a rising rate environment but its a shortlived asset and its still better than many of the alternatives as you heard from rich were confident in the performance so this is from our perspective of good asset of ph 1plus roa asset historically and our dealers our auto dealers tend to be the deepest crosssell total relationship crosssell that we have in the company peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks peter operator ladies and gentlemen
