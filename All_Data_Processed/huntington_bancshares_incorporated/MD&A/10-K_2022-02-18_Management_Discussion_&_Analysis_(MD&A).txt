risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans huntington bancshares incorporated table of contents we measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates we presume that market rates will not go below the scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the board of directors at least quarterly a comprehensive discussion of risk management governance can be found in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the

months as well as an instantaneous parallel shock of basis points the nii at risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both december and december the increase in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market interest rate expectations and the size and mix of the balance sheet table start table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change

table of contents we have liborbased exposure in the form of variable rate loans derivatives series b preferred stock long term debt and other securities and financial arrangements to address the discontinuance of libor in its current form we established a libor transition team and project plan under the oversight of the cro and cfo providing periodic updates to the roc as of december huntington ceased issuance of new libor loans all legacy huntington contracts that reference libor have been reviewed to determine if fallback language is needed and legacy tcf contracts are in the review process remediation efforts coordinated by the libor transition team will be complete by june of source systems have been updated to support alternative reference rates at this time alternative reference rates are predominantly sofr based as such we have developed a sofrenabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from libor to sofr we continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates including the recent announcements from the ice benchmark administrator to extend the cessation date for several usd libor tenors to june for a discussion of the risks associated with the libor transition to alternative reference rates refer to item risk factors use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps caps and floors forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap and floor positions and cap positions that existed at the prior year end that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates the interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin these positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index the positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements huntington bancshares incorporated table of contents the following

consolidated financial statements at december we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit

opportunities we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we rely on a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk the board of directors approves the liquidity strategy and furthermore reviews the acceptable level of liquidity risk policy and procedures established by senior management the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits liquidity risk is managed centrally by corporate treasury our liquidity position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing

provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled billion as of december the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles

we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps caps and floors financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information standby lettersofcredit standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to

cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality form 10k table of contents to mitigate operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and our audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the

segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance we have four major business segments commercial banking consumer and business banking vehicle finance and regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions for a discussion of business segment trends for versus see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment discussion included in our form 10k filed with the sec on february form 10k table of contents revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported acquisitionrelated expenses if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates

regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in

critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below allowance for credit losses our acl at december represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the acl by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and gross domestic product changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate form 10k table of contents however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario includes assumptions around increased covid19 morbidity and mortality rates additionally consumer confidence declines with the resulting drop in consumer spending sending the economy back into recession in the first quarter of under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate increases and remains elevated for a prolonged period the rate is estimated at and at the end of and respectively these numbers result in unemployment rates that are approximately and higher than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our acl at december management calculated the difference between our quantitative acl and a adverse scenario excluding consideration of general reserve adjustments this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of approximately billion at december the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for our general reserve and associated risk profile components incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as the current covid19 pandemic could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the current covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note loans leases and note allowance for credit losses of the notes to consolidated financial statements acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this method often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective acquisitionrelated restructuring costs are expensed as incurred the acquisition method of accounting does allow for a measurement period to make adjustments to acquisition accounting for up to one year after the acquisition date for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time for more information see note acquisition of tcf financial corporation of the notes to consolidated financial statements huntington bancshares incorporated table of contents fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including securities and derivative instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment including among others discount rates rates of return on assets cash flows default rates loss rates terminal values and liquidation values a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities at june approximately billion of our assets and billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value as a result of applying the acquisition method of accounting the fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models which involve inputs that are observable level or level in fair value hierarchy when available the level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets level do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available levels and may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy additional discussion regarding fair value measurements and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs can be found in note fair value of assets and liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets acquisitions typically result in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets including but not limited to customer deposit intangibles recent accounting pronouncements and developments note accounting standards update of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition results of operations or liquidity the impacts are discussed in the applicable
