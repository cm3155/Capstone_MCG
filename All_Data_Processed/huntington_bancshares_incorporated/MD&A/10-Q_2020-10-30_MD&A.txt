risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios see note investment securities and other securities of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements huntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal we focus on the early identification monitoring and management of all aspects of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our ongoing expansion of

design features origination policies and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers we have assessed the impact of covid19 on our loan portfolio as we would with any natural disaster or significant economic decline huntington proactively addressed the situation by offering our customers payment deferrals and the suspension of late fees while also suspending repossession and foreclosures we believe that these decisions were prudent due to the widespread impact economic conditions had on both commercial and consumer borrowers during the third quarter we reinstated late fees and repossessions while continuing to offer payment help to impacted borrowers the longer term impact of our response is dependent upon a number of variables including the prolonged impact of the covid19 virus and its impact on the economic recovery continued elevated unemployment could lead to increased delinquencies and defaults in our consumer portfolio additionally increased economic

allowance for credit losses of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements our total credit reserve is comprised of two different components both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl effective january huntington adopted asu financial instruments credit losses asc topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments upon adoption of asu huntington implemented new credit loss models within our loan and lease portfolio these models incorporate historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to generate a loss rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that utilize assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key parameters probability of default pd exposure at default ead and loss given default lgd beyond the reasonable and supportable period two to three years the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario these three parameters are utilized to estimate the cumulative credit losses over the remaining expected life of the loan we also consider the likelihood a previously chargedoff account will be recovered this calculation is huntington bancshares incorporated table of conten ts dependent on how long ago the account was chargedoff and future economic conditions which estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery our models are developed using internal historical loss experience covering the full economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels discussed below these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain geography based variables that are influential to our modeling process the most significant being unemployment rates and gdp the probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management additionally we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the economic scenarios lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics risk ratings origination credit bureau scores delinquency status and remaining months within loan agreements among other factors the macroeconomic scenarios evaluated by huntington during the third quarter continued to reflect the impact of the covid19 pandemic the baseline scenario used for the quarter assumes that the worst of the economic disruption from the pandemic has passed with the expectation that subsequent waves of the virus will not carry the same level of economic disruption experienced to date given that expectation unemployment is forecast at at the end of third quarter compared to for the prior quarter this unemployment variable is incorporated within our models as both a rate of change and level variable historically changes in unemployment have taken gradual paths resulting in more measured impacts each quarter the baseline scenario forecasts stronger gdp growth for the rest of and throughout compared to the second quarter forecast driven by additional fiscal stimulus which is now anticipated before the end of the table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of these key macroeconomic variables has changed since the first quarter table forecasted key macroeconomic variables baseline scenario forecast    unemployment rate gross domestic product values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented not updated for subsequent actual amounts the uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic prompted management to continue to assess the macroeconomic environment through the end of the quarter management considered multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to capture the severity of and the economic disruption associated with the pandemic while we have incorporated our estimated impact of covid19 into our allowance for credit losses the ultimate impact of covid19 is still uncertain including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses given significant covid19 specific government relief programs and potential stimulus packages as well as certain limitations of our models in the current economic environment particularly the level of unemployment management developed additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results form 10q table of conten ts given the fundamental uncertainty that remains within the economy and contemplating the downside risks associated with the third quarter baseline scenario assumptions for example that there will not be a second wave of the virus that seriously disrupts business activity again the executive level committee responsible for the governance process around the use of economic scenarios determined that it was appropriate to use a probability weighted scenario to estimate the appropriateness and adequacy of the allowance as of the third quarter our acl development methodology committee is responsible for governance of the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date the loss modeling process uses an ead concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded commitments where appropriate losses related to the unfunded commitments are then recorded as aulc within other liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet a liability for expected credit losses for offbalance sheet credit exposures is recognized if huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable huntington adopted asc topic using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets in scope of the standard results for reporting periods beginning after january are presented under asc topic while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap upon

january was comprised of a million increase in the commercial alll a million increase in the consumer alll and a million increase to the aulc the increase in the commercial portfolio was largely attributable to adjustments to cover heightened risks of future deterioration in the oil and gas and leveraged lending portfolios the increase in the consumer portfolio was largely attributable to the

and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in huntingtons balance sheet huntington compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on

basis point shock scenario by the board as a policy metric beginning september management does consider additional scenarios with forecasted negative market rates which would result in margin deterioration the increase in sensitivity was driven by the impact of lower forecast rates on nonmaturity deposits resulting in slower balance runoff and higher securities prepayments in the implied forward scenario resulting in more opportunity for reinvestment at higher rates in rising rate environments additionally an increase in the securities portfolio and the hedge program have also resulted in increased sensitivity our nii at risk is within our board of directors policy limits for the and basis point scenarios the nii at risk shows that our balance sheet is asset sensitive at

sensitivity was driven primarily by lower interest rates slowing deposit runoff and to a lesser extent expected securities portfolio runoff use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps interest rate floors forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps

reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality to mitigate operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and the audit committee as appropriate significant form 10q table of conten ts findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk monitoring techniques and strategies minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance capital both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate as disclosed in our form 10k the us federal banking regulatory agencies permitted bhcs and banks to phasein for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of the new cecl accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years as part of its response to the impact of covid19 the us federal banking regulatory agencies issued a

huntingtons election of a fiveyear transition to delay for two years the full impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period at september we maintained basel iii capital ratios in excess of the wellcapitalized standards established by the frb the balance sheet growth was driven predominately by ppp loans and elevated deposits at the federal reserve both of which are risk weighted and as such did not have a material impact on the regulatory capital ratios the capital impact of the repurchase of million of common stock over the last four quarters none in

shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at september an increase of billion or when compared with december due to the issuance of million of series f preferred stock and million of series g preferred stock in the second quarter and third quarter respectively on june we were notified by the frb that under the severely adverse economic stress scenario in the supervisory stress tests our modeled capital ratios would continue to exceed the minimum requirements under the frbs capital adequacy rules in addition the frb assigned us a stress capital buffer of which is the minimum under the stress capital buffer framework our stress capital buffer is in effect from october until september unless the frb provides us with a revised stress capital buffer in connection with our resubmitted capital plan as discussed further below the frb may but is not required to recalculate a large bhcs stress capital buffer after receiving an updated capital plan form 10q table of conten ts the frb also announced that certain large bhcs including huntington will not be permitted to make share repurchases subject to certain limited exceptions during the third and fourth quarters of but will be permitted to make dividend payments in the fourth quarter subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter and the banks average net income for the four preceding quarters our fourth quarter dividend that was declared by the board of directors on october complies with these limits in addition large bhcs including huntington are required to update and resubmit their capital plans during fourth quarter to reflect ongoing stresses caused by the covid19 pandemic the frb will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if the restrictions on fourth quarter capital distributions should be extended to future quarters dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective with dividends representing one component our strong capital ratios position us to take advantage of additional capital management opportunities share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions

leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance we have four major business segments consumer and business banking commercial banking vehicle finance and regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from huntington bancshares incorporated table of conten ts treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported significant items if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact

regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion of this report critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our december form 10k as supplemented by this report including this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting estimates relate to our acl valuation of financial instruments contingent liabilities income taxes and deferred tax assetsliabilities these significant accounting estimates and their related application are discussed in our december form 10k allowance for credit losses our acl at september represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit management estimates the allowance for credit losses by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the allowance for credit losses estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and gross domestic product changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modelling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate this quarter however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario includes assumptions around new infections and covid19 deaths being significantly above the baseline projections leading to a much slower reopening of huntington bancshares incorporated table of conten ts the economy under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at and at the end of and respectively these numbers represent a higher unemployment estimate than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters management calculated the difference between a baseline weighting and a adverse scenario weighting for modeled results this would result in an incremental quantitative allowance impact of approximately billion the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios the sensitivity estimate does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework it is important to note that the baseline and adverse scenarios already incorporate material deterioration from those used in calculating the day one cecl adjustment on january 1st we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as the current covid19 pandemic could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the current covid19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note allowance for credit losses of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and include trading securities availableforsale securities other securities loans held for sale loans held for investment msrs and derivative instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility significant adjustments and assumptions used in determining fair value include but are not limited to market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputs and are classified within levels and instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy form 10q table of conten ts at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs at the measurement date the fair values

inputs can be found in note fair values of assets and liabilities of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements goodwill the emergence of covid19 as a global pandemic during has resulted in significant deterioration of the economic environment which has impacted expected earnings the heightened uncertainty in the economic environment has continued into the third quarter as a result management performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill balance at september the result of this assessment indicated it was probable that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to exceed the respective carrying values and therefore management determined that a full goodwill test was not warranted goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or further deterioration in the economic outlook continued assessments of our

categories described below olem the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect huntingtons position in the future for these reasons huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans substandard inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated doubtful loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high loans are generally assigned a category of pass rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrowers financial performance commercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial

applies to offbalance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under asc topic additionally asc topic made changes to the accounting for afs debt securities including a requirement to present credit losses as an allowance rather than as a writedown on afs debt securities that management does not intend to sell or believes will not be required

sheet reflects the net amount huntington expects to collect amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding net of purchase premiums and discounts fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred fees and costs subsequent changes favorable and unfavorable in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense management estimates the allowance by projecting probabilityofdefault lossgivendefault and exposureatdefault depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term those economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts huntingtons reasonable and supportable forecast period reverts to a historical norm based on inputs within approximately two to three years the reversion period is dependent on the state of the economy at the beginning of the forecast historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with adjustments made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix delinquency levels and terms as well as for changes in the micro and macroeconomic environments the contractual terms of financial assets are adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions outside of huntingtons control loans that are determined to have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis by management if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date less costs to sell as appropriate loans with unique risk characteristics that are not subject to collateral dependent accounting are assessed using a discounted cash flows methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist management believes the products within each of the entitys portfolio classes exhibit similar risk characteristics huntington has identified its portfolio classes as disclosed above allowance for credit losses htm securities nearly all of huntingtons htm debt securities are issued by us government

could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established for certain matters huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss in cases in which huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below there may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of

loss is to million at september in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters this estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly
