item risk factors summary of risk factors the following is a summary of some of the material risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our business credit risk we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan clients and counterparties various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase or to be inadequate declining asset prices could adversely affect us geopolitical destabilization could adversely impact our loan portfolios compliance risk we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and cybersecurity which could limit our ability to pursue business initiatives increase the cost of doing business and subject us to compliance risks and potential liability changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations operational risk we are subject to a variety of operational risks we and third parties on which we rely including their downstream service providers may experience a cyberattack technology failure information system or security breach or interruption we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us we are and may in the future be subject to claims litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational harm our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by severe weather and natural disasters exacerbated by climate change societal and governmental responses to climate change could adversely affect keys business and performance including indirectly through impacts on keys customers the increased use of remote work infrastructure has expanded potential attack vectors and resulted in increased operational risks liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by banking regulations require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets federal agencies actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels our credit ratings affect our liquidity position market risk a worsening of the us economy and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and in certain market segments in which we conduct significant business the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us depressed market values for our common stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require us to write down all or some portion of our goodwill table of contents reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly impact our business and major stakeholders key is subject to environmental social and governance esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation the trading price of our common stock andor our business and results of operations strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives we operate in a highly competitive industry maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive products and services we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the material risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies keys major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report i credit risk we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than single family residential real estate loans and other types of consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of loans in this category could cause an increase in criticized and nonperforming loans which could result in lower earnings from these loans additional provision for loan and lease losses and ultimately an increase in loan losses should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected recent federal reserve monetary policy including shrinkage of its balance sheet and incremental increases in target interest rates early in followed by a sustained period of relatively high target interest rates throughout the latter part of continue to impact the commercial and residential real estate markets capitalization rates are rising and property value appreciation has slowed or is now declining in many markets within keys footprint property values have begun to decrease industrial and retail properties continue to remain stable but multifamily office hospitality and single family detached properties are beginning to show signs of deterioration development and construction continue but at muted levels and deliveries of additional units into the market have been supported oversupply of multifamily housing is a concern in certain urban and gateway markets however our exposures in those markets are limited for example approximately of our multifamily portfolio is located in new york city chicago los angeles and san francisco we also have no exposure to rent controlled properties in new york city the most severely impacted commercial real estate segments have been in office keys nonowner occupied office exposures are of our total commercial real estate exposure substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could negatively impact our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate but in the comparatively better performing multifamily space over the cycle a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans or to refinance the loans at maturity a table of contents relatively small portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans new construction and valueadd or rehabilitation construction projects may not be fully leased at loan origination these properties typically require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply performance under existing leases could deteriorate and the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrowers ability to cover debt service payments we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan clients and counterparties many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk including the risk of default of our counterparties which include other financial institutions or clients our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client in addition given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times a financial institution or other counterparty failure such as the bank failures in early or a cybersecurity breach could result in the failure of or disruption to a counterparty or client which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase or to be inadequate we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance at december represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of our existing loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to such as gdp unemployment sofr and other interest rates the producer price index and real estate values along with updated information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll further the multitude and totality of factors impacting our estimates and the subjectivity of components of its calculation may cause the alll to be an inadequate representation of the actual losses incurred over the life of our loan portfolio both an increase in the alll and actual losses exceeding our current estimates will reduce our net income and could impact our capital positions and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations declining asset prices could adversely affect us during periods of economic stress the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experience may reach and have in the past reached extreme levels market disruption may severely stress or even lead to the failure of financial institutions which can cause further credit market constriction and further liquidation of assets driving asset prices down even more asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of collateral and certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable the most recent recession resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic did not have significant lasting impact on collateral value however there are still risks to economic stability that could reverse recent stable trends in asset prices these risks include a correction in equity or housing markets supply chain issues such as closed factories and disrupted port activity as well as the impact of the russiaukraine war and the israelhamas war on global transportation and the availability of materials laborsupply constraints leading to slowing job growth and boosting wages along with inflation wageprice spiral and table of contents negative gdp growth as a result of in part the federal reserves monetary policy efforts to arrest inflationary pressures within the broader economy geopolitical destabilization could adversely impact our loan portfolios while we have minimal direct foreign company exposure in our loan portfolios there are correlated and contingent risks posed by geopolitical destabilization within our loan portfolio for example conflicts across the world including the russiaukraine war and the israelhamas war have proven to have a material impact on certain domestic commodity prices impacting our borrowers input costs and disrupting supply chains both domestically and abroad these factors increase potential defaults in our loan portfolio and could ultimately increase loan losses ii compliance risk we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and tax legislation banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank acts heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarly situated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly with respect to consumer bankingrelated practices including fair and responsible banking fair lending unfair deceptive or abusive practices and the community reinvestment act as well as compliance with aml bsa and office of foreign assets control efforts changes to existing statutes and regulations and taxes including industryspecific taxes and surcharges or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways interpretation of consumer bankingrelated regulations may evolve as the industry and the regulators seek to increase access to banking products and services by consumers for example the cfpb has launched an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge including the issuance of proposed rules that would significantly reduce the permissible amount of credit card late fees and nsf fees on transactions that are declined instantaneously or nearinstantaneously and the issuance of an advisory opinion prohibiting large financial institutions including key from imposing unreasonable obstacles on customers such as charging excessive fees for basic information about their own accounts such changes may subject us to additional costs adversely impact our income and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply and may also impact consumer behavior limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate in addition changes to laws and regulations may impact our customers by requiring them to adjust their operations or practices or impair their ability to pay fees or outstanding loans or afford new products which could negatively impact demand for our products and services certain federal regulations have been in existence for decades without modification to account for modern banking practices such as digital delivery of products and services which can create challenges in execution and in the examination process emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies could limit keybanks ability to track the movement of funds keybanks ability to comply with bsaaml and other regulations is dependent on its ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive failure to comply with these and other regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto may result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business moreover different government administrations may have different regulatory priorities which may impact the level of regulation of financial institutions and the enforcement environment table of contents for more information see supervision and regulation in item of this report we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and cybersecurity which could limit our ability to pursue business initiatives increase the cost of doing business and subject us to compliance risks and potential liability we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of our customers employees job applicants and other individuals complying with laws and regulations applicable to our collection use transfer and storage of personal information can increase operating costs impact the development and marketing of new products or services and reduce operational efficiency any mishandling or misuse of personal information by key or our vendors could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions at the federal level we are subject to the grammleachbliley act of as amended which requires financial institutions to among other things periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing personal information and in some cases enables customers to opt out of the sharing of certain nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties we are also subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices including with respect to privacy and cybersecurity a number of states have also recently enacted consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information or issued guidance regarding the same such as the california consumer privacy act of as amended by the california privacy rights act known as the ccpa and the new york department of financial services cybersecurity regulations in addition there has been a significant increase in privacyrelated litigation in recent years with respect to how organizations collect information and technical data from their public facing websites and federal and state courts have been creating new legal frameworks around consumer and website privacy which also creates new risks on businesses as new privacyrelated laws and regulations and judiciallycreated frameworks are implemented in jurisdictions in which keybank operates the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase compliance with these laws and regulations has required and may continue to require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject us to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of keys financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results iii operational risk we are subject to a variety of operational risks in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees or others outside of key clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats from cyber activity and computertelecommunications malfunctions fraudulent activity has escalated become more sophisticated and is ever evolving as there are more options to access financial services operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business table of contents such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs including remediation costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities we rely on our employees to design manage and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into record and manage processes transactions and other relationships with customers vendors suppliers and other parties with whom we do business we also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities these concerns are increased when we change processes or procedures introduce new products or services or implement new technologies as we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes these concerns may be further exacerbated by employee turnover or labor shortages as a result of our necessary reliance on employees to perform these tasks and manage resulting risks we are thus subject to human vulnerabilities these range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business including risks associated with the design operation and monitoring of automated systems we may also fail to adequately develop a culture of risk management among our employees we and third parties on which we rely including their downstream service providers may experience a cyberattack technology failure information system or security breach or interruption we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our employees customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings expand our internal usage of webcloudbased products and applications and maintain and develop new relationships with thirdparty providers including their downstream service providers in addition our ability to extend protections to customers information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems or that of a third party that provides services to us or our customers we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers for example we may experience operational disruptions or interruptions as a result of a cyber incident including disruption caused by protective containment measures taken by us such as taking certain first or thirdparty systems offline for a prolonged period such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key have had third parties on which they rely experience such breaches in addition several financial institutions including key have experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disrupt disable or degrade services or sabotage systems or data other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential proprietary or personal information or intellectual property to extort money through the use of ransomware or other extortion tactics or to alter or destroy data or systems often through various attack vectors and methods including the introduction of computer viruses or malicious code commonly referred to as malware phishing cyberattacks account takeovers credential stuffing and other means to the extent that we use third parties to provide services to our clients we cannot control all of the risks at these third parties or third parties downstream service providers hardware software or applications developed by key or received from third parties may contain exploitable vulnerabilities bugs or defects in design maintenance or manufacture or other issues that could unpredictably compromise information and cybersecurity we depend on third party service providers and their downstream service providers to implement adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cyber incidents if such parties fail to deter detect or report cyber incidents in a timely manner we may suffer from financial and other harm including to our information operations performance employees and reputation in addition should an adverse event affecting another companys systems occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to fully compensate us or otherwise protect us or our clients from the consequences to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a material impact on our business strategy results of operations or financial condition table of contents in addition our customers routinely use keyissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions conducted with businesses in person and over the internet if the businesss systems that process or store debit or credit card information experience a security breach our card holders may experience fraud on their card accounts we may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions as well as for other costs such as replacing impacted cards key also provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data breach we also face risks related to the increasing interdependence and interconnectivity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other security breach that significantly compromises the systems of one or more financial parties or service providers in the financial system could have a material impact on counterparties or market participants including us any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service clients or otherwise operate our business and could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm additionally the increasing use of thirdparty financial data aggregators and emerging technologies including the use of automation artificial intelligence and robotics introduces new information security risks and exposure for us and for our third party service providers such technologies could also result in increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sourcesmalicious actors including but not limited to persons who constitute an insider threat who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering phishing mobile phone malware and sim card swapping and other methods our security systems and those of the thirdparty service providers on which we rely may not be able to protect our information systems or data from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that a malicious actor or our employees may intercept andor transmit or otherwise misuse unauthorized personal confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expense in an effort to improve the reliability and resilience of our systems and their security against internal and external threats nonetheless we cannot guarantee our measures will be effective or sufficient to prevent a cyber incident and there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur if one does occur it could go undetected and persist for an extended period of time andor we may be unable to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately while we do maintain cyber information security and business interruption insurance losses from a major interruption may exceed our coverage and there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf additionally some of our third parties outsource aspects of their operations to downstream service providers these parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity and breakdowns or failures of their own systems internal processes and controls or employees one or more of these third parties or their downstream service providers may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third partys ability to serve us any unanticipated interruption delay or degradation in the performance and delivery of our services could negatively impact our customer relationships additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to identify or develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select contract with evaluate engage with and manage their third parties including such third parties use of subcontractors affects the table of contents circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and their subcontractors and the cost of managing such relationships we are and may in the future be subject to claims litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational harm we are subject to and may in the future be subject to claims or legal actions taken against us by customers vendors shareholders or other parties further keycorp and certain of its directors and officers are currently named and have in the past been named and may be named in the future as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to our business and activities we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting compliance and operational matters which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief which if significant could adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition enforcement authorities may also seek admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters and any such resolution of a matter involving key could lead to increased exposure to private litigation could adversely affect keys reputation and could result in limitations on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions further enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may in turn restrict or limit our activities in recent years there has been an increase in the number of investigations and proceedings in the financial services industry a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution may give rise to an inquiry or investigation by regulators or other authorities of the same or similar practices by key for example on february affiliates of key entered into a settlement agreement with the secs division of enforcement to resolve an investigation of the affiliates compliance with records preservation requirements related to business communications sent over offchannel electronic messaging platforms the settlement resulted in payment of a million penalty to the sec along with other prospective relief the sec has conducted similar investigations of other financial institutions as part of a widely publicized industry sweep that has included publicly announced settlements with multiple firms the outcome of regulatory matters as well as the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks additionally our internal audit function provides an independent assessment and testing of keys internal controls policies and procedures any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed operated and tested is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met the systems may not work as intended or be circumvented by employees third parties or others outside of key additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively or fully mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by severe weather and natural disasters exacerbated by climate change natural disasters including wildfires tornadoes severe storms and hurricanes have seemingly become more frequent and severe due to climate change the timing and effects of these natural disasters are difficult to accurately predict and the potential impact of such disasters on our operations employees and customers could table of contents have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations given our broad regional focus we are exposed to a wide range of weatherrelated risk across different geographical areas severe weather events can directly affect our operations by interrupting systems damaging facilities disrupting our supply chain and hindering our ability to conduct business as usual additionally these events can indirectly impact us by damaging or destroying customer businesses impairing their ability to repay loans or causing damage to properties pledged as collateral for loans made by key although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage such measures could be costly and any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as usual in addition the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather events and recurring extreme weather events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance our failure to comply with evolving regulatory requirements related to natural disaster risk management may also result in legal and financial consequences societal and governmental responses to climate change could adversely affect keys business and performance including indirectly through impacts on keys customers concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and may continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts new andor more stringent regulatory requirements could materially affect our results by requiring us to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be adopted by federal state and local governments consumers and businesses also may change their own behavior as a result of these concerns key and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns key and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions operating process changes and the like in addition the multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations regarding climate change that have been or may be adopted by various jurisdictions could increase our cost of doing business and make compliance with such laws and regulations more difficult the impact on keys customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities changes to regulations or market shifts to lowcarbon products could impact the credit worthiness or the value of assets securing loans of some of our customers which may require us to adjust our lending portfolios and business strategies keys efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions including by increasing business relationships with climatefriendly companies may not be effective in protecting key from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior the increased use of remote work infrastructure has expanded potential attack vectors and resulted in increased operational risks the increase in remote work over the past several years has resulted in an expanded potential attack surface and heightened operational risks and may negatively impact our ability and the ability of our thirdparty service providers including their downstream service providers to perform services efficiently securely and without interruptions in addition to some of our workforce working remotely periodically or on a fulltime basis our thirdparty service providers including their downstream service providers may utilize personnel who work remotely increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities for example cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to compromise business emails including by targeting employees through an increase of phishing attempts and fraudulent calls including through the use of artificial intelligence these fraudulent activities have resulted in increased fraud losses to us and the financial services industry generally in addition to enhanced cybersecurity risk employees and other personnel performing services for us who work remotely may experience disruptions to their home internet or phone connections decreased efficiency due to delayed network speeds or other interruptions andor delays in the dissemination and exchange of information any of which could negatively impact our operations we have experienced and may continue to experience disruption related to remote work which disruptions could adversely impact our business and could result in legal liability regulatory penalties litigation expenses remediation costs or reputational harm iv liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by banking regulations require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our table of contents regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that apply to us see the section titled regulatory capital requirements under the heading supervision and regulation in item of this report regulatory capital standards require key to maintain significant amounts of highquality capital eg common equity and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition regulatory liquidity standards require us to hold highquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits further the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these processes the severity and other characteristics of which may evolve from yeartoyear are used by the federal reserve to among other things evaluate our management of capital and the adequacy of our regulatory capital and to determine the stress capital buffer that we must maintain above our minimum regulatory capital requirements the results of these processes are difficult to predict due to among other things the federal reserves use of proprietary stress models that differ from our internal models and may result in the federal reserve imposing capital requirements in excess of our expectations which could require us as applicable to revise our stresstesting or capital management approaches resubmit our capital plan or postpone cancel or alter our planned capital actions the results may also lead to limits on keys ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares in addition certain regulatory rule changes related to tailoring outlined in the egrrcpa were finalized in while marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to key such as relief from lcr disclosure requirements overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future moreover key has not experienced significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of these final rules on july the federal reserve fdic and occ issued a proposal to implement the basel committees basel iii regulatory capital framework and substantially revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations those with billion or more in total assets such as key and to banking organizations with significant trading activity for more information on the proposal see the section titled regulatory capital requirements under the heading supervision and regulation in item of this report if implemented as proposed the proposed rule would significantly increase capital requirements applicable to key and many activities in which key engages federal agencies actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us the federal government in recent years has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example in march the federal reserve initiated a round of emergency interest rate cuts designed to mitigate some of the economic effects resulting from the pandemic and subsequently began raising interest rates in march in an effort to combat inflation these initiatives have impacted financial markets and our business and caused increased market and interest rate volatility higher debt yields an inverted slope to the yield curve and unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns in early a series of bank failures including svb and signature lead the us treasury secretary the fdic and the federal reserve to invoke the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution requirement under the fdia to guarantee uninsured deposits of the failed banks the systemic bank exception can only be invoked for financial market risks that pose a threat to financial stability as discussed under the section entitled fdia resolution authority and financial stability in supervision and regulation in item of this report the fdic imposed a special assessment on idis to recover the loss to the dif resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of svb and signature the impact of the special assessment to key is approximately million which was recognized in the fourth quarter of and impacted noninterest expense for that quarter in addition rating agencies reacted to the volatility caused by the bank failures by issuing updated table of contents ratings and assessments for numerous us banks including key as discussed below under our credit ratings affect our liquidity position following these immediate responses regulators have issued a number of nprs and proposed guidance and promised to adopt further measures designed to strengthen capital and liquidity standards and restore confidence in the banking system applicable to key including those discussed in regulatory capital requirements under the heading supervision and regulation in item of this report these final and proposed rules if implemented and any related proposal that may be put forward including regarding liquidity could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations capital and longterm debt requirements require us to divert resources from otherwise profitable lending and investment opportunities to ensure compliance which may be dilutive to shareholders or limit keys ability to buy back shares or issue dividends further as market conditions evolve and respond to the influence of these government agency initiatives or lack thereof the slope of the yield curve will shift and influence our loan and deposit rates and value of investments the actions of federal agencies are not fully predictable which contributes to market volatility and changes to the slope of the yield curve we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorps largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see supervision and regulation in item of this report in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs our credit ratings affect our liquidity position the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank the ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings for instance in rating agencies reacted to the volatility in the banking industry by issuing updated ratings and assessments for numerous us banks including key among the rating agencies moodys standard poors and fitch ratings inc each downgraded keycorps and keybanks longterm debt ratings the rationales for the downgrades which are documented in the table of contents agencies respective credit opinions and analyses included a challenging environment for the entire banking industry along with other companyspecific factors we may be unable to maintain our current ratings and our ratings may be downgraded again in the future the impact of the recent downgrades to keycorps or keybanks credit ratings or further downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income if future reductions placed on keycorps or keybanks credit ratings result in belowinvestment grade ratings it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase our costs under such arrangements v market risk a worsening of the us economy and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets a worsening of economic and market conditions or downside shocks could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry recent and persistent interest rate increases and a slowing economy have presented a challenge for the industry including key and affected business and financial performance in particular we face the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors placing pressure on the price of keys common shares decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key or leading to an increase in depositors withdrawing funds a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults a decrease in household or corporate incomes reducing demand for keys products and services a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to keys borrowers or a decrease in the quality of keys loan portfolio increasing loan chargeoffs and reducing keys net income a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally and those of our transaction counterparties specifically a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other issuers whose securities we hold and an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key in the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business there can be no assurance that the federal government and the federal reserve would intervene or make adjustments to fiscal or monetary policy that would cause business and economic conditions to improve a worsening of business and economic conditions or market volatility related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation which has recently led to increased costs for businesses and consumers and caused the federal reserve to initiate a series of interest rate increases may enhance or contribute to some of the risks of our business by adversely affecting the creditworthiness of our borrowers increasing our costs or resulting in lower values for our investment securities and other fixedrate assets to the extent that the federal reserves policies around managing inflation do not mitigate the volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation or to the extent conditions otherwise worsen we could experience adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory table of contents agencies in particular the federal reserve our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related onand offbalance sheet exposures and the cost of any such hedging activity can significantly influence the success of our assetandliability management activities and the resulting level of our net interest income and net interest margin changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities when the federal reserve raises or reduces interest rates the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of benchmark rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin in addition our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings the impact of interest rates on our investment portfolio and consolidated financial results including aoci can also affect our ability to maintain our capital ratios within our target ranges as well as the amount and timing of our future share repurchases and dividends for additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business refer to the information included under the caption risk management market risk management in item of this report our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and in certain market segments in which we conduct significant business we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint economic growth in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and the health of the overall us economy may differ from the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters impact of public health crises or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare finance and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments an economic downturn or recession in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds insurance companies and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other financial institutions this phenomenon was evident following the bank failures in early as financial institutions like us were impacted by concerns regarding the soundness or creditworthiness of other financial institutions those events caused substantial and cascading table of contents disruption within the financial markets and adversely impacted the market price and volatility of our common stock in addition many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our loan or derivatives exposure there can be no assurance that any such losses would not adversely and materially affect our results of operations depressed market values for our common stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require us to write down all or some portion of our goodwill as of december the book value of our goodwill was billion goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired the fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting units expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic regulatory and legislative changes a significant decline in a reporting units expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to be below its carrying amount resulting in goodwill impairment if an impairment loss is recorded it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or on our regulatory capital levels but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce our earnings see the critical accounting policies section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional information vi reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly impact our business and major stakeholders our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highly skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation damage to our reputation could also adversely impact our credit ratings and access to capital markets significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including inappropriate behavior or misconduct of employees actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes inadequate or ineffective risk management practices failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality corporate governance and regulatory compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals including financial and esgrelated commitments the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors and actions taken by shareholder activists and community organizations additionally actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry as well as legislative or regulatory actions that target or negatively impact the industry may also have a significant adverse effect on our reputation negative coverage about key published in traditional media or on social media websites whether or not factually correct may affect our reputation and our business prospects and impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation thereby increasing the potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate false misleading or other negative information that could damage our reputation negative public opinion can also adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customer relationships and could subject us to litigation and regulatory action we are also subject to the risk that disruptions to how our customers access our banking services such as disruptions to our technology platforms eg online banking websites or mobile applications or other impacts to our branches could harm our reputation with customers in particular a cybersecurity event impacting key or our customers data or personal information could negatively impact our reputation and customer confidence in key and our data security procedures we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses and could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions table of contents key is subject to environmental social and governance esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation the trading price of our common stock andor our business and results of operations views about esgrelated issues are diverse dynamic and rapidly changing financial services companies including key face increasing criticism from social and environmental activists who target companies including key for engaging in business with clients engaged in industries such activists perceive to be harmful to communities or the environment such criticism directed at key could generate dissatisfaction among our stakeholders additionally however we respond to such criticism we face the risk that current or potential clients may decline to do business with us or current or potential employees refuse to work with us this can be true regardless of whether we are perceived by some as not having done enough to address activist concerns or by others as having inappropriately yielded to activist pressures conversely certain states have taken and may in the future take actions or proposed measures to limit the states ability to do business with financial institutions or other businesses identified as discriminating against certain industries or practices based on environmental or social criteria we could be inherently exposed to reputational financial and legal risk and our ability to retain and attract customers and employees may be negatively impacted as a result of these contrasting arguments in how a financial institution should address these issues companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders related to their esg practices and disclosures we may face criticism or a loss of confidence with accompanying reputational risk from our perceived action or inaction to deliver on our esgrelated commitments investors and other stakeholders including us institutional investors are increasingly considering how corporations are incorporating esg matters including climate change into their business strategy when analyzing the expected risk and return of potential investments the specific esg factors considered as well as the approach to incorporating the factors into a broader investment process vary by investor and can shift over time these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of keycorps common stock if investors determine that key has not made sufficient progress on esg matters or is not aligned with the investors esgrelated priorities in addition collecting measuring and reporting esg information and metrics can be costly difficult and time consuming is subject to evolving reporting standards and can present numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risks any of which could have a material impact on key including on keys reputation further inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could result in potential liability related to such information vii strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitability acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships effectively managing risk and rewards maintaining financial strength and engaging retaining and inspiring our diverse and highperforming workforce the success of these initiatives can be subject to changes in the macroeconomic environment that are beyond our control in addition our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities or to do so in the expected timeframe may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability we operate in a highly competitive industry we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks including large technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural customer preference and technological changes our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by table of contents our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability strategic risk may also be realized due to events or issues that materialize in other risk factor areas for example significant deficiencies in endtoend operational execution andor product delivery or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in unmet client expectations or harm and impact our competitive standing in the industry maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive products and services the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices equal to or lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop a talented and diverse workforce competition for talent in our business is strong and requires us to make investments to provide compensation and benefits at market levels rising wages as well as inflation may cause us to increase these investments such investments cause compensation and benefits to represent our greatest expense additionally we increasingly compete for talent outside of the core financial services industry nonfinancial institutions may be subject to different pay and hiring expectations than us which may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified teammates for example we are required to deliver a substantial portion of the variable compensation of certain teammates in the form of awards tied to our financial performance the decline in our share price we experienced in could impact our ability to retain those individuals similarly our pay practices are subject to scrutiny by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive pay to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service industry competitors finally while remote work opportunities allow us to hire outside of our traditional footprint it also increases competition these factors individually or collectively may constrain our ability to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees which could impact our ability to serve our customers and clients acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our managements time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting table of contents systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction viii model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions we use quantitative models to help provide value input into the management of certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including but not limited to estimating cecl measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the capital stress testing process models are simplified representations of realworld relationships thus our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and available data these assumptions provide only reasonable not absolute estimates particularly in times of market distress when historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution models can also produce inadequate estimates due to errors in computer code use of unsuitable data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses we have an enterprisewide model risk management program designed to accurately identify measure report monitor and manage model risk the management of model risk includes independent validation and model governance establishing and monitoring model control standards and model risk metrics and completeness and accuracy of the inventory of models banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators table of contents
