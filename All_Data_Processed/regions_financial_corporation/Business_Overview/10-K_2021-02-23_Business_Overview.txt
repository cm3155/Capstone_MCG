consequently we are also subject to the nyses rules for listed companies in october the federal reserve and the other federal bank regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity regulations to bhcs and depository institutions per the egrrcpa amendments the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each us bhc with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators crossjurisdictional activity wstwf nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure and status as a us gsib under the tailoring rules regions and regions bank are each subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii firms subject to category iv standards are generally subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with less than billion in total consolidated assets but are among other things subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and also required to monitor and report certain riskbased indicators accordingly under the tailoring rules category iv firms are among other things not subject to lcr requirements or in certain cases subject to reduced requirements no longer subject to companyrun capital stress testing requirements subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements regions cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies including any changes resulting from the recent change in us presidential administration yet such changes may have a material impact on regions business financial condition or results of operations we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others permissible activities under the bhc act in general the bhc act limits the activities permissible for bhcs to the business of banking managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto a bhc electing to be treated as a fhc like regions may also engage in a range of activities that are i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or ii complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally these activities include securities dealing underwriting and market making insurance underwriting and agency activities merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments for a bhc to be eligible to elect fhc status all of its subsidiary insured depository institutions must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged as described below under regulatory remedies under the fdia and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institutions most recent examination under the cra the bhc itself must also be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in order to be eligible to elect fhc status if an fhc fails to continue to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged after engaging in activities not permissible for bhcs that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies the company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements if the company does not return to compliance within days the federal reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bhc electing to be treated as an fhc furthermore if the federal reserve determines that an fhc has not maintained a cra rating of at least satisfactory the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible nonbanking activities of bhcs the federal reserve has the power to order any bhc or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the federal reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bhc capital requirements regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve which are based on the basel iii framework the basel iiibased us capital rules among other things impose a capital measure called common equity tier capital or cet1 capital to which most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made in addition the basel iiibased us capital rules specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain specified requirements under the us basel iiibased capital rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the leverage ratio the us capital rules previously imposed a ccb of on top of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above for all banking organizations subject to the rule on march the federal reserve approved a final rule designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of the capital plans of bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets such as regions with the ccb requirement details of this final rule are discussed under comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing below regions and regions bank are subject to the final rule adopted by the federal reserve occ and fdic in july relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to nonadvanced approaches banking organizations these rules became effective for the company on april and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us basel iii rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to regions or regions bank the impact of basel iv will depend on the manner in which it is implemented in the us with respect to firms such as regions and regions bank for more information see the regulatory requirements section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k leverage requirements bhcs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements these requirements provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total consolidated average tangible assets as defined for regulatory purposes called the leverage ratio of for all bhcs liquidity requirements under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in wstwf including regions and regions bank are no longer subject to an lcr requirement or the recently finalized nsfr requirement however bhcs that are category iv firms remain subject to minimum liquidity buffers and liquidity stress testing requirements under the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards though the minimum frequency of such testing was revised to quarterly under the tailoring rules rather than monthly the tailoring rules also adjusted liquidity risk management requirements such that category iv firms are required to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are required to continue reporting liquidity data on the fr on a monthly basis comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing the federal reserve currently conducts analyses of bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the firms have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic conditions under the tailoring rules category iv firms including regions are now subject to supervisory stress testing every other year rather than annually and are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements but remain subject to required annual capital plan submissions and to certain fr y14 reporting requirements us bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as regions must annually develop and maintain a capital plan and must submit the capital plan to the federal reserve as part of the federal reserves ccar process the ccar process is intended to help ensure that these bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress on january the federal reserve finalized a rule that further tailors the capital planning requirements applicable to category iv firms on march the federal reserve approved a final rule designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement the final rule replaces the current static percent ccb with an scb requirement the scb reflects capital degradation in the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and also includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends the scb is however subject to a minimum of percent in addition the final rule eliminates the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but requires a bhc to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bhcs own baseline scenario projections on august the federal reserve announced that regions initial scb would be percent although the final rule replaces the static ccb requirement with one based on the results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests firms continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the scb is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the extent to which capital distributions will be constrained depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income which is defined under an august final rule as the greater of a banking institutions net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions to shareholders and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and the average of a banking institutions net income over the preceding four quarters for further information see the regulatory requirements section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k as part of the january final rule discussed above the federal reserve finalized revisions to the scb requirements that are applicable to category iv bhcs to align with the twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bhcs under the final rule for category iv bhcs the portion of the scb requirement that reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests is calculated every other year during a year in which a category iv bhc does not undergo a supervisory stress test the bhc will receive an updated scb requirement that reflects the bhcs updated planned common stock dividends a category iv bhc is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the bhc would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated scb requirement under the march final rule implementing the scb a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan the federal reserve announced on june that all bhcs participating in ccar would be required to update and resubmit their capital plans in light of the economic uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic at the same time the federal reserve announced that for the third quarter of it would generally require those bhcs to suspend share repurchases limit common stock dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter of and limit common stock dividend payments to an amount based on average net income for the four preceding quarters on september the federal reserve extended these measures for the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the release of the results from the federal reserves review of capital plan resubmissions and a second round of stress testing the federal reserve announced on december that it would extend the distribution limitations to the first quarter of subject to adjustment requiring that common stock dividend payments and share repurchases be limited to an amount not in excess of average net income over the four preceding quarters provided that common stock dividend payments remain limited to the amount paid in the second quarter of the federal reserve did not initially adjust scbs based on the results of the second round of stress testing but maintained the right to do so through march resolution planning pursuant to the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bhcs are required to submit resolution plans to the federal reserve and fdic providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure however in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules in october which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv firms such as regions are no longer required to submit resolution plans in april the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions such as regions bank in january the fdic announced that given the passage of time from the last resolution plan submissions and the uncertain economic outlook the fdic will resume requiring resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets including regions bank the fdic indicated that no insured depository institution will be required to submit a resolution plan without at least months advance notice but did not otherwise provide notice of when regions bank will be required to submit its next resolution plan safety and soundness standards the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and the federal banking agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed generally subject to a narrow exception the fdia requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized as of december both regions and regions bank were wellcapitalized an institution that is classified as wellcapitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized respectively if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the fdia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards regulators also must take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institutions assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its offbalance sheet position and iii risks from nontraditional activities as well as an institutions ability to manage those risks when determining the adequacy of an institutions capital regulators make this evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institutions safety and soundness additionally regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions payment of dividends we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries the principal source of cash flow to us including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt is dividends from regions bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us as well as by us to our shareholders if in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such agency may require after notice and hearing that such institution cease and desist from such practice the federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institutions capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdia an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized see safety and soundness standards above moreover the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements stating that bhcs and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings payment of dividends by regions bank under the federal reserves regulation h regions bank may not without approval of the federal reserve declare or pay a dividend to regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of a regions banks net income for that year and b its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to additional paidin capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock under alabama law regions bank may not pay a dividend in excess of of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least of capital regions bank is also required by alabama law to seek the approval of the alabama superintendent of banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by regions bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of a regions banks net earnings for that year plus b its retained net earnings for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses actual losses accrued dividends on preferred stock if any and all federal state and local taxes regions bank cannot without approval from the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent of banking declare or pay a dividend to regions unless regions bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above payment of dividends by regions our payment of dividends to our shareholders is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bhc such as regions are reviewed by the federal reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and stress tests as submitted by the bhc as discussed above the federal reserve has limited dividend payments and share repurchases for the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of in response to the economic uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic see capital requirements and comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing above support of subsidiary banks under longstanding federal reserve policy which has been codified by the doddfrank act regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when regions may not be inclined to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bhc to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions with affiliates sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates including a parent bhc regions bank is subject to these restrictions which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place including extensions of credit to affiliates investments in the stock or securities of affiliates purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates these restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank generally a banks covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus deposit insurance regions bank accepts deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency regions bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on an assessment rate established by the fdic fdic assessment rates for large institutions with more than billion in assets such as regions bank are calculated based on a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs based primarily on the institutions assessment base which is primarily the difference between average total assets and average tangible equity the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that may not be adequately captured in the scorecard for large institutions including regions bank after accounting for potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate that is applied to an institutions calculated assessment base could range from to basis points on an annualized basis for more information see the fdic insurance assessments section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k acquisitions the bhc act requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution ii it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc fhcs must obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion fhcs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the us or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bhcs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties performance under the cra the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering in addition pursuant to the doddfrank act the bhc act was amended to require the federal reserve to when evaluating a proposed transaction consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system depositor preference under federal law claims of depositors and certain claims for both administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the volcker rule the final rules implementing the volcker rule also require that large bhcs such as regions design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rules prohibitions development and monitoring of the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and management attention in october the federal reserve occ fdic cftc and sec finalized rules to tailor the application of the volcker rule based on the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions requirements and exemptions on june these regulators approved a final rule with respect to the implementing regulations relating to covered funds including changes to the definition of covered fund and the prohibitions on certain covered transactions consumer protection laws we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective state law counterparts the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above other fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws for depository institutions with billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products financial privacy and cybersecurity the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is used in diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions a financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institutions operations after a cyberattack a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyberattack the regions information security program reflects the requirements of this guidance in addition on december the federal banking regulators proposed a new cybersecurityrelated notification rule that would require banking organizations including regions and regions bank to notify their primary federal regulator promptly of the occurrence of certain significant computersecurity incidents the proposed rule would also impose requirements on bank service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of certain computersecurity incidents state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements for example the california consumer privacy act became effective on january and in november california voters approved the california privacy rights act we expect this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located community reinvestment act regions bank is subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra regions bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institutions record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including low and moderateincome neighborhoods the regulatory agencys assessment is part of the federal reserves consideration of applications by a bank or bhc to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bhc applicant the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bhc and such records may be the basis for denying the application in april the us department of treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the cras implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks subsequently in december the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to update and modernize the cras implementing regulations on may the occ finalized its rule while the fdic which had joined the occs proposed rulemaking did not proceed with a final rule the federal reserve which did not join the occ and fdics proposal in october put forth its own advance notice of proposed rulemaking focused on cra modernization we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra regions banks most recent cra rating from the federal reserve is satisfactory compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve the federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness antimoney laundering a continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act broadened the application of antimoney laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as brokerdealers investment advisors and insurance companies and strengthened the ability of the us government to help prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions including state member banks i establish an antimoney laundering program that includes training and audit components ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account iii take additional required precautions with nonus owned accounts and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot acts requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution regions banking subsidiary has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update their policies procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations the usa patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition in january the amla which amends the bsa was enacted the amla is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize us antimoney laundering laws among other things the amla codifies a riskbased approach to antimoney laundering compliance for financial institutions requires the development of standards by the us department of the treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for bsa compliance and expands enforcement and investigationrelated authority including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain bsa violations many of the statutory provisions in the amla will require additional rulemaking reports and other measures and the impact of the amla will depend on among other things rulemaking and implementation guidance fincen which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs office of foreign assets control regulation the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the ofac rules

securities llc are registered brokerdealers with the sec and finra and regions investment management inc and highland associates inc are registered investment advisers with the sec these subsidiaries are as a result subject to regulation and examination by the sec finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers and investment advisers competition all aspects of our business are highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries such as savings and loan associations credit unions internet banks finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage and investment banking firms mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations we expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies given the low interest rate and slower economic environment also future changes in monetary policy coupled with postcrisis regulatory requirements may increase competition for certain deposit products our success will depend in part on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services further we expect consolidation in the financial services industry to continue which may produce larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer traditional bank or banklike products and services and therefore compete with financial institutions like us in providing electronic internetbased and mobile phonebased financial solutions in particular the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow a number of fintechs have applied for and in some cases been granted bank or industrial loan charters while other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers in addition to fintechs traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers although providing digital products and services has been important to serving customers and competing in the financial services industry for some time the covid19 pandemic has further accelerated the move towards digital banking and financial services and we expect a banks digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator beyond the covid19 pandemic the move toward digital banking and financial services and customer expectations regarding digital offerings will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements customers for banking services and other financial services offered by our subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience quality of service price of service personal contacts the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience and availability of products although our position varies in different markets we believe that our affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas human capital one pillar of our strategic priorities at regions is the commitment to build the best team we believe one of the biggest differentiators of our performance is the people we employ the need to attract retain and develop the right talent to accomplish our strategic plan is central to our success as of
