management framework and a disciplined dynamic approach to managing concentration risk which has positioned us well to weather any economic environment and continue to deliver consistent sustainable longterm performance now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans grew while ending loans grew during the quarter average business loans increased reflecting broadbased growth across all businesses and industries a majority of the growth this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and to expand their businesses while still below prepandemic levels commercial line utilization ended the quarter at approximately increasing basis points over the prior quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 loan production also remained strong with linkedquarter commitments up approximately billion importantly digging into this commercial loan growth were maintaining a very high asset quality portfolio in fact balances considered investmentgrade equivalent are up compared to a year ago and approximately of our total commitments are also considered investmentgrade equivalent representing its highest level on record similarly our overall probability of default in this portfolio has improved approximately basis points since mid of average consumer loans remained relatively stable while ending loans increased growth in average mortgage and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories within other consumer enerbank loans grew approximately compared to the first quarter as a reminder enerbank has a track record of wellcontrolled loss rates throughout multiple cycles and primarily originates prime and super prime loans to homeowners who tend to be lowerrisk borrowers looking forward we currently expect to hold total loans relatively stable over the remainder of the year which would result in full year average loan growth of approximately compared to this assumes a slowing rate of growth compared to the second quarter but also assumes increased capital markets activity in the back half of the year so lets turn to deposits deposit balances acquired throughout the pandemic remain mostly stable early in the feds tightening cycle importantly seasonal patterns related primarily to income tax payments returned to those experienced prior to the pandemic while average deposit balances grew ending balances declined ending consumer deposits were mostly stable while corporate and wealth management balances decreased approximately billion each in addition to seasonal patterns and in line with our expectations the declines also include certain commercial and wealth clients beginning to reduce some of their excess balances we continue to expect a range of billion to billion of overall balance reduction for the full year of resulting from tightening monetary policy the combination of our legacy deposit base along with the more stable components of surge deposits represents a significant opportunity for us as rates continue to increase lets shift to net interest income and margin net interest income grew million or linked quarter evidencing strong balance sheet growth and asset sensitivity in a rising interest rate environment cash averaged billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced second quarters reported margin by basis points our adjusted margin was the reduction in cash this quarter resulted mostly from strong asset growth both loans and securities as well as seasonal deposit outflows average loan balances grew billion or in the second quarter additionally billion of securities were added the recent increase in rates have certainly validated our decision to wait on a better rate environment to deploy cash into securities while not included in our current outlook additional security purchases would provide incremental benefit the primary driver of net interest income growth this quarter was higher interest rates and our decision to remain exposed to rates in the near term importantly deposit balance and yield outperformance including a cycle to date deposit beta allowed net interest income to grow by more than our previous guidance total net interest income is projected to increase to in the third quarter as expectations for rate hikes have been pulled forward so has our outlook for nii fourth quarter net interest income is now expected to be approximately to higher than our first quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 regions balance sheet remains wellpositioned to benefit from continuing increases in interest rates incremental 25basispoint increases in the fed funds rate are projected to add between million and million over a full 12month period as deposit betas are projected to increase into the to range this nii benefit is supported by a large portion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash which compares favorably to the industry overall over a longer horizon a more normal interest rate environment or roughly a to fed funds rate will support a net interest margin range of approximately to this target incorporates the execution of recent hedging activity at higher rate levels than originally contemplated while we have purposefully retained leverage to the higher interest rates during a period of low rates we have begun to manage to a more normal interest rate risk profile as the interest rate environment normalizes this includes the addition of billion of forward starting receive fix swaps and a billion of spot starting securities during the quarter through the first half of we have added billion of swaps and securities the swaps become effective in the latter half of and and have a term of generally three years this represents approximately of the total hedging amount expected this cycle with the sizable amount of hedging complete we will balance market rate levels and potential risk as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased from the prior quarter primarily due to improvement in capital markets and card and atm fees within capital markets growth was driven by higher fees and ma advisory and real estate loan syndications as well as a million benefit from cva and dva we continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of million to million excluding the impact of cva and dva while we expect to be on the lower end of the range next quarter we do anticipate activity will pick up in the coming quarters card and atm fees reflect seasonally higher interchange on both debit and credit cards spend was up yearoveryear as inflation has impacted several categories including a increase in fuel while discretionary categories such as retail goods department stores and apparel are actually down mortgage and wealth management income remained relatively stable during the quarter despite unfavorable conditions seasonally higher mortgage production overcame first quarter gains associated with the sale of previously repurchased ginnie mae loans while we anticipate a decline in mortgage income relative to mortgage as well as wealth management will remain key contributors to our overall fee revenue service charges declined during the quarter as seasonal increases were offset by nsf and overdraft policy changes the second phase of previously announced nsf and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end of the second quarter and the remaining changes will be implemented in the third quarter these changes when combined with previously implemented changes are expected to result in full year service charges of approximately million we also expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in and now expect full year service charges of approximately million we expect adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to the prior year driven primarily by growth in net interest income this growth includes the impact of lower ppp related revenue and the anticipated impact of nsf and overdraft changes regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior quarter salaries and benefits increased primarily due to annual merit increases which became effective on april higher variablebased and incentive compensation associated with increased financial performance and better credit experience as well as one additional workday in the quarter these increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll taxes and lower hr asset valuations we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business as a result our core expense base will grow we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to importantly this includes the full year impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts with the changes in revenue and expense guidance we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately in overall credit performance remained strong annualized net chargeoffs decreased basis points to basis points nonperforming loans increased modestly during the quarter but remained below prepandemic levels at basis points of total loans while business services criticized loans and total delinquencies continue to improve provision expense was million this quarter and included a modest build to our allowance for credit losses attributable primarily to strong loan growth and to a limited degree general macroeconomic uncertainty as well as some early signs of normalization within select commercial sectors our allowance for credit loss ratio is of total loans while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains very strong at our annualized yeartodate net chargeoff ratio is basis points given increasing expectations for a slowing economy combined with inevitable normalization we are maintaining our full year net chargeoff expectations in the to 30basispoint range but currently expect to be towards the lower end based on the recent stress test results our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of is expected to remain at once our supervisory results are confirmed in august of we ended the quarter with our common equity tier ratio at an estimated reflecting continued strong loan growth particularly during the last week of the quarter and while loan growth remains our top priority for capital deployment we expect to manage to the midpoint of our to operating range over time also as john mentioned our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of per share an increase over the prior quarter which reflects strong earnings growth so wrapping up on the next slide our updated expectations which weve already addressed in closing we have delivered strong yeartodate performance despite volatile economic conditions we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers but also remain vigilant with respect to any indicators of potential market contraction pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit risk is relatively benign and capital and liquidity are solid with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks good morning i wanted to start off on the net interest income just based on the guidance it looks like its going to end the year about billion so the question is if the fed were to stop raising rates at year end it seems like you have a lot of strong momentum for growth into next year could you just talk about some of the big picture trends that you see for next year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah sure peter this is david so we do have an expectation that fed continues to raise rates probably finishing the year in a to range and they could go past that they could stay there for a while we do believe theres risk that the economy slows to a point where they have to become more accommodative in the latter part of and hence why you started to see us place some forward starting swaps in those positions to protect us to the extent that that happens clearly rates could not come down and they may stay flat or go even higher but at that point were generating the kind of nim that we talked about thats on our slide i dont have the page number but a very strong net interest margin and more importantly a very good return on tangible common equity profile so the benefit is through our deposit base we think were going to continue to have a lower beta through the cycle than our peers it may be higher than last time for everybody but nonetheless we think thats our competitive advantage even if the fed stops at year end without any further increases peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and then just as a followup just could you give a little bit more color on the loan growth guidance in the second half of the year with it slowing it just surprised given the momentum on the periodend basis david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so one we have to acknowledge we had pretty strong loan growth i think the industry had pretty good loan growth in the first quarter obviously things are slowing down a bit we think were going to have a lot of opportunity to grow but this is when you need to be very cautious very careful and make sure your client selectivity is robust and ensure that you get paid for the risks that youre taking and so we may be a little conservative in terms of our loan balances from here on out what we wanted to make sure is we dont want to send the message that were going to grow at the pace we just did the first quarter we dont think that would be appropriate for us we still see good demand in a lot of sectors financial services utilities wholesale durables just to name and elements of transportation are strong and we think even in investor real estate there are some places that weve been able to grow in the multifamily sector in regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 particular as well as in the in industrial area so i think its a bit of cautious tone is all were sending and we will grow as the market gives us permission with the right metrics john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp peter this is john the other thing i would add is that all the volatility has obviously created disruption in the capital markets and so weve seen particularly our larger customers rely on the pro rata bank market for funding at some point we expect a little more clarity about the path of the economy and so we believe that what is pentup demand amongst issuers will theyll begin to access the capital markets again which will result in some paydowns in some of the larger credit exposure that we have enjoyed over the last two or three quarters so that is part of our projection as well and as david said it may be a conservative point of view but we believe it will happen at some point in the next few quarters peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking the question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess david just following up on your comment around the margin i think you mentioned if i heard you correctly a to normalized margin for regions one i mean if you could tell us like what the fed funds needs to get to in order for you to get to that level for the net interest margin and once we get there based on the hedging strategy that you have what youve laid out do you think that becomes something thats relatively stable absent a big change in the rate backdrop and obviously the protection that you have on the downside david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so if you look at our slide deck on page we try to lay that out that gives you at least some parameters on where we think the margin could be in different scenarios so if the feds going to get close to at the end of the day and stay there for a while we think we can have a margin profile thats in that range and if the fed doesnt move any further or doesnt reverse course and come back the other way thats probably where well be if the fed starts to come the other way our margin will decline some but we think we can protect regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 today we can protect about as rates continue to move up and we finish our hedging program were about three quarters of the way through and we have another to do if were patient enough and we kind of understand where the economy is going perhaps we can lock in a downside protection a bit higher than the and thats really what our goal is and we think is a great level today but can we get another few basis points on top of that if were patient we think so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i think just tied to that you mentioned deposit betas for this the core customer base could be higher relative to the last cycle im wondering if anything that youve seen so far in the last two to four weeks that would imply that customers conversations around higher rates have picked up and you could actually see a higher beta this cycle versus last david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well so the answer to that is no weve been a bit surprised frankly on both betas as well as balances but for the industry so our beta cumulative beta thus far is were one of the lowest peer group i think as the median is about double that so i we keep calling for deposit balances to decline some billion to billion the largest contributor of that would be corporate deposits that are going we believe in time seek a higher return we are starting to see that pick up a bit again were surprised that it hadnt moved quicker but if fed moved basis points in their next move in september yeah in september im sorry at the end of end of july this month and an expectation of another in september then we think those balances will start to move off balance sheet and frankly were going to help facilitate that for our customers because we can earn a little bit of a fee on that and give them a better return today thats happened some already so if you look at corporate customers they actually have either deposit balances with us or off balance sheet that weve helped facilitate and if you add those two together actually a little higher than they were at yearend so weve been pleased with our deposit base and our betas thus far ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good color thank you so much john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning bill regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning good morning youve all proven yourselves to be astute managers of risk id love to hear how youre thinking about the risk that the strength we continue to see in labor markets and you mentioned the balances in consumer accounts and strong liquidity and spending in general and to the extent to which all of that is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the fed to have to do more so everything seems great now but we all know the hiking cycle works on a significant lag and we could see unemployment continue to rise well after the last fed hike and weve started to see initial claims creep up a little bit so maybe if you could just reinforce how that dynamic even though youre not seeing it at the micro level yet perhaps how that if at all impacts the actions that youre taking today across the business david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah bill its a great question and its one we challenge ourselves with constantly as a team in our discussions with others in the industry including our regulatory supervisors and the fed in particular about where they really want to go i think we all believe theres an expectation of getting to neutral as fast as they can is what they would like to do but i think every time theres a move theres a need to pause and see what impact thats going to have on the economy we do have inflation that can get addressed by slowing the economy down which is taking effect now but as much as they want to get to neutral that i dont think the fed wants to wreck the economy either so what were trying to do is read all the tea leaves look at all the data that we can study our customers whether it be consumers or corporate customers to try and get an understanding of what theyre thinking how their business is how theyre managing their personal money to gather an understanding of the slowdown in the economy and what the fed may or may not do we believe that the feds going to get to to by the end of the year dont know if theyll move exactly like the market thinks but we think thats going to be a place where they likely stop and let things play out over time but we have to be prepared for them to keep going and if thats the case because inflation is not under control there could be some ramifications to that long term which is why were cautious on extending credit while we want to manage our bank as efficiently as we can because you have to have scenarios for anything that could possibly happen as we seek to continue to have appropriate returns on capital to our shareholders bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color and very helpful response thank you if i may follow up on enerbank can you remind us how growth math dynamics impact enerbank whats the interplay between the need to build reserves and the strong loan growth that youre seeing versus the timing of the revenue benefits and then more broadly if you could also speak to the trajectory of the reserve rate from here david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay ill start on enerbank so enerbank we said represented of an industry that was about billion so call that billion of annual production for them that generates growth in the double digits weve seen that play out we dont think about the provisioning getting ahead of the earnings because if we did that we would not make any loans ever thats why its a terrible standard but i wont go into that it is what it is regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 so what we want to do is be there for our clients to extend credit regards to the fact that we have to set up a reserve in advance so then come into play weve had nice growth with enerbank and very excited about that get paid for the risk were taking and its worked exactly like we thought it would be john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp he asked about the growth math component of our return is fee versus interest income how has that that was his question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah well primarily the youve got carry youve got net interest income as the biggest driver of our profitability there and it comes in two fronts it comes from the customer paying a certain rate and theres a discount from the vendor thats providing the service to the customer an hvac contractor for instance we take those two pieces and thats our yield adjustment now thats should average in the range over time and thats the primary profitability that youll see from enerbank bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful and the broader trajectory of the reserve rate from here that we should be thinking about david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we set the reserves under cecl based on the economic forecast at each quarter end we have to look out through the life of the loan to do that we have a reserve of we think its very robust and based on the risk that we see in the portfolio we feel very good about that the biggest driver of the increase in our reserves this quarter by far was loan growth and so we arent seeing broadbased deterioration in credit at all as a matter of fact we think its actually pretty good we did have an increase in npls primarily attributable to one particular customer but overall we feel really good about credit we do think theres going to be some normalization i mean were at basis points of chargeoffs this quarter thats lower than normal and we think over time it will get back to normal i dont know that it will get there in were forecasting chargeoffs in the range of to basis points and actually towards the lower end of that you could see losses pick up as the economy slows as certain industries start to struggle a bit more than others and i think youll see it manifest itself first in really small businesses thatll have bigger challenges than a larger business and certain consumer groups might struggle more than others bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thank you so much very helpful appreciate your taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi john how are you hi david david can you elaborate a little further on your comments about the capital market fees that you expect to be at the lower end of the range i think you said in your prepared comments in the upcoming quarter what type of capital markets environment are you contemplating for that kind of guidance is it currently what we just had this quarter or is it an improvement and then within the capital markets obviously you guys are not ecm players where are you seeing or you think youre going to see the strength in the upcoming quarters david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think that so we were if you cut out the cvadva were kind of at the lower end of the range we think that thats kind of where well be here at least in the short term capital markets activity is not as robust i think youve seen that play out across the board in particular in the money center banks that have more ecm obviously we dont have that ma advisory and loan syndications are the places where we think can continue to be robust for us and i wish we were going to be at the upper end of that range weve had to revise that down from the beginning of the year a couple of times but we think thats a pretty good really good place to be real estate capital markets and leveraging our sabal capital partners that we bought at the end of last year i think is helping us and but i think we would be remiss if we didnt say thats going to be a little more challenging than we would had hoped just because the capital markets arent quite where we all would like them to be at this point gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question to your comments about the lending the strength of your lending and how you recognize and you guys are very well experienced in handling problems that from the downturn in so nobody expects you to make any errors like that but can you share with us what are you i think you used the word robust in client selection what are you doing at the if we are in an endofthecycle in the economy and thats debatable of course but when you see the growth not just for you but for the industry everybody is showing good loan growth toward the end of maybe as economic expansion how can you reassure us that you guys are got metrics in place that you just wont really have the problems that can be that other banks may run into john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah gerard this is john we learned a lot from that sort of timeframe and particularly the importance of balance and diversity these are good times but you can make your worst loans in the best of times and so were being very thoughtful about what were putting on the books of our new production was to existing customers weve been working very closely with those customers particularly over the last twoanda half years as we worked through the pandemic i think we have a really good sense of whats going on in their businesses regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 we have been focused as you know for a number of years on recycling capital on riskadjusted returns weve been exiting certain portfolios and relationships that didnt generate an appropriate return on capital for us i think thats great discipline that exists within the company we have strong metrics and key performance indicators built around all of our businesses and again really dedication to a strong concentration methodology to ensure that we have good balance and diversity we assume a variety of different scenarios when stress testing credits and stress testing portfolios and as a result we feel good about really good about the credit risk management culture that we have developed over time and think that our portfolios will perform well no matter what the economic conditions or how the economic conditions evolve gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning john good morning david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc david you talked about the billion to billion of potential deposit outflow starting to pick up and if we were to assume they exit over the next quarter or so can you maybe just talk about your expectations for deposit growth and given johns comments regarding what you guys think about loan growth in the second half how do you think about the tradeoff between growing deposits versus optimizing the mix and the cost of deposits david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp so the first part of that we do expect as i mentioned earlier those excess deposits from our corporate clients to seek a better higheryielding home we also have about billion aid in brokered deposits that we picked up regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 from the enerbank transaction so i think that were always looking for quality relationships deposit relationships treasury management relationships we were able to grow that this quarter in treasury management so were excited about that and i think that from a consumer standpoint were in a good part of the country where ought to see better migration of people into our footprint and take and we should be able to take advantage of that so we should be able to continue to grow core checking accounts we do have obviously inflationary pressures on consumers we i think weve put in our slide deck that weve even looked at segmented our deposit base on the consumer side those that had their or less in their checking account prepandemic have six times more cash in their account today than prepandemic now thats going to start declining if inflation continues at a faster clip but continuing to grow customers ought to help us maintain pretty solid deposits our loantodeposit ratio is among the lowest in the peer group at change may be close to and so were optimizing our deposit book were growing deposits as foundational to how we make money and so we are even remotely close to having to worry about wholesale funding there are some of our peers that had to dip into that because of loantodeposit ratio but this is where regions shines this is our competitive advantage is our deposit base and were looking to continue to grow that and grow customers and take care of our customers along the way ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then second david youre targeting basis points of positive operating leverage and i know its early to think about but maybe just to follow up on peters question from earlier if you think about just reaching the nii run rate and assuming no further growth that would give you about revenue growth into next year so how do you think about investing and this obviously is a tricky environment with the potential for an economic slowdown but do you expect that we could potentially see accelerating positive operating leverage in that type of environment david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think you answered that question upfront its a little early to get into but let me help you here we have a continuous improvement program where we are constantly focusing on how to get better at what we do we had a pretty strong efficiency ratio this quarter of call it on an adjusted basis wed like that to be lower were substantially below the median which is basis points higher than we are and i think that at the end of the day if we could get closer to that would be great and were going to figure out how to try and do that we cannot count on revenue growth just being the only driver of how we continue to be efficient so if we stay focused on that ryan i think we can generate pretty solid positive operating leverage now theres a caveat we have to continue to take our winnings if you will and reinvest those in our company to grow that means we have to reinvest in talent we have to reinvest in technology we will reinvest in our transformation that were going to go through on the deposit side primarily and other areas and we do that while continuing to control our cost increases which i told you earlier in the year the vast majority of our increase early in the year was really related to acquisitions so were weve been a good expense managers and i think youll see that continue into regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it ill make sure we ph hold you to that thanks david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp target target operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning and dana great job on slide by the way yeah david i wanted to go back to slide can you audio gap what your plans are for securities book your cash balances from here obviously ph if ioer continues indiscernible to fed funds your cash is going to be working a lot harder by the end of the year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so im glad you pointed that out thats beta on that opportunity there were at on reserves weve been patient with our cash we didnt need to put it in the securities book to help nii we had the benefit of our hedging program doing that for us so we have been patient were glad we have we put a little bit to work in the securities book because the spreads got to a point where it was we were paid for the duration that we were going to take and that securities investment is really part of our hedging program as well we were able to use our cash this quarter to fund all of our loan growth i think were down to call it billion of cash at the end of the quarter and normally that number is going to be million to billion worth of cash at the fed so weve got some of that that we need to hold on to for that deposit outflow that i just talked about whether its the corporate deposits or whether its the enerbankbrokered deposits that well lead over time and regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 then well have some for loan growth so we dont see the need to tap into our alternative sources of funding fhlb and the like or certainly no bank debt issuances are necessary either at this time so weve been cautious its paid off for us i think the securities we invested this quarter yielding ph a 330ish range so and as you could see that in the change in tangible common equity in terms of our decline was much lower than our peers erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so i just wanted to make sure were taking away the right message here from second quarter nim and hit a net interest margin of to right from low higher beta to base case at a fed funds rate of and if the fed starts cutting rates your swap program has protected you to david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats correct erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay and my other question for you david is if we were to prepare for ph a mild recession how should we think about how audio gap more acl builds there may need to be from that david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp so you cut out on the first part of that but i think your question was how do we see the reserve build from here from john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp in a mild recession david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp in a mild recession erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yeah in a mild recession david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so were having to forecast out through life of loan today which has elements of a slowdown already built into it so it really is dependent on how severe it is relative to our expectations already and we kind of went through that i guess in the pandemic you saw our adjustment quickly regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 right now we dont see that changing a lot because we think were covered and the real change to the allowance are just two things whatever chargeoffs have reducing it and then the provision primarily for loan growth which is what you saw this quarter our credit quality metrics are stable netnet all in we feel good about where we are but if the economy starts to slip and were going to have to have higher provisioning going forward erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and every quarter stands on its own so well have to reassess at the end of september erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning just two quick closeouts here just one question david on the ci loan yields just not up as much of course as the nim and im sure some of that is the hedging just wondering if you can kind of just help us understand how much of that is the hedging impact and how much of that might just be mix and pricing et cetera thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i would say most of that is related to hedging our old hedges that we had protecting us those start to roll off we have some still protecting us that they are still in place so were not expanding it quite to pace that maybe others that didnt hedge are but we still have pretty good loan yields netnet and if you look at adjusted net interest income thats after chargeoffs were one of the leaders in the peer group so thats a good indicator telling us were being paid for the credit risk that were taking regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah got it okay and then on capital cet1 youre mentioning you want to get back to the middle of the to and presuming thats to give room for loan growth just wondering obviously that probably implies that no buybacks for now can you just talk us through capital return expectations versus rwa and then also just is it just a little bit more conservatism about the environment all right thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the reason we want to be in that range is to give us flexibility to make investments when we see opportunities in this particular quarter it was loan growth so we had really robust loan growth and you could see our capital our common equity tier declined the primary use of that was in fact rwa growth through the loans were generating call it basis points of common equity tier each quarter or at least we did this past quarter and well use a third of that to pay a dividend and then the rest of its for investment first off its for loan growth weve already sent the message that we dont expect loan growth at the pace we just saw the first quarter we think thatll level off a bit and therefore we can accrete back from the where we are closer to the probably cant get there at the end of the third quarter take us into the fourth quarter but we use share repurchases as the last item to control our capital level we think that still is a great range for us based on the risk we see in our book taking into account all the macro factors that exist today so youll see us accrete up back up towards that before we get into share repurchases ken usdin q analyst jefferies company makes sense thanks david operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi two questions one on the securities book i know we just had a bit of a chat on that but i wanted to understand what the kind of repricing speed is duration like how quickly should we be thinking about the back book migrating to the front book of that you just talked about david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well if you look at allin gross so the i just mentioned was an element of what we invested primarily as part of our hedging program we did have other security purchases so allin yield going on was about thats replacing so were picking up about points on that as we think about duration were looking at call it right at five years today and we dont think that extends a whole lot on us based on what were buying so i think that i think i got what you wanted betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so like roll rate annually regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then on page of the deck you have your base rs economic outlook so is this giving us the base case and then youve got a probability assigned to the base case youve got a probability assigned to the bull and the bear and thats whats feeding into the cecl reserve analysis or would you say this page discloses your probabilityweighted scenario david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we do ours a little different we use a scenario and as our cecl provisioning we do run stress testing obviously using very different scenarios but we dont probabilityweight different things so what youre seeing here on is the driver of our cecl provisioning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay super thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator thank you your final question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan please proceed with your question vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hi vivek john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey vivek morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc morning just a clarification david do you expect your liquid assets to actually go down to million because youre obviously much higher today david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah no vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc but is that realistic or david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no i was saying hypothetically in normal times we could take those down that cash down to a level much lower than the billion that were having that we have today and that would be over time so we wouldnt seek to get there any time soon we want to maintain a lot of liquidity to take care of deposit flows because remember we had some billion worth of growth and what were calling surge deposits and weve made our best estimate as to how we think those things will behave over time and we have about billion billion of it that we think has either a very high beta or its going to seek a better alternative which means we need to have the cash to pay for that if it starts to happen but yeah in normal times we could be down in that ive said somewhere between million to billion and of course then wed have the fhlb as our toggle to take care of other liquidity needs vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and one more which commercial sectors are you seeing early signs of normalization john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp from a credit risk standpoint vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think david talked about small business we have some concern around the transportation particularly on the lower end of the sector where you have transportation companies who are involved in less than truckload hauling and the impact of diesel fuel inflationary cost labor we have been following office for some time and senior housing as well are portfolios that were keeping an eye on i wouldnt say in those two instances that were seeing a normalization but we do have a watchful eye on them regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2022 vivek juneja
