markets revenue through our enhanced risk management framework we delivered our lowest annual net chargeoff ratio since we made investments in key talent and revenuefacing associates to support strategic growth initiatives we continue to grow and diversify revenue through our acquisitions of enerbank sabal capital partners and clearsight advisors we successfully executed our libor transition

associates with the tools they need to be successful we will make incremental adjustments to our business by leaning into our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time as announced earlier this week a key priority in will be additional comprehensive changes to our nsf and overdraft policies which are detailed in the appendix of our presentation these changes represent a natural expansion of our commitment to making banking easier for our customers and complement the enhanced alerts time order posting process as well as our bank on certified checking product we launched late last year its important to note that the financial impact of these enhancements have been fully incorporated in our total revenue expectation for again were pleased with our results and have great momentum as we head into now david will provide you with some select highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet including the impact of acquired loans from the enerbank transaction adjusted average and ending loans grew and respectively during the quarter although business loans continue to be impacted by excess liquidity pipelines have surpassed prepandemic levels and encouragingly we experienced a 240basispoint increase in line utilization rates during the fourth quarter in addition production remained strong with line of credit commitments increasing billion yearoveryear consumer loans reflected the addition of billion of acquired enerbank loans as well as another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest growth in credit card looking forward we expect fullyear reported average loan balances to grow to compared to lets turn to deposits although the pace of deposit growth has slowed balances continue to increase this quarter to new record levels the increase includes the impact of enerbank deposits acquired during the fourth quarter as well as continued growth in new accounts and account balances were continuing to analyze our deposit base and pandemicrelated deposit inflow characteristics in order to predict future deposit behavior based on this analysis we currently believe approximately or billion to billion of deposit increases can be used to support longerterm asset growth through the rate cycle additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet but are likely to be more rate sensitive especially later in the fed cycle while we expect the portion of surge deposits to be rate sensitive you will recall that the granular nature and generally rate insensitive construct of our overall deposit base represents significant upside for us when rates do begin to increase lets shift to net interest income and margin net interest income increased versus the prior quarter driven primarily from our enerbank acquisition favorable ppp income and organic balance sheet growth net interest income from ppp loans increased million from the prior quarter but will be less of a contributor going forward approximately of estimated ppp fees have been recognized regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 cash averaged billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced fourth quarters reported margin by basis points our adjusted margin was modestly higher versus the third quarter excluding the impact of a large third quarter loan interest recovery core net interest income was mostly stable as loan growth offset impacts from the low interest rate environment similar to prior quarters net interest income was reduced by lower reinvestment yields on fixed rate loans and securities these impacts are expected to be more neutral to positive going forward the hedging program contributed meaningfully to net interest income in the fourth quarter the cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately billion roughly of that amount has either been recognized or is locked in the future earnings from hedge terminations excluding ppp net interest income is expected to grow modestly in the first quarter aided by strong fourth quarter ending loan growth as well as continued loan growth in the first quarter partially offset by indiscernible regions balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates over the first basis points of rate tightening each 25basispoint increase in the federal funds rate is projected to add between million and million over a full 12month period this includes recent hedging changes and is supported by a large proportion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash when compared to the industry importantly we continue to shorten the maturity profile of our hedges in the fourth quarter hedging changes to date support increasing net interest income exposure to rising rates positioning us well for higher rates in and beyond in summary net interest income is poised for growth in from balance sheet growth and the higher yield curve in an expanding economy now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to elevated other noninterest income in the third quarter but did not repeat in the fourth quarter organic growth and the integration of sabal capital partners and clearsight advisors will drive growth in capital markets revenue in going forward we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of million to million excluding the impact of cva and dva mortgage income remained relatively stable during the quarter and while we dont anticipate replicating this years performance in mortgage is expected to remain a key contributor to fee revenue particularly as the purchase market in our footprint remains very strong wealth management income increased driven by stronger sales and market value impacts and is expected to grow incrementally in seasonality drove an increase in service charges compared to the prior quarter looking ahead as announced yesterday we are making changes to our nsf and overdraft practices which along with previously implemented changes will further reduce these fees nsf and overdraft fees make up approximately of our service charge line item these changes will be implemented throughout but once fully rolled out together with our previous changes implemented last year we expect the annual impact to result in to lower service charges revenue versus based on our expectations around the implementation timeline we estimate million to million will be reflected in results regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 nsf and overdraft revenue has declined substantially over the last decade and once fully implemented we expect the annual contribution from these fees will be approximately lower than levels since nsf and overdraft revenue has decreased approximately million and debit interchange legislation reduced card and atm fees another million we have successfully offset these declines through expanded and diversified feebased services and as a result total noninterest income increased approximately million over this same time period through our ongoing investment in capabilities and services we will continue to grow and diversify revenue to overcome the impact of these new policy changes we expect adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to the prioryear driven primarily by growth in net interest income this growth includes the impact of lower ppprelated revenue and the anticipated impact of nsf and overdraft changes lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense has increased in the quarter salaries and benefits increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation base salaries also increased as we added approximately new associates primarily as a result of acquisitions that closed this quarter the increased head count also reflects key hires to support strategic initiatives within other revenueproducing businesses we have experienced some inflationary pressures already and expect certain of those to persist in if you exclude variablebased and incentive compensation associated with betterthanexpected fee income and credit performance as well as expenses related to our fourth quarter acquisitions our adjusted core expenses remained relatively stable compared to the prior year we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business as a result our core expense base will grow we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to importantly this includes the fullyear impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts despite these impacts we remain committed to generating positive adjusted operating leverage in overall credit performance remained strong annualized net chargeoffs increased basis points from the third quarters record low to basis points driven in part by the addition of enerbank in the fourth quarter fullyear net chargeoffs totaled basis points the lowest level on record since nonperforming loans continued to improve during the quarter and are now below prepandemic levels at just basis points of total loans our allowance for credit losses remained relatively stable at of total loans while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased percentage points to we expect credit losses to slowly begin to normalize in the back half of and currently expect fullyear net charge offs to be in the 25basispoint to 35basispoint range with respect to capital our common equity tier ratio decreased approximately basis points to an estimated this quarter during the fourth quarter we closed on three acquisitions which combined absorbed approximately billion of capital additionally we repurchased million of common stock during the quarter we expect to maintain our common equity tier ratio near the midpoint of our to operating range so wrapping up on the next slide are our expectations which weve already addressed in closing the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter positions us well for growth in as the economic recovery continues pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit risk is relatively regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 benign capital and liquidity are solid and were optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets with that were happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions operator instructions your first question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning so just going to i actually didnt expect to ask this question but the feedback that i got from investors in terms of the performance today obviously your outlook is quite upbeat is that the tangible book dilution from the deals that you announced rather closed in the fourth quarter surprised and david im wondering if you could share with us sort of the earnback period you expect for these deals on tangible book value david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well we look at several factors not just tangible book value we look at diversification of revenue we look at return on investment because when you the alternative is buying your stock back which also has a reduction in tangible book value so youre trying to look at the tradeoff between how you put your capital to work and frankly i cant even remember what the payback was if we were looking at a bank acquisition thats a little different where we would expect a payback period of three years or less but in this case were looking at diversification and being able to grow and the return on that investment is higher than the return we would have had if we wouldve bought our shares back operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 a couple questions first on the announcement that you made yesterday on the changes to the overdraft insufficient funds fees i know you sized it for could you give us a sense as to if that were to go in full year full on what that level would be because obviously as we think into we need to understand how youre thinking about an annualized impact would be looking like john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so the guidance we provided betsy is if you go back to take the total service charge revenue the impact is going to be somewhere between and of total service charge revenue based on revenue once all the changes are implemented and annualized david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and that includes all of the things we already have done too so its a cumulative number so if you go back to that you can calculate and round numbers will be half were going to have half to maybe slightly more than that done in and so it in double at for close proximity of what the total would be betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and when you say the service charges from youre talking about the service charges from in your income statement not what shows up as regulatory like overdraft john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thats correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc regulatory filing john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thats correct david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and we think about it that way regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the youre going back john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp because i mean ultimately all these fees are associated with the consumer business and as we think about how we overcome that loss of revenue it is through growth in consumer checking accounts additional activity debit card usage debit card fees other things that come with that and as david has pointed out earlier if you go back to timeframe and come forward weve been able to significantly grow noninterest revenue while overcoming the loss of revenue associated with reg e and other changes we expect the same will be true as we look forward relative to the changes were making here david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and betsy just to help you out a little if you go into our public filings and our supplement our service charge number was million its off that number betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right right okay i was just going to confirm that all right great thank you and then a followup question here just on how youre thinking about the sabal acquisition and how thats going to feed into not only the income statement i heard you talk about its in the capital markets revenue line but maybe help us understand is there any balance sheet impact here and the expectation that you have to grow this business from where it is today john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so i would say the balance sheet impact will be modest well have an opportunity to develop relationships that might lead to our providing credit to customers andor opening deposit relationships we expect that to be true for sure the primary benefit we derived from sabal is the capabilities we have permanent placement capabilities that we ultimately end up with i think were one of four or five banks in the country that will have a complete array of real estate permanent placement products whether it be a fannie license freddie licenses for large and small ph dow or cmbs capabilities we can bank our real estate customers needs across the spectrum and as weve transitioned from the great recession to today we built i think a really solid real estate business real estate permanent placement revenue in will exceed million thats from zero in effectively so weve been building that business around regional and national real estate developers really strong balance sheets good liquidity and access to capital the portfolio has performed very very well and we think this gives us an opportunity to extend those relationships and drive additional profitability betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and theres been some pretty recently some significant uptick in that demand for that product right regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yes and again i think if you just look at the multifamily market and its awfully good and now those developers who like to build and hold want access to both the fannie products and the freddie products from time to time and weve again found that to be a great source of revenue and a wonderful way to build stronger deeper relationships with that customer segment betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the loan growth front i want to see if you can maybe give us a little more color on the to growth expectation you have for the year and maybe if you can unpack it by giving us a little bit of color on the growth you expect for commercial and cre and consumer and how that could play out for the year thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john its david so first thing we have to overcome it depends on if youre looking at it on the average which is where are the to first thing you have to do is overcome ppp average which is about billion so put that in your model then if you look at areas where we can grow clearly were going to get benefit of enerbank having a whole year of enerbank along with its growth that we expect and so thats a big driver of our averaging mortgage ought to have a may not have as much production as we have in for but we still believe well grow the balance sheet quite nicely there we expect credit card to continue to grow and then on commercial even after you consider overcoming the ppp runoff on average at billion we think we can still grow that on top of it as we look at the industries that we were particularly strong in in in the commercial space financial services health care transportation our assetbased lending homebuilder and to a lesser degree technology those are areas that we did see growth in quite nice growth and expect to continue into and its been geographically diverse as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay all right thanks and then separately on the operating leverage expectation based upon your guidance youre looking for about basis points indiscernible operating leverage can you just talk to us about how if fed hikes may be proved to be less than expected is that basis points operating leverage still attainable do you still have levers to pull to be to basically generate that despite any move by the fed regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well it certainly makes it harder but as weve always said our goal is to generate positive operating leverage over time and if our revenue grows in there then we double down on expense management and we obviously didnt get there this year nor did anybody else that im aware of but we believe theres a reasonable path to that and thats why we gave you the guidance it showed you that roughly basis points or more and we have things we can do during the year that can help us get there but yeah rates not coming in at the pace we think or as many as we think will put pressure on that calculation but we wouldnt give up on it just because of that john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks for taking my question operator your next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning just following up on the commentary around the positive operating leverage i was hoping you could frame a little bit more the how much variability there is around that to increase that you have in your outlook for expenses as those rate hikes begin to flow through the forward curve reflects four hikes next year but some are expecting more than that so how does the number of hikes i guess to the extent that we get more influence the expense line and does that or outlook hold and on top of that it would be great if you could also discuss your confidence level and being able to control the expense base such that you continue you still achieve that positive operating leverage even under different inflation scenarios david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well you have a lot up there so let me see if i can help you out so on the expense side the to a large portion of that a substantial portion of that was related to the acquisitions that we had so we closed on three deals in the fourth quarter one of them right at the end of the year so well have a fullyear run rate on all of those coming through and thats the biggest single driver of the to if you go back and look at our compound annual growth rate on expense management weve actually done a pretty good job of controlling our expenses and we dont do that in just one area but at salaries and benefits and furniture fixtures and equipment and occupancy and vendor spend all of those things we are all over and john has this our continuous improvement program is still going where were looking to improve processes each and every day leveraging technology to help us control our expense load so i think in terms of the revenue side we have four baked into our guidance that we just gave you four basis points of moves each quarter so on average you get two during the year and it depends on will we get basis points or will be more than that well be more than four or less than four i mean you have to weve told you in our guidance that each basis points is million to million for us so you can put your model and kind of work with that but back to the question earlier i think from john pancari in terms of operating leverage we are committed to generating positive operating leverage over time and when things get more challenging well do what we can to manage expenses so ill leave it at that regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator your next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with the bank of america john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess one just question a followup on the overdraft its been a big overhang on the stock and i get your guidance around the impact this year david but just talk to us downside just the industry seems to be moving away from your give us a sense of like the use case of why theres a subset of overdraft fees that needs to exist and why you feel or care what competitively and from a regulatory standpoint that that component of fees will be dependable on david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well so as we put it in our guidance yesterday were eliminating nsf fees altogether ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp we still have overdraft fees for a service that were providing which is liquidity to our customer base and they appreciate the ability to be able to have that liquidity in time of need and theres a cost to that and now weve done some things weve given alerts weve changed our posting order were going to give small dollar loans were going to give you a paycheck up to two days available in some cases and so were doing a lot of things to make it easier for our customers to bank with us and to understand where they stand at any point in time but if they need that liquidity we want to be there weve limited our we will be limiting our overdraft to no more than three per day too which is one of the strongest in the industry so were doing a lot of things we think thats a value play for our customers so they want that ability for that shortterm liquidity at the cost that we charge for it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess just a separate question around loan growth apologies if i missed it but talk to us about the enerbank acquisition what that means for growth especially some of the nonfootprint i think half of enerbank is outside of the core region footprint give us a perspective in terms of the opportunity that you have there both in terms of what enerbank does today and how to scale that up david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we acquired about billion worth of loans right at the end of the at the beginning of the fourth quarter well get all that in our averaging numbers which is where our to growth is for next year their regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 production had been about of the industry which equated to about billion in terms of production and thats what they were doing and we think we have the ability to take that and ramp it up over time and have nice growth there were excited about enerbank and excited about the fact that our geographic expansion of that is outside of our core footprint it brings us the ability to have more customers throughout the country to do other banking services with as well including small business contractors that offer products to consumers so it is a big portion of our growth expectation and we couldnt be more excited about adding enerbank and the people that work there to the regions family ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys another just followup on the expenses david can you help us understand of the to growth what part of that is just organic growth what part is actually coming from the acquisitions getting into the run rate and then what are you doing in terms of like offsets in terms of continuous improvement type of efficiencies david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah ken as i mentioned earlier the overwhelming majority of our growth is related to the acquisitions that we have weve been able and will continue to control our core expenses by managing the things i talked about managing salaries and benefits and head count and our square footage whether it be branch or office square footage when you manage your head count you manage the number of computers you have to have its vendor spend its our procurement group really ensuring that from a demand management standpoint that people that are asking for vendors and thirdparty services really need them and when we have to have them making sure that we get the best price for the services that were getting thats ongoing thats part of our continuous improvement program and you couple that with leveraging technology and taking out processes that we have were not finished there now we have to create opportunities to reinvest so embedded in the to are the investments that were making in people and our certain markets that we have that we see opportunities for growth there we invest in technology the people and services to help us there so all thats embedded in the numbers that weve given you but cutting to the chase of the to the vast majority of that is related to the acquisitions that we announced ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 yeah understand and i apologize i missed that comment earlier im going to follow up separately david then on the just on that indiscernible you terminated a little bit more this quarter just want to understand like what percentage of that book is now kind of locked out from either you that youve terminated or you understand the maturity schedule and we see from your that color nii slide what that expected trajectory is like so i dont think theres much change but can you let us know if theres anything different in terms of how youre viewing that portfolio going forward thank you david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah ken so we continue to kind of read the tea leaves and where the fed is going and the market with regards to rates so we took some of our protection off it unwinds this summer so we have a little bit more asset sensitivity that comes in in the second half of the year but we have to continue to monitor that because its important its important for us to make sure that we have the proper sensitivity when we expect rates to go and we do and now its just timing a month ago maybe a rate increase or two other day its four this morning there are people talking about maybe it will only be a couple so i mean theres a this is very volatile and were trying to do the best we can to anticipate where those rate moves are going and weve locked in a good portion of our fair value if you will of our hedge portfolio over half so i think that were in good shape we can terminate some of those quickly if we want to put more sensitivity in but right now we think were in a pretty good spot ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and do you have an upper bounds of the sensitivity and how much you let it float off and thanks for the answers david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp what we really want to do is were not trying to top pick our margin in nii what were trying to do is have a repeatable predictable income statement what we do when rates get to a point where theres risk of it going down we do have risk parameters in terms of how much risk we can have on nii with a 100basispoint move but for us is really trying to anticipate where the market is going to move so we can take full advantage there but we dont want to have an unusual pickup in any given period whether be a quarter or a year thats not repeatable thats not helpful to score our shareholders over time so were trying to get back we had given you a range of getting up to our margin in the range with a normal interest rate environment were probably going to be in the higher on a core basis this quarter coming up so well have a little bit of growth there but its just making incremental moves on the portfolio as we see the interest rate environment change ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks again david operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi david can you elaborate further on slide where you give us the interest rate exposure and you talked about your deposit beta particularly in the first basis points of being due to the higher betas on your surge deposits can you tell us how large on the surge deposits on the audio gap and can you give us some color on how you define surge deposits david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so our total surge deposits just mathematically are about billion okay and so when you think of those surge deposits in terms of beta reaction theres really two things that are happening with those surge deposits of the surge deposits about of those we think would have actually a lower beta im sorry a higher beta thats billion and we would put that beta at all right i would think its going to be pretty high pretty reactive if you look at the other we think based on that nature of those accounts that those deposits went into that that beta is going to be similar to our legacy the beta which is then if you take the rest of our core legacy deposits we put a beta on that as well and if you go back and look at the last basispoint rate increase that we had the last cycle thats what the beta was so thats the math that weve really gotten to in our guidance that were giving you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and david on the surge deposit and the exit nonoperating deposits from your corporate customers or the consumers that makes less money leftover from the stimulus david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah a big portion of those surge deposits are corporate deposits that came in because thats the best place they could put their money and thats why we believe that of those deposits call it billion at of the billion its going to be very reactive because their corporate customers that are likely to put want to put those to work in a more meaningful place and we dont need to pay up for that so we expect those to probably either move out or to be more expensive gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you highlighted your net chargeoff ratio i think you said its the lowest that youve seen and about this fee indiscernible pointed to net chargeoffs initially probably staying around the low levels you saw in the fourth quarter gradually in the second half of the year start to head towards maybe normalization is that based on just because the rates were so low that its hard to maintain that or is it formulaic or some underwriting that you have done that says now were going to start slowly start to see higher net chargeoffs later in the year excluding of course the acquisitions that may have influenced the reported numbers regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah its not an underwriting change its a reality that obviously consumers and businesses were propped up by stimulus consumers in particular while that stimulus is running out in this quarter in terms of the child care tax credit weve been unusually low has it as has the in the industry so i think that our expectation is we would start to normalize because of the runoff of the stimulus which starts manifesting itself in the second half of the year but that being said we still think chargeoffs will be rather lower than history at basis points to basis points for we have if the economy continues to perform and consumers do well and manage your money well maybe our chargeoffs at the lower end of that range so a bit of it is trying to anticipate when normalization will occur gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with the deutsche bank john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning it might be a little bit too early to think about this but given rate expectations have increased so much when does that start factoring into how youre underwriting because obviously if rates go up to or even more it does put pressure on borrowers david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think matt one of the things so were talking about four basis points moves to get off of virtually zero if you think of a consumer a lot of the consumer portfolios are fixed rate portfolios so they dont end up having much of an interest rate shock in four moves on the corporate banking side again four moves on them weve been monitoring our customers we know which where they stand a lot of them hedge we would expect that as rates starting start to move we actually put on our customers would put on more hedge protection if you will so we again we dont see a lot of payment shocks there i think its the risk is running out of stimulus and also is there something unique in a given business or industry that could drive losses higher versus rates at this point john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp but the only other thing id say is on a normal course of business and when underwriting credits were always stressing for interest rate sensitivity and among other things that might occur so that would not be a change in our common current practice regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately and apologies if i missed it your capital markets revenue has been strong all year and you did increase kind of the run rate for but weve seen some of your peers have really strong cap markets fees in and i think part of it might just be a mix issue but maybe you could talk to that if you didnt earlier and if you did ill look at the transcript thank you john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp no no no i think its a good question if you just look at the bulk of our capital markets revenue distributed across both capital raising and advisory services so whether its real estate permanent placement ma loan syndications or fixed income transactions we are generating relatively similar amounts of revenue across those platforms so we got good diversity now weve added clearsight advisors and weve added sabal capital and so when you consider the contribution that those acquisitions will make in concert with the businesses that or products capabilities that weve developed we think the run rate of million to million per quarter is appropriate matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah good morning thanks so just one clarifying question first i wanted to make sure david from your earlier commentary that the loan growth the to does include the runoff of ppp or is it ex that ppp impact david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no it includes that its that was one of the important points that it includes overcoming that and having to growth on the average that you see for the year and its in our supplement john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp perfect thats what i thought i heard thank you thats great and then maybe the one other question i had is can you talk a little bit about the handoff kind of from the hedging income to the greater rate sensitivity that obviously now youre pulling forward a bit i know you have some detail there on slide but im just kind of wondering if you can walk through that is there the possibility that on a quartertoquarter basis we could see some decline is that million run rate kind of pulls down and the impact of higher rates pulls it back up regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i mean you can always have a little timing issue from a quartertoquarter but weve got a number of things going on in that chart that you can see in particular our growth loan growth in our enerbank transaction that we had but a good portion of our hedge portfolio is locked in and were adding the sensitivity of i forgot who asked the question earlier but we had a little bit of sensitivity that help us in the second half of the year the key thing on the early moves too is that were still very asset sensitive because of our deposit base and so when you start seeing the first couple of moves that bait is pretty close to zero and so i think that will aid in the handoff but it might not be perfect but if youre looking at making an investment in us over a period of time weve got to we think were well positioned to grow as the economy continues to grow we get higher rates and thats where regions really shines because our deposit base that low core lowcost core deposit base of ours is better differentiator for us as you havent seen we havent been able to extract the value out of it because weve been in such a lowrate environment but now were starting to see that opportunity if in fact we get the rate increases that the forms have baked in stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay thats very helpful and just the one other point on that chart is the impact of organic growth obviously is increasing in each subsequent year in and is that to convey that you think organic growth can be even better from a loan growth perspective or just that it will be more meaningful given it will be at higher rate david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well its a little bit of both i think we can continue to see absolute balance growth weve acquired new portfolios and as i mentioned so just one example is enerbank where we added billion the production there historically had been about billion were in a lot of states and we have a distribution thats far better in our bank than what they would have had and they were a regulated energy company right so we have the ability to take that to a new level and so thats just one example thats why we continue to make investments because we see opportunities to take a portfolio and be able to push that through our network and all the people that we are working for us to continue to grow youre also getting help by the rate environment so thats baked into that to compound annual growth rate as well stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect thats encouraging thanks for the color david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah operator your next question is from the line of christopher spahr with wells fargo john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning so my question is about expenses last month you said was kind of a core run rate for at least to think about wage increases is that kind of a good starting point to think about expenses for next year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp actually chris weve had weve seen some inflation this year that number is going to be a little bit higher as we think about merit increases payments we need to make to retain certain folks in particular people that are in the technology side of the house recruiting those type things so that is a little bit higher than that now that is baked into the guidance we gave you and so i guess bottom line is we have experienced inflation and we expect that to persist into john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp no chris question was around if i heard you correctly chris christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats correct john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and that inflation thats not transient thats a going to be in the run rate for and then youre going to continue now will you be able to revert back to merit increases that are more consistent in like we had in the past and i think thats accurate john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i guess im going to turn audio gap christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc so the difference between dealrelated cost that youve seen this year versus what is going to be more about run rate inflation or wage pressure david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well the main thing is the to that were going to experience the vast majority of that is related to the acquisitions that we had christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 okay and then one quick followup please so last month you said i think was a good starting point to put money to work i think given kind of a high level of dry powder even with the surge deposits is that still your thought process or do you think its going to be a higher level now given with the years already john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah no we still think so we think the short end as we told you we probably have four shortterm rate increases going in this year but we still think the 10year kind of hangs out and approaches by the end of the year so we dont move as much we do think theres opportunities theres a lot of volatility there if we see the ability to put billion or more to work in the securities book and were convicted on that wed be happy to we have more cash idle cash than most everybody because we just have been reluctant to want to take the duration risk because we just dont think were appropriately compensated for it that being said things can change and if we see closer to that on the that may persuade us to put a little bit more to work now remember were getting paid for all the increases on the short run short rate for the money at the fed so were getting paid a little bit more there christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi david hi john so just a clarification on a couple of the last two questions so you said if the year gets closer to you might put some to work with you is anything factored into your nii guidance for reinvestment of some of that liquidity or not john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp no we do not that would be on top of what were giving you vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the expense question that i just asked so are you assuming the incentive comp increase that you had in is that stays at that level in your guidance john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 no its not forecasted to stay at that level that was vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp the incentive comp was up i think across industry and we dont forecast that it would remain at that level at this time vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then partly because youre assuming some of those revenues will not continue like mortgage and capital markets david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well no weve given you in our revenue growth but thats all baked into the budget and so you dont get compensated at that level over par if you hit your budget youve got to have a much better year than that which is what we and most of the industry players did this year but you reset your expectations now youre back down at par you got to start it all over again john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp that makes sense yeah were increasing targets so that will have a the impact of reducing incentives vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right right okay makes sense and the last one for both of you loan growth youve talked about very strong pipelines which implies that youre expecting loan growth to remain good are you seeing implies that we are expecting loan growth to remain good are you seeing that how are you seeing january how are you seeing january has that continued to be strong because we obviously saw a bigger pickup later in fourth quarter and in fact continuing in this first couple of three weeks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah our pipeline is still good customers are optimistic they are i think hopeful that well see trends continue theyre prepared to make investments investments are still constrained in some measure by some uncertainty and by shortage of labor in a lot of cases but we do have there are a lot of customers who are actually looking at investments and want to expand their balance sheets invest in businesses and the same is true of consumers who are spending and so we do expect just to continue to see loan growth vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator your final question is from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning could you just talk about your interest now in more nonbank acquisitions and where if thats still the case where your interest lies where the strongest interest lies in terms of revenue diversification john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so we do continue to have an interest in nonbank acquisitions we like to think continue to add to some of the consumer lending capabilities we have acquired if those opportunities arise invest in capital markets i think that got a nice return on those investments and been able to leverage those new capabilities to expand relationships were interested in opportunities within wealth management im always looking to acquire mortgage servicing rights if those are available and to potentially add to our mortgage business so those would be a couple of areas where we would make investment jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc perfect great thanks so much operator thank you i will turn the call back over to john turner for closing remarks john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay well thank you were also proud of and all that our associates have accomplished during some very challenging times staying focused on our customers on each other investing
