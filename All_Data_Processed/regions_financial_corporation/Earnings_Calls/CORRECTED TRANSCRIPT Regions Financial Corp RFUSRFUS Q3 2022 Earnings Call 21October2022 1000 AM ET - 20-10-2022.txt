we once again generated record adjusted pretax pre provision income this quarters results reflect strong revenue growth driven by higher rates robust loan growth low deposit cost and wellcontrolled operating expenses asset quality remains broadly stable with credit metrics in line to slightly better than prepandemic levels in general we feel good about the health of both our corporate and consumer customers many of our business customers have adopted operating models capable of thriving in uncertain operating environments and remain cautiously optimistic about opportunities to grow and

consumers remains generally positive we will continue to monitor our portfolios for indicators of stress we have robust credit and interest rate risk management frameworks and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk which has positioned us well to continue to deliver consistent sustainable longterm performance now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans grew while ending loans grew during the quarter ending loans reflect the impact of the strategic sale of billion of consumer loans on the last day of the quarter it represents another example of our disciplined approach to capital allocation average business loans increased reflecting highquality broadbased growth across all businesses and industries specifically financial services wholesale durables transportation information services and multifamily approximately of the growth again this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses commercial line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately modestly lower versus the prior quarter however loan production remained strong with linkedquarter commitments of billion unfavorable capital market pricing continues to augment loan growth however we believe improved market conditions will eventually lead to clients refinancing off our balance sheet through the debt markets average consumer loans grew while ending loans declined driven primarily by the previously mentioned loan sale growth in average mortgage credit card and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories within other consumer interbank loans which are primarily prime and super prime grew compared to the prior quarter we expect full year average loan growth of approximately this assumes a slowing rate of growth compared to the third quarter lets turn to deposits as expected deposits continued to normalize in the quarter average total consumer balances were modestly lower quarteroverquarter largely consistent with typical prepandemic seasonal effects despite inflationary pressures consumer balances have remained relatively stable supported by wage increases and prudent spending additionally new customers and additional account acquisition remains healthy normalization has been more evident in average corporate and commercial deposits which are down billion quarteroverquarter however overall liquidity managed by the corporate bank on and offbalancesheet is relatively stable compared to yearend levels reflecting the movement of some customer funds to offbalance sheet treasury management options the movement to these products and the remixing out of noninterest bearing checking accounts into higheryielding money market and savings accounts is as expected and is reflected in our overall deposit beta assumptions for this cycle ending balances have declined approximately billion yeartodate in line with our full year expectation for overall deposit reduction of between billion and billion a rapidly rising rate environment is a significant regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 competitive advantage for regions based on the combination of our legacy deposit base and the more resilient components of surge deposits lets shift to net interest income and margin reflecting our assetsensitive profile net interest income grew million or quarteroverquarter while reported net interest margin increased basis points to our adjusted margin was reflecting the combined effects of average cash balances of billion and ppp the cycle todate deposit beta remains low at contributing to higherthananticipated net interest income growth we expect full year deposit betas in the highteens in addition to higher rates growth in average loan balances provided further support for net interest income looking forward while we do expect cash balances to continue to normalize we do not anticipate accessing more expensive wholesale borrowing markets for multiple quarters this coupled with additional hedge maturities in the fourth quarter provides further runway for margin expansion total net interest income is projected to increase to in the fourth quarter and is now expected to be approximately to higher than the first quarter of reported net interest margin is projected to surpass in the fourth quarter while we have purposely retained leverage to higher interest rates during a period of low rates our attention has shifted to normalizing our interest rate risk profile in todays uncertain environment through the first half of we added billion of swaps and securities the swaps became effective in the latter half of and and generally have a term of three years this represents approximately of the total hedging amount expected this cycle as previously disclosed hedging already completed will support a margin floor even if rates move back to below we made some modest tactical changes to our profile in the third quarter primarily extending some of our current protection we still expect to execute an additional billion of hedges and well balance market rate levels and risk to growth as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program now lets take a look fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income declined from the prior quarter as a modest increase in wealth management was offset by declines in other categories service charges declined as the impact of policy enhancements implemented in midjune offset increases and other service charges including treasury management we expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in overdraft policy changes made todate are expected to result in full year service charges of approximately million in in after including the impact of a grace period feature full year service charges are expected to be approximately million within capital markets activity was negatively impacted by the delay of ma deals and higher rates in real estate capital markets results also include a positive million cva and dva adjustment we expect capital markets to generate fourth quarter revenue in the million to million range excluding the impact of cva and dva card and atm fees declined quarteroverquarter credit card income was negatively impacted by higher costs associated with a reward liability while checkcard and atm fees produced lower interchange due to a decline in both transaction volume and discretionary spending resulting from higher inflation elevated interest rates and seasonally lower production drove mortgage income lower during the quarter but was partially offset by higher servicing income regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 wealth management continues to perform well despite ongoing market volatility and we expect this business to grow incrementally yearoveryear we also expect full year adjusted total revenue to be up to driven primarily by growth in net interest income partially offset by lower ppprelated revenue and the impact of overdraft policy changes so lets move on to noninterest expense reported professional and legal expenses reflect a charge related to the resolution of a previously announced regulatory matter we do anticipate million of this charge will be mitigated by insurance reimbursement proceeds which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter excluding this and other adjusted items adjusted noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior quarter salaries and benefits increased primarily due to an increase of fulltime equivalent associates as well as one additional day in the quarter this increase was partially offset by lower variablebased compensation and a decrease in payroll taxes over of the increase in associate head count are customerfacing within our three lines of business we expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to importantly this includes the full year impact of the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of last year as well as inflationary impacts with the changes in revenue and expense guidance we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately in although the consumer loan sale and hurricanespecific reserve create some volatility in certain credit metrics this quarter underlying credit performance remained broadly stable reported annualized net chargeoffs increased basis points however excluding the impact of the consumer loan sale adjusted net chargeoffs were in line with our expectations at basis points a 2basispoint increase over the prior quarter we are seeing some deterioration in certain commercial segments that contributed to a quarteroverquarter increase in nonperforming loans but it is important to note that we remain below prepandemic levels provision expense was million this quarter the increase relative to the second quarter was due primarily to another quarter of strong growth in loans and commitments normalizing credit from historically low levels and a million reserve build for potential losses associated with hurricane ian these increases were partially offset by a net provision benefit of million associated with a consumer loan sale our allowance for credit loss ratio is up basis point to of total loans while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remain strong at our yeartodate adjusted net chargeoff ratio is basis points and we now expect our full year adjusted net chargeoff ratio to remain approximately basis points we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio in an estimated reflecting solid capital generation through earnings partially offset by continued strong loan growth given the uncertain economic outlook we plan to manage capital levels to the mid to upperend of our to operating range over time so in closing weve delivered strong yeartodate performance despite volatile economic conditions we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers and also remain vigilant with respect to any indicators of potential market contraction pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit remains broadly stable and capital and liquidity are solid with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning good morning john i guess maybe just to start out i mean obviously revenue backdrop and nii looking pretty good heading into next year just give us a sense of how youre thinking about using some of these towards franchise investments how we should think about expense growth going from here both in terms of investments youre making inflationary cost that youre seeing and just using a better revenue backdrop to actually invest in the franchise thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah ebrahim this is david so as you saw we made some quite a bit of investment last year in the fourth quarter through three nonbank acquisitions we continue to look for opportunities in all three lines of business to continue to grow our franchise we have a lot of things going on we have our new systems were going to be putting in over time and well see cost increases related to that but we have our continuous improvement program that we continue to leverage to keep our total expense growth under control were not going to give you guidance for next year but we do have a page in the deck that shows you what our compound annual growth rate has been very strong in managing keeping and our cost down and were going to continue to do that while making appropriate investments we dont have anything specific were going to look for opportunities to help grow our three lines of businesses ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and those deals are essentially tuckin deals be it fintech or fee kind of deals that youve done recently similar to those david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats correct ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick question i mean obviously your hedging strategy is wellunderstood as we think about in a world where rates overshoot expectations relative to the forward curve is there any risk to a potential regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 jack to the margin at least in the shortterm where feds not cutting but we actually see that its going much higher than what the forward curves pricing in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think you have a couple different things higher rates for our type of franchise is good for us so to the extent we overshoot on fed funds well benefit from that clearly if it stays up there longer you end up having some incremental credit risk because if rates are that high that means inflation continues to be higher than the fed wants and they have to keep going so there could be some incremental credit risk until you get to settle down from a rate increase standpoint the reason we havent completed our hedging program and the reason we have billion of cash is partially wanting to and i want to use hedge again but part of trying to figure out where rates might go so we have a bit of dry powder thats about billion that we have dry not counting the million on the books to hedge and were looking for a better foothold so we could be patient our nii is growing nicely without that and i think in our material we show you that we can protect a margin right now of if rates were to go back to or below so being patient i think is the right thing for us to be ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning good morning just on the credit front if you could give us a bit more detail on the unsecured consumer loan sale in terms of the actual types of credits that were sold and any remaining sales expected on that front and if so how are you thinking about the lost content on any remaining transactions on that side david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure john its david so we acquired enerbank in the fourth quarter last year its an unsecured consumer portfolio we told you at that time we could grow that portfolio double digits that industry was about billion industry so youre talking about ph billion worth of production each year but we also had this other unsecured consumer portfolio that we had built up over time that those loans were not being serviced by us or serviced by a thirdparty and we thought that the right thing to do from a capital allocation regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 standpoint a risk reduction standpoint would be to sell that portfolio as we continue to invest in growing our enerbank book as you can see in the slides we had reserved about million we ended up taking chargeoffs of million so we had million worth of provision benefit thats flowing through the financials this quarter but it was really a capital allocation and a risk reduction measure and we dont anticipate at this time having anything else we dont have any other unsecured portfolios like that thats not true we do have a small one thats in runoff john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay all right thats helpful and then separately also on credit sorry can you give us a little detail around the increase in npls i know you mentioned some commercial segments so what commercial areas did you see that increase anything indicative of a trend you see there and then i know you mentioned that youre seeing some normalization in credit that influenced your provisioning in what areas are you seeing that normalization and could that interpret into higher chargeoff expectations for even though i know youre at bps for thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah john this is john so we are seeing some stress in the office portfolio particularly urban office a reflection of some of the backtowork changes that were all seeing in the economy consumer discretionaryrelated kinds of businesses where consumers are choosing not to spend as freely as they had been some softness in notfor profit healthcare related to rising labor cost and inflation similarly in senior housing again were seeing i would say some impacts from both labor and inflationary cost and then some disruption in technologyrelated businesses all that id characterize as beginnings of what we would call normalization were at historically low levels in terms of credit quality the best ive seen in my almost 40year career and so we do expect credit metrics to begin to normalize in and beyond currently at basis points of npls still much better than prepandemic levels chargeoffs as you noted basis points for the quarter we expect basis points for the year well firm up our guidance for in late december or january but our current projection is that chargeoffs in will be somewhere between and basis points as we begin to see a return to more normal levels again of credit quality john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right thanks for taking my questions very helpful john john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning everyone if i could just focus in on the fee side i see youre continuing to your reiterate your service fees guidance of million indiscernible through the recent settlement and the incremental changes that youre making and the confidence you have in continuing to reiterate that level of service fees for next year thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah ken thank you for the question i think what were observing is customer patterns are very much what we expected when we made changes so you might recall that we changed our posting order we provided customers with alerts we reduced the cap on daily overdraft fees we eliminated charging for nsf we eliminated charges for overdraft protection transfers most recently were giving customers access to their paycheck two days in advance we also have implemented an overdraft protection line of credit to help customers and in probably the second half of well also implement a grace period all that designed to help customers better manage their finances and were seeing a positive impact its not necessarily a trend but i would say over the last quarter weve seen about a reduction in the number of customers who are overdrawing their account which is again i think a very positive thing we talked about historically how weve dealt with changes in fees and id point to overdraft fees as an example since weve seen almost a reduction in the collection of overdraft fees and yet we overcame that and grew noninterest revenue over that same period of time by almost million so we have a history of continuing to evolve and change our business to overcome losses in fee revenues were doing that through growth in capital markets growth in treasury management growth in wealth management and other parts of our business and so we feel good about the impact to customers and believe that we can manage the impact to our business ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and a second followup just in terms of wealth management really has bucked the market trend here continuing to increase in a really tough market can you just talk about is that new customer wins and business adds and is that more than overcoming just the natural market challenges john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah its a combination of a number of things one we have very strong retail investment services business works very closely with our branch bankers and in this environment see a lot of customers who are interested in acquiring annuities so weve seen nice growth in that source of fee revenue regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 our institutional business is growing and weve had some nice wins there and then within wealth management both opportunities to move new business new customers and weve additionally seen about of our increase in fee revenue in the personal wealth management business is a result of customers moving money to us during this period of time where theyre looking for more stability our approach to the business is as a fiduciary and i think during uncertain and volatile times customers are choosing to increase their level of business with us so all those things are contributing to growth in wealth fee income ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning good morning my first question is for david david youre implying an exit rate for nii of billion in the midpoint of the range of your guide and im wondering as we think about that as a jumping off point do you think that you can continue to grow that level of nii based on the forward curve in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think we have as i mentioned earlier we have some dry powder left we still have billion of cash we dont have to access the wholesale market for several quarters based on our estimates we have still a little bit of hedging to do we did some slight repositioning this past quarter to help continue to grow nii and our resulting margin and really taking advantage of what could be a much higher rate environment i would tell you our guidance is baked on a 75basispoint increase in november followed by basis points and then basis points if we had to do it all over again we probably have that a little bit higher so i think we have some incremental opportunities to grow and our loan growth has been nice we have a very solid balance sheet we leverage our deposit franchise and i think you can i think were hitting a pretty good tailwind here hopefully wrapping up the year strongly and really positioning to be a pretty spectacular year as well again well give you a better guidance when we get to the earnings call in january erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then as a followup as we think about deposit trends clearly the rate curve implies a terminal rate over basis points greater than since we last spoke in this type of earnings context im wondering if you could give us a sense of how do you youve been very active with regards to managing some of the surge deposits regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 how do you think about deposit growth from fourth quarter do you think most of the surge deposits and that impact would have been driven out of the bank and additionally with a cumulative beta in the third quarter how should we think about terminal beta within the new fed funds rate indiscernible the forward curve is implying david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so weve been saying all along that we expected deposits to decline in the corporate space in particular those surge deposits of billion to billion were down about billion since last yearend and i think that we still expect that to happen were holding on to more than we thought and so perhaps thats a positive to us i think as you think about betas so our beta last cycle was about right weve been guiding that its going to be higher this go around to the mid to upper our cumulative beta now is at i think linked quarter were at this next quarter youre going to see that move up a bit we expect about a beta in the fourth quarter it will take our cumulative to the midteens and then in the first quarter were probably going to see even higher beta than that call it which will get our cumulative to about at that time so i think youre going to just continue to see this eek up a bit but we believe our beta as like the last time will be lower than our peers which is the value of our franchise but call it mid to upper erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david hi guys david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can we follow up on the credit side of it again i know your levels of credit delinquencies and chargeoffs are extremely low but john when you were talking about some of the commercial stuff can you share with us just how large the syndicated loan portfolio is today as well as the leveraged portfolio and are there any signs that a syndicated portfolio is showing signs of more weakness than your just infootprint portfolio regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp sure gerard first of all no would be the answer to the last question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and the syndicated portfolio represents about of our overall portfolio interestingly weve had a increase in investmentgrade balances over the last months and so the investmentgrade portion of our overall portfolio is about today over the last three years or so weve seen the probability of default come down by basis points in other words the quality of our book continues to improve we believe our leverage book as defined by ph 3x4 is roughly billion dollars in total and about of that is in shared national credit exposure so again pretty high quality we think and were not seeing any deterioration to speak of in that portfolio at all david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp gerard this is david we have indiscernible dont get to the back of our deck but on page we have a lot of what john was just speaking to and it really shows the quite a bit of improvement in terms of probability of default and the investmentgrade improvement gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you and then following up on deposits obviously as you pointed out david a few times on the call the strength of the franchise is the deposits which is true for most banks prior to quantitative easing of course but whats striking is your slide that those median customer deposit balances just remain so healthy have you guys dug into it i think you may have referenced about maybe some higher paychecks on the consumer side thats keeping balances up but what are you guys sensing from why these balances just dont seem to be really falling off just yet david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the consumer has been very resilient in particular this bucket that we have on that page that group happened to be that cohort happened to be the recipient of a lot of stimulus they also are a recipient of minimum wage increases our unemployment rates below so these are people working and theyre being prudent where theyre spending and so they just have not spent more than they make and i think its attributable to what john just mentioned in terms of overdraft being down too i think they were being more cautious and careful in this period of time and with inflation you would expect this group to be hit more adversely but they also disproportionately benefited regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 so thats why youre seeing this on the surface it didnt make sense to you but thats what the data is telling us and weve gotten pretty granular with this group account by account by account which is where we got the information from gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and david this group youre referring to is this would you say a fico score group of high to low or is that about right david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp its not just lower income lower ficos it has to do with how people manage their money so its lower balances so this customer segment was under that can be people that have fine ficos they just spend about what they make so they dont have a lot in their account so its not necessarily the lower ficos band gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp uhhuh operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning everyone david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc following up on your comment on slide does the data tell you that the fed is going to have to do more or does your interpretation of this suggest rather that consumers and businesses are just in a better position to weather the downturn curious to hear sort of just your interpretation of slide david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp the fed doing more in terms of raising rates and slowing inflation or stimulus or what regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp from what context are you talking bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah yes the fed doing more in the sense that its the high level of liquidity and capacity to spend that is in and of itself fueling inflation and perhaps that that could lead the fed to do more from that perspective david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well we certainly think the fed is getting after inflation and as a result we think their move is going to be pretty strong this next couple of moves at least but this customer segment is just theyre just better so as our business is frankly better prepared for whatever downturn or slowdown we might have our base case is not a recession but we do think the probability of that has increased and if the fed moves at the pace we think theres a strong likelihood that that can happen but we think itll be fairly mild but we do think that customer spend patterns are down we saw that in our debit card transactions this quarter quarteroverquarter they were down and so we think people are already being prudent with that the inflation that were seeing is coming from labor in a very tight labor market its hard to get on top of that unless unemployment rate goes up some so i think thats what will happen over time and then other inflation is being driven by commodities which is really a supply imbalance right now versus demand but with the fed moving at the pace that theyre moving is going to slow that down its going to bring demand back to supply and i think youll see the expectation is you would see a slowdown from that standpoint bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful and the expectation of a mild recession to the extent that we have one that is consistent youre your reasonable and supportable outlook on slide but just for sensitivity purposes could you give a sense of what kind of impact taking the unemployment say to the level would have under reserve for example david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i can give you some data points but its important to know that when you start picking on one particular item there are a host of things that go into the calculation so what youre asking for is everything else being stable except for unemployment going to or so if you were to do and no other changes no response from the bank no anything you would probably have a reserve thats higher under a unemployment but again you start taking into account what is the unemployment mean where are interest rates and so our nii is likely overwhelming whatever credit issues that we might bake in so its a nice thing to think through but regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 there are just too many parts to kind of figure out what the netnet is we think higher rates for regions is still a net positive bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and if i can just for clarification ask a final question on slide sorry i just i forget what slide it was but your overall commentary about protecting nim in that range i think it was slide david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc in and beyond how far beyond does the protection extend and would that protection still hold in an extreme where rates fall to take into an extreme where if zirp were to return is the protection still in place or is it only up to a certain level of fed funds david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well generally when we put in hedges theyre about three years in duration so if you were talking about middle of and start so youre three years out from that so youre a protection and so we will look to extend those we still have room for more hedging and its dynamic we study this every single quarter and weve got a group that does it every day and so this is just a static position that were showing you as of the date we produced it bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay operator our next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler please proceed with your question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i guess i wanted to ask david maybe to you first what is it that makes you think these deposit betas will be higher this time around based on what youve seen so far is it really just a blending in of those surge deposits is it any sort of change in customer behavior i just would think with all your liquidity they would actually be a little bit lower based on what weve seen so far david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think one were coming from zero and we did have a lot of surge deposits billion worth of surge deposits we think that thats going to a third of thats going to move out we expected billion to billion hadnt happened yet if weve missed it weve been probably a little bit more conservative wed much rather give you a mid than a where we ended the last cycle but i think expectations would be for everybody it should be a bit higher were coming from a low and going to higher rate environment that we saw last time as well and so we kind of peaked last time pretty quickly and then start to come back down in i think it was so again if we miss it its probably because were a little conservative stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then just you referenced the level of liquidity cash balances here a number of times that you still have securities have been down the last couple of quarters obviously we saw some of those surge deposits out and you referenced no more borrowing so all those puts and takes there i guess how low could you see cash balances go and do you think youll have to continue to take securities lower to offset more of these potential outflows without borrowing david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah we generally would run with billion to billion of cash we got indiscernible to really take care of those surge deposits that we expect to run out and weve been a little bit opportunistic with not deploying our cash and securities because we didnt need to because we had good loan growth and we had good hedging and protection and so our nii was growing nicely there was no reason for us to we could have generated more nii but at the risk of missing an opportunity to invest that cash in a much better environment which is what were getting so i think being patient here is important and we really want to use that cash to fund our loan growth more importantly thats our first order of business versus trying to put it in the securities book at this point if we see where we think rates may cap out could we use our securities book for some incremental hedging yeah we can do that but think about it as we still have a lot of access to borrow from fhlb and our total liability cost right now basis points is the lowest in the peer group and we dont see where we need to access wholesale any time soon regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay thats great thanks for the time and congrats on the nii story playing out david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial

counties that got kind of hit historically youve seen some deposit inflows from aid and things like that is there any sort of expectation that you have for potential deposit inflows and is it material david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp michael at this point we dont theres still a lot of uncertainty ian hit right here at the quarterend we did our best estimate trying to figure out what the damage was going to be but youre rightly to point out that oftentimes in these storms theres a lot of money that comes into federal dollars state dollars and insurance money but we havent really contemplated any of that and our deposit guidance does not reflect any additional deposits coming from those sources michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2022 okay helpful and then maybe sorry if i missed this but so the range for capital markets was moved a little bit down as we think about going into next year where obviously the backdrop is softening to some degree is that kind of the new range that we should kind of expect in the kind of a near to intermediateterm for that business david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i wouldnt sign off on that just yet for next year well give you better range when we get to the january earnings that was really just more for this next quarter because of what we are seeing right now in particular with ma and real estate capital markets so dont lock that in for michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i understand youre not going to give any sort of guidance that i totally get what would be kind of the broader puts and takes in your eyes to be within the kind of the prior range or above it or below it et cetera david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i think if we can get ma back on track to where it was if you can get real estate capital markets to open up a bit just get more activity the whole capital markets are kind of down right this minute were going to continue to add some bolton acquisitions or at least looking for opportunities we had a couple that we added this past year and so were going to do some things to see if we cant help augment the pressure that were feeling from the lack of having again ma and real estate capital markets john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp just to be
