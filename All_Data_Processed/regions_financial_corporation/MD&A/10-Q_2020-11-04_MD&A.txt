item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is part of regions financial corporations regions or the company quarterly report on s health pandemics government stimulus and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts since the adoption of cecl on january regions has increased the allowance by billion from billion to billion which represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in table below while many of these items overlap regarding impact they are included in the category most

not have an associated allowance this balance includes million related to the initial allowance for nonpcd loans acquired as part of the ascentium acquisition impact included only for the quarter of acquisition while the third quarter of showed signs of economic improvement there continues to be uncertainty surrounding the economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic credit metrics improved during the third quarter and deferrals and forbearance balances declined additionally unprecedented stimulus is working its way through the economic system evidenced by higher consumer spend in the current quarter while economic growth improved the public health crisis is not resolved and continued economic uncertainty remains while the initial economic stimulus for those on unemployment expired in the third quarter a temporary stimulus was approved at a slightly reduced rate and many on unemployment had higher cash flows than when they were employed additionally mortgage ltvs are holding up well and the hpi showed robust appreciation as the credit risk within regions loan portfolio continues to be evaluated for the remainder of both negative and positive factors of the everevolving economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance estimate credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand external macroviews of credit metrics trends and industry outlooks as well as regions internal specific views of credit metrics and trends the third quarter of exhibited some signs of improvement from the initial onset of the covid19 pandemic as commercial and investor real estate criticized balances decrease d approximately million and total net chargeoffs decreased million compared to the second quarter conversely classified balances increased million and nonperforming loans excluding held for sale increase d million compared to the second quarter regions performed a bottomup review of commercial and ire loan portfolios during the third quarter which resulted in fewer sectors considered highrisk compared to the second quarter as of september billion of commercial and investor real estate loans are in covid19 highrisk industry segments a decline of billion from june these highrisk industries include energy healthcare other consumer services restaurants travel and leisure unsecured and investor real estate hotels unsecured retail and investor real estate retail refer to the portfolio characteristics section for more information about the highrisk industries regions purchased ascentium an independent equipment financing company on april the purchase included approximately billion in loans and leases to small businesses of which approximately were considered to be pcd regions considered loan payment status covid19 deferral status and loans in highrisk industries in covid19 highlyimpacted states in its determination of pcd the ascentium acquisition resulted in million in additional allowance in the second quarter of which million was recorded through the provision for credit losses and the remaining million was for acquired pcd loans and did not impact the provision for credit losses see the ascentium acquisition section for more information changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the allowance estimate under cecl regions economic forecast utilized in the january allowance estimate upon adoption of cecl considered a relatively benign economic environment the forecast utilized in the march allowance estimate considered a more stressed economic environment due to the onset of the covid19 pandemic based on early stage pandemic information the economic forecast utilized in the june allowance estimate included further deterioration primarily due to higher levels of unemployment the economic forecast utilized in the september allowance estimate includes normalization of economic activity albeit at an uneven pace across individual states and industry groups refer to the economic environment in regions banking markets within the third quarter overview section for more information regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available risks to the economic forecast included a high degree of uncertainty around how wide the covid19 pandemic could spread how long it could persist and if any public health changes could trigger another round of shutdowns in the second quarter of the economic environment produced unintuitive modeled results due to sensitivity to the unemployment forecasts specifically the transient spike in unemployment rates the cecl models are not built or conditioned to reflect the unprecedented levels of stimulus and cannot anticipate or connect the new relationships between economic variables and portfolio risks that existed during the second quarter in the third quarter of unemployment declined from the second quarter to more normalized yet elevated forecasted levels and the cecl models reacted as directionally expected the normalized yet elevated trends in the third quarter were considered to inform appropriate model adjustments for economic uncertainty industrylevel stress analyses were also performed on industries most acutely impacted by the covid19 pandemic refer to the portfolio characteristics section for more information about covid19 impacted industries while regions quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate the september general imprecision allowance considered the incremental risk specific to the economic uncertainty caused by covid19 on commercial and consumer models as well as the incremental risk associated with payment deferrals for certain consumer models that are not economically conditioned and as such do not fully consider these impacts the table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base forecast over the twoyear rs forecast period as of september the unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the cecl models unemployment normalized in the third quarter as noted above and after reviewing updated factors the company determined that a current period adjustment to the base forecast for unemployment was not required table macroeconomic factors in the forecast prers period

performed management deemed an allowance of billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of september in june the federal reserve disclosed their estimated modeled credit losses for regions as a part of the supervisory stress test the federal reserves economic scenario resulted in estimated losses for regions of billion whereas this scenario assumed a different macroeconomic outlook than regions it may represent a possible range of potential credit losses assuming a longerterm widespread pandemic as a point of clarification the federal reserves scenario assumes severe deterioration across both business services commercial and investor real estate and consumer portfolios while regions assumes deterioration mainly in the business services portfolio additionally the federal reserves estimate includes no benefit of government stimulus or benefit from debt payment relief being offered by regions and other financial institutions see the third quarter overview section for further information regarding the companys economic outlook changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods in addition bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected additionally changes in circumstances related to individually large credits commodity prices or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility the scenarios discussed above or other scenarios have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ perhaps materially from the originally estimated amounts in addition it is difficult to predict how changes in economic conditions including changes resulting from various pandemic scenarios the impact of government stimulus and other relief programs could affect borrower behavior this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions details regarding the allowance and net chargeoffs including an analysis of activity from the previous years totals are included in table allowance for credit losses as noted above economic trends such as interest rates unemployment volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the cares act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net chargeoffs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of and beyond table 13allowance for credit losses nine months ended september  in millions

law on march certain loan modifications related to the covid19 pandemic beginning march through the earlier of days after the end of the pandemic or december are eligible for relief from tdr classification regions elected this provision of the cares act therefore modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered tdrs and are excluded from the disclosures below under regions covid19 deferral and forbearance programs customer payments are deferred for a period of time typically days during this time a customers loan is not considered past due and continues to accrue interest unless it is a nonperforming loan as of september the initial 90day deferral period had expired for the majority of covid19 modified loans see the third quarter overview section for details on deferrals as of september upon expiration of the deferral period customers may apply for additional relief or resume making payments on their loans repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower the cares act relief and shortterm nature of most covid19 deferrals precluded these modifications from being classified as tdrs as of september residential first mortgage home equity consumer credit card and other consumer tdrs are consumer loans modified under the cap commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be

over one fiscal yearend and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan for the consumer portfolio changes in tdrs are primarily due to additions from cap modifications and outflows from payments and chargeoffs given the types of concessions currently being granted under the cap as detailed in note loans and the allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved therefore regions expects consumer loans modified through cap to

experienced stress due to recent declines in demand brought on by the covid19 pandemic economic trends such as interest rates unemployment volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future level of nonperforming assets circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility at september regions estimates that the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to nonaccrual status in the next quarter is within the range of million to million in order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to nonaccrual at a future time depending upon the occurrence of future events a variety of factors are included in the assessment of potential problem loans including a borrowers capacity and willingness to meet contractual repayment terms make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity for other loans for example smaller dollar loans a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate of potential future downgrades in addition the economic environment and industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter current trends will additionally influence the size of the estimated range because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events the estimated range of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to an individual listing of loans many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans as well as other credit quality metrics are

carrying value refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for further discussion of when regions tests goodwill for impairment and the companys methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit the increase in goodwill from december was related to the companys acquisition of ascentium during the second quarter of the result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of did not indicate that the estimated fair values of the companys reporting units corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management had declined below their respective carrying values therefore regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of regions reporting units for the september interim period refer to note goodwill to the consolidated financial statements for further information deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness such as providing a high level of customer service competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers regions also serves customers through providing centralized highquality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet banking the following table summarizes deposits by category table 19deposits september december in millions noninterestbearing demand savings interestbearing transaction money marketdomestic time deposits customer deposits corporate treasury time deposits corporate treasury other deposits total deposits at september increased approximately billion compared to yearend levels due to increases in noninterestbearing demand savings interestbearing transaction and domestic money market categories these increases were partially offset by decreases in corporate treasury other deposits and customer time deposits noninterestbearing demand deposits continued to increase as customers have been bringing their elevated cash levels back to regions also businesses are focused on supply chain efficiencies and turnover of receivables which has increased their cash balances and resulting deposits savings interestbearing transaction and domestic money market categories increased due to customers choosing to keep excess cash from government stimulus and funds from ppp loans in their deposit accounts additionally consumers spending has declined due to the economic environment and consumers continue to adjust their spending and saving patterns which has led to an increase in deposit balances customer time deposits decreased due to maturities during the third quarter and continued lower interest rates during the third quarter resulted in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts corporate treasury other deposits decreased as these deposits were used to supplement incremental balance sheet funding at yearend but were not utilized at the end of the third quarter of shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which consist of fhlb advances were zero at september as compared to billion at december the levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the companys funding needs and the sources utilized fhlb borrowings decreased from december to september as the increase in deposits reduced the need for funding from the fhlb shortterm secured borrowings such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances are a core portion of regions funding strategy the securities financing market and specifically shortterm fhlb advances continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates see the liquidity section for

operating results of the company and predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations regions believes that presentation of these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management management and the board utilize these nongaap financial measures as follows preparation of regions operating budgets

effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a banks capital adequacy based on cet1 the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders equity measure because tangible common shareholders equity is not formally defined by gaap this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than regions disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders equity regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on this same basis nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as

compared to the same period in was driven by increases in loan balances attributable to ppp lending the companys april equipment finance company acquisition increased production of residential first mortgage loans a decrease in deposit costs and decreases in short and longterm borrowings through the redemption of bank senior notes and paydowns of fhlb advances net interest income also benefitted from the execution of the companys interest rate hedging strategy the hedges are designed to protect net interest income in a low shortterm interest rate environment such as the one that currently exists and had a positive impact of approximately million for the first nine months of of which million was realized in the three months ended september the hedging strategy produced no benefits before the declines in net interest margin for the third quarter and the first nine months of compared to the same periods in were primarily driven by elevated cash levels increases in loan balances due to ppp lending and loan production at lower market interest rates additionally net interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers to quantify this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points given low market rates by historical standards the company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based on historical minimums as explained in the following section in addition to parallel curve shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movements as of september regions was modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending september the third quarter continued the trend of strong balance sheet growth in lowcost deposits and cash balances held with the federal reserve these trends increase reported asset sensitivity levels in the nearterm however this is offset somewhat by the addition of approximately billion of fixedrate investment securities agency mbs and agency cmbs within the quarter the estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates the decline in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves and month libor will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates under that environment it is expected that declines in funding costs and increases in balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the decline in asset yields therefore net interest income sensitivity to shortterm rates is approximately neutral net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors a reduction in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swap and mortgage rates will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate newly originated or renewed loans reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the table below summarizes regions positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start within the measurement horizon more information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in table and its accompanying description table 25interest rate sensitivity estimated annual change in net interest income september in millions gradual change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted will reduce sensitivity levels into as they continue to move into the measurement horizon see table for additional information regarding hedge start dates the basis point floored scenario represents a month average rate shock of basis points and basis points to approximately zero for month libor and the year us treasury yield respectively mortgage yield shocks are floored at their historical minimums minus basis points as market interest rates increased in recent years regions had established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level the shock magnitude for each tenor when compared to market forward rates equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount or a rate basis points lower than the historical alltime minimum recent market volatility and new historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors have resulted in a shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to approximately zero mortgage rates which have retained somewhat elevated levels are still being shocked in the manner previously described further the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates the falling rate scenarios in table above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment as discussed above the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan growth and deposit normalization reflecting managements best estimate the behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles but with suitable adjustments based on managements expectations in the current environment in the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in table interestbearing deposit rates move into the single digits in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case balance sheet assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some shift from noninterest bearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the gradual basis point scenario in table since the end of regions has seen sizable deposit growth which has contributed to its higher interest rate risk sensitivity yeartodate the company estimates that every billion decline in total deposit balances would reduce nii sensitivity in table by approximately million and million in the gradual basis point and the gradual basis point floored shock scenarios respectively while estimates should be used as a guide differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes and other market competitive factors interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives as discussed below derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts eurodollar futures contracts interest rate swaps options on interest rate swaps interest rate caps and floors and forward sale commitments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variablerate loan portfolios to fixedrate regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this heldforsale portfolio futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing the following table presents additional

active the remaining million notional of interest rate swaps and million notional of interest rate floors become active in the first quarter of regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty all hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in regions annual report on form 10k for the year ended december contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account with changes in

will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct libor confirming that the continuation of libor will not be guaranteed beyond that date regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of libor including loans investments derivative products floatingrate obligations and other financial instruments that use libor as a benchmark rate the company has established a libor transition program which includes dedicated leadership and staff with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged as part of this program the company continues to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation unavailability or nonrepresentativeness of libor regions is also coordinating with regulatory agencies and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for contracts expiring after and preparing for this transition as it relates to both new and existing exposures significant uncertainty remains however steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by regions executive libor steering committee continuing activities of the libor transition program include facilitating the transition of all financial and strategic processes systems and models performing assessments of the transitions impact to contracts and products evaluating necessary operational and infrastructure enhancements to implement alternative benchmark rates and coordinating communications with customers in the third quarter of regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that reference libor see note recent accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for details market riskprepayment risk regions like most financial institutions is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgagerelated assets under different interest rate environments prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income for example mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment regions must reinvest these funds in loweryielding assets prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields conversely in a rising rate environment these assets will prepay at a slower rate resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity regions greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgagebacked securities portfolio the mortgage fixedrate loan portfolio and the residential msr all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates but rather due to changes in policies or programs related either directly or indirectly to the us governments governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of noneconomic factors the company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided further regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in noninterest income in the form of servicing income on the residential msrs regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management liquidity liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers regions maintains strong liquidity levels that position the company to respond to stressed environments as discussed below regions has a variety of liquidity sources which it continues to utilize to fund customer needs on march the

cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the companys funding requirements is important in order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank holding company and affiliate levels regions liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of months of debt service and other cash needs or a minimum cash balance of million cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled billion at september compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the risk committee of the board on a quarterly basis regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the bank and subsidiaries these minimum requirements are informed by internal stress testing measures which are reflective of regions portfolio and business mix the banks funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any reliance on shortterm unsecured sources risk limits are established by the board through its risk appetite statement and liquidity policy the companys board lroc and alco regularly review compliance with the established limits the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see note debt securities to the consolidated financial statements the agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds regions liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets although regions does not assume reliance on shortterm unsecured sources of funding the balance with the frb is the primary component of the balance sheet line item interestbearing deposits in other banks at september regions had approximately billion in cash on deposit with the frb an

characteristics section of the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type information security risk regions faces a variety of operational risks including information security risks information security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems have generally increased in recent years this trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons including the proliferation of new technologies increase in technologybased products and services used by us and our customers the growing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies the ability to conduct more financial transactions online and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees regions devotes significant financial and nonfinancial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of its information systems regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks as well as continue to develop and enhance controls processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access in addition regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of thirdparty relationships with vendors as a result of the covid19 pandemic regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the united states however the companys layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events regions system of internal controls also incorporates an organizationwide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the board to ensure effective and efficient resolution and if necessary disclosure of any matters the board is actively engaged in the oversight of regions continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the everevolving information security threat landscape the board monitors regions information management risk policies and practices primarily through its risk committee which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities risks associated with development infrastructure and cybersecurity approval and oversight of internal and thirdparty information security risk assessments strategies policies and programs and disaster recovery business continuity and incident response plans additionally the boards audit committee regularly reviews regions cybersecurity practices mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the chief information security officer risk management and internal audit the board annually reviews the information security program and through its various committees is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters regions participates in information sharing organizations such as fsisac to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack fsisac is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk it acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat vulnerability and incident information in a nonattributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership in addition to fsisac regions is a member of bits bits serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation these vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support regions in the event of a cyber event even though regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security as an additional security measure regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industryleading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time some of regions financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance even if regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks where customers have transacted business the fraud losses as well as the costs of investigations and reissuing new customer cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach regions may be required to incur significant expenses including with respect to remediation costs costs of implementing additional preventative measures addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan
