item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk executive overview management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of regions financial corporations regions or the company business particularly regarding its results cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within mda and the consolidated financial statements are included this summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided but should be read in conjunction with the entire mda and consolidated financial statements as well as the other sections of this annual report on s fluctuations in the gdp and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts management considers the current level of the allowance appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios managements determination of the appropriateness of the allowance requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods in addition bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected additionally changes in circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility managements estimate of the allowance for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments could be affected by estimates of losses inherent in various product types as a result of fluctuations in the internal and external factors mentioned above for pooled commercial and investor real estate accounts a percent increase in the pd for nondefaulted accounts and a percent increase in the lgd for all accounts would result in an increase to estimated inherent losses of approximately million losses on residential real estate mortgages home equity lending and other consumerrelated loans can be affected by such factors as collateral value loss severity and other internal and external factors mentioned above a percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million these pro forma analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions however they do not reflect an expected outcome for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses see note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements fair value measurements a portion of the companys assets and liabilities is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss these include debt securities available for sale mortgage loans held for sale equity investments with and without readily determinable market values residential msrs and derivative assets and liabilities from time to time the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loanproperty or fair value less estimated costs to sell the property for example the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information less estimated selling costs adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity managements objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from modelbased techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on companyspecific data level valuations these unobservable assumptions reflect the companys own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships goodwill totaled billion at both december and goodwill is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion accounting guidance permits the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value if based on the weight of the evidence the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value then an impairment test is not necessary if the company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value a twostep goodwill impairment test is performed in step one the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill to the extent that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value impairment is not indicated and no further testing is required conversely if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount step two must be performed step two consists of determining the implied estimated fair value of goodwill which is the net difference between the valuation adjustments of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill and the valuation adjustment to equity from step one of the reporting unit the carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets adverse changes in the economic environment declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill if the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount a loss which could be material would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed in performing the qualitative assessment the company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis recent operating performance including reporting unit performance changes in market capitalization regulatory actions and assessments changes in the business climate companyspecific factors and trends in the banking industry after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances the company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values therefore step one and step two of the goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary refer to note intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include a protracted decline in the companys market capitalization adverse business trends resulting from litigation andor regulatory actions higher loan losses forecasts of high unemployment levels future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds refer to note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements future federal rules and regulations eg such as those resulting from the doddfrank act andor a significant protraction in the current level of interest rates other material identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships are reviewed at least annually usually in the fourth quarter for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset these events could include loss of core deposits significant losses of credit card accounts andor balances increased competition or adverse changes in the economy to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount these events or circumstances if they occur could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated residential mortgage servicing rights regions has elected to measure and report its residential msrs using the fair value method although sales of residential msrs do occur residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available and are therefore level valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the fair value measurements section specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential msrs as a result regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type and contractual note rate and values its residential msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates discount rates escrow balances and servicing costs changes in interest rates prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential msrs which impacts earnings the carrying value of residential msrs was million at december based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december fair value of residential msrs by approximately percent million and percent million respectively conversely basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december fair value of residential msrs by approximately percent million and percent million respectively regions also estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately per loan or percent would result in a decline in the value of the residential msrs by approximately million the pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome refer to the residential mortgage servicing rights discussion in the balance sheet analysis section found later in this report income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect managements estimate of income taxes to be paid or received deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method the net balance is reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income the company utilizes forecasted pretax earnings adjusts for the estimated booktax differences and incorporates assumptions including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted for a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets refer to the income taxes section found later in this report the company is subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus the company is required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations the company will evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities the companys estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates any changes if they occur can be significant to the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows on december tax reform was enacted effective january tax reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from percent to percent see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details operating results net interest income and other financing income and net interest margin net interest income and other financing income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals net interest income and other financing income taxableequivalent basis increased million in compared to driven primarily by higher shortterm market interest rates higher average loan balances favorable loan remixing and securities repositioning the increases were largely offset by higher funding costs and the impact of lower longterm interest rates on asset pricing the net interest margin decreased to percent in from percent in as the increases in funding rates exceeded increases in yields on earning assets this is primarily attributed to market interest rate dynamics including the impact of remixing from lower yielding deposit products to higher yielding deposit products and debt instruments higher average loan balances also contributed to the decrease in net interest margin comparing to average earning asset yields were basis points higher while interestbearing liability rates were basis points higher as a result the net interest rate spread decreased basis points to percent in compared to percent in the federal reserve began to increase policy accommodation during through lowering its policy rate and resuming increases to its balance sheet this coupled with slowing global economic growth trends resulted in decreases in longterm interest rates in longterm interest rates are generally represented by the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasury note the average yield on the benchmark rate decreased to percent in compared to percent in however the taxable investment securities portfolio which contains significant residential fixedrate exposure increased in yield to percent in from percent in the yield increase was largely attributable to securities portfolio optimization strategies and reinvestment at higher longterm interest rate levels throughout and the first half of specifically the optimization strategies which were completed in included reducing the overall size of the portfolio through a combination of sales and maturities of lower yielding securities as well as the repositioning of agency mbs into prepayment protected securities primarily agency commercial mbs the loan portfolio also increased in yield to percent in from percent in the companys loan yields are primarily influenced by shortterm interest rates such as 30day libor while shortterm interest rates had declined by yearend the 30day libor averaged percent in compared to percent in reinvestment of fixed rate loans at higher longterm interest rates throughout and the first half of also contributed to the yield increase loan yields were also positively impacted by favorable remixing during including the intentional runoff of lower yielding auto loans which were replaced by higher yielding unsecured consumer loans the companys funding costs also increased in as compared to deposit costs increased to basis points for compared to basis points for the increase was due primarily to higher shortterm interest rates and portfolio remixing from lower

income taxes the companys income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended was million compared to income tax expense of million for the same period in resulting in effective tax rates of percent and percent respectively the effective tax rate is lower in the prior period principally due to tax benefits recognized due to tax reform the effective tax rate is affected by many factors including but not limited to the level of pretax income the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments bankowned life insurance taxexempt interest and nondeductible expenses in addition the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from periodtoperiod such as the termination of certain leveraged leases share based payments valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits accordingly the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted at december the company reported a net deferred tax liability of million compared to a net deferred asset of million at december the change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability was due principally to a change in the net market valuation adjustment related to available for sale securities and derivative instruments from a net loss to a net gain the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and negative evidence as part of this evaluative process the company considers the following sources of taxable income the future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and taxplanning strategies in making a conclusion the company has evaluated all available positive and negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income the

expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss cecl methodology upon the adoption of cecl the allowance is intended to cover expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost including unfunded commitments managements measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events including historical experience current conditions and rs forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported asset amount during the rs forecast period regions incorporated forwardlooking information by utilizing its internally formulated and approved base economic scenario the scenario was developed by the chief economist and approved by the scenario design committee the approved economic forecast considered market forwardconsensus information and was consistent with regions organizationwide economic outlook regions utilized a two year rs forecast period for all portfolio segments which closely aligned with other internal forecast periods key macroeconomic factors that regions utilized over the two year rs forecast period are as follows table start unemployment rates between and table

reverted to historical credit loss information regions reverts to ttc loss rates derived from taking the simple average of all historical quarterly observations for pd lgd ead and prepayment rates the mean reversion rate represents the weightedaverage of forecasted rs and ttc rates with the weight increasing exponentially over time the reversion periods for classes of commercial and investor real estate loans were six months to two years and the reversion periods for classes of consumer loans were between two and four years the length of the reversion period differed by portfolio segment depending on the time it takes for chargeoff rates to revert to the longterm average regions may adjust any andor all of the factors discussed above in future periods these assumptions and estimates will be monitored and challenged by appropriate corporate governance the cecl allowance is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist the allowance is calculated for most portfolios and classes using econometric models loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis while quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision regions adjusts the modeled allowance considering quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be directly measured in the modeled calculations regions qualitative framework provides for specific model adjustments and general imprecision adjustments specific model adjustments capture specific issues or events that are not adequately captured in model outcomes general imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision that are not separately identifiable or quantifiable and have not been captured by a specific model adjustment the table below summarizes the estimated allowance by portfolio segment upon adoption of cecl as compared to prior to adoption the cecl

outstanding december acl acl to loans acl acl to loans change commercial investor real estate consumer table end as shown in the table above the estimated increase in the allowance at adoption of cecl was primarily the result of significant increases within the consumer portfolio segment classes within the consumer segment that were most impacted include residential first mortgages home equity and indirectother consumer the impact to the residential first mortgage and home equity classes is mainly driven by their longer time to maturity additionally a significant portion of the indirectother consumer class is unsecured lending through third parties which yield higher loss rates under cecl these higher loss rates compounded over a life of loan estimate result in a significantly larger allowance estimate regions cecl estimate is sensitive to a number of factors which may differ depending on the portfolio or class changes in economic conditions or in regions assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of expected losses regions used its best judgment to assess economic conditions and loss data in estimating the cecl allowance and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes in underlying external or internal data for further information on the estimated impact upon adoption of cecl see note summary of significant accounting policies to the

fiscal yearend and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan for the consumer portfolio changes in tdrs are primarily due to additions from cap modifications and outflows from payments and chargeoffs given the types of concessions currently being granted under the cap as detailed in note allowance for credit losses to the

result in volatility at december regions had approximately million to million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not included in nonaccrual loans but for which management had concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms this is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to nonaccrual status in the next quarter in order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to nonaccrual at a future time depending on the occurrence of future events these personnel consider a variety of factors including the borrowers capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity based upon the consideration of these factors a probability weighting is assigned to loans to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans during this specific time period additionally for other loans for example smaller dollar loans a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the estimate of potential future downgrades because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events the estimate of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to

deposits deposit costs increased to basis points for compared to basis points for and basis points for the rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to percent in compared to percent for and percent for the increases are largely due to portfolio remixing resulting from the rise of shortterm rates in late that remained elevated during the first half of the portfolio remixing stabilized in late as the fomc reduced its shortterm policy rate low deposit costs are driven primarily by the composition of the companys deposit base which includes a significant amount of lowcost and relatively
