diluted net income per common share for the year ended december was compared to fully diluted net income per common share of and for the years ended december and respectively at december loans had increased by billion to billion from billion at december results of operations our net interest income increased to billion for compared to billion for and million for the increase in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio partially offsetting the increase was the continued rising cost of funds in as a result of the elevated shortterm interest rate environment increased onbalance sheet liquidity the competitive pressures on deposits in our markets and increased reliance on brokered deposits and other sources of noncore funding the increase in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the interest and fees related to ppp loans and discount accretion associated with fair value adjustments as well as the rising cost of funds in net interest income in and was affected by fluctuations in our net interest spread and for was materially impacted by income on ppp loans the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for was compared to and for and respectively our provision for credit losses was million for compared to million in and million in the increase in provision expense as compared to prior years is due to growth in the loan portfolio and the continuing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment which impacts the projected macroeconomic factors used in our cecl modeling also contributing to provision expense in all periods was net chargeoffs which were million during compared to million in and million in noninterest income for compared to increased by million or to million from million the growth in noninterest income for compared to was in large part attributable to million in gains on the sale of fixed assets as a result of a sale leaseback transaction that was completed in the second quarter of pursuant to which we sold branch locations and agreed to individually lease these locations back for an initial term of years noninterest income was also positively impacted by wealth management revenues of million for the year ended december compared to million for the same period in the prior year these increases were in part offset by a decrease in income from our equity method investment in bankers healthcare group llc bhg of million or to million for the year ended december from million for the same period in the prior year additionally losses on the sale of investment securities negatively impacted noninterest income by million during the year ended december compared to the same prior year period noninterest income for compared to increased by million or the growth in noninterest income for compared to was in large part attributable to an increase in income from our equity method investment in bhg of million or during the year ended december compared to the same period in the prior year additionally positively impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of million for the year ended december compared to million for the same period in the prior year other noninterest income which is the result of among other things fee revenue lines of business other than those specifically identified on the face of our consolidated income statement also increased during the year ended december by million when compared to the same period in the prior year due in part to increases in interchange and other consumer fees when compared to and a million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in jbb capital llc jbb resulting from our bank subsidiarys acquisition on march of the equity interest of jbb it did not previously own the above increases were partially offset by a decrease in income from other equity investments of million during when compared to as a result of several of our venture fund investments experiencing increased valuations in their underlying portfolios during the year ended december but at lower amounts than those experienced during the same period in as well as gains on mortgage loans sold net which decreased by million for the year ended december as compared to primarily due to the increases in the interest rate environment noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or to million from million impacting noninterest expense for the year ended december as compared to was a million or increase in salaries and employee benefits a million or increase in equipment and occupancy expenses and a million special assessment by the fdic which was assessed in the fourth quarter of as a result of the bank failures which occurred in the first half of the change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to fulltime equivalent associates at december from at december as well as annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of equipment and occupancy expenses increased during the year ended december as compared to as a result of the sale leaseback transaction which was completed during the second quarter of offsetting a portion of these increases for compared to were cash and equity incentive expense of million which were million or lower in than in noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or impacting noninterest expense for the year ended december as compared to was the million increase in salaries and employee benefits the change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to fulltime equivalent associates at december from at december as well as annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of also contributing to the increase for compared to were cash and equity incentive expense of million which were million or higher in than in noninterest expense categories other than salaries and employee benefits were million during compared to million during this increase is due primarily to overall growth in the infrastructure of the firm additional locations added in and new technology implemented in during the three years ended december and we recorded income tax expense of million million and million respectively our effective tax rate for the years ended december and was and respectively our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and for the three years ended december and respectively the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue the efficiency ratio for the year ended december compared to the same period in and in as compared to were both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to noninterest expense net interest income and noninterest income discussed above with increases to noninterest expense slightly outpacing the growth in income during and net income for was

noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series b series b preferred stock in the second quarter of fullydiluted net income per common share was for compared to for and for net income in was impacted positively by organic growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio as well as gains on the sale of fixed assets as a result of the sale leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of and negatively impacted by higher costs of funds and increases in salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy costs a decrease in income from our equity method investment in bhg and the fdic special assessment as noted above net income in was impacted positively by organic growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio as well as increased earnings from our equity method investment in bhg and negatively impacted by higher costs of funds and increases in salaries and employee benefits fullydiluted net income per common share in all periods presented was also impacted by the dividends paid on the series b preferred stock financial condition our loan balances increased by billion or to billion during as compared to the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets including the markets in which we recently expanded increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company including those of newly hired relationship advisors loan growth has also been positively impacted by the continued growth of certain specialty lending groups including franchise lending and equipment lease financing as well as our strategic market expansions during we made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our underwriting particularly in construction and cre investment property and our loan growth rates are reflective of this tightening at december our allowance for credit losses on loans was million or of total loans compared to million or of total loans at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans is largely the result of growth in the loan portfolio and our cecl modeling which utilizes projected macroeconomic factors which are impacted by the current economic environment total deposits increased from billion at december to billion at december an increase of billion or interestbearing deposit growth during the year ended december increased approximately billion or from december as a result of our continued intentional focus on gathering and retaining these deposits and a shift by our customers into these deposits to take advantage of increased rates within our deposits the ratio of core funding to total deposits decreased from at december to at december this change is largely due to an increase in fhlb advances during the year ended december which impacted our level of noncore funding by yearoveryear this increase was the result of our decision in the first half of to increase our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity in response to the uncertain and challenging economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple highprofile banking institutions we believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve as such we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing smalland middlemarket clients particularly if the economies in our principal markets continue to expand capital and liquidity at december and our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations from time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary at december we had approximately million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock the authorization for this program remained in effect through march on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on march this authorization is to remain in effect through march we did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during the years ended december or respectively on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock to commence upon expiration of our existing share repurchase program that is set to expire on march this authorization is to remain in effect through march critical accounting estimates the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with us generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry in connection with the application of those principles we have made judgments and estimates which in the case of the determination of our allowance for credit losses and the assessment of impairment of goodwill has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations allowance for credit losses loans the allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated under the cecl methodology set forth in fasb asc the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects managements estimate of the the amount of credit losses expected to be recognized over the remaining life of the loans in our portfolio this evaluation requires significant management judgment and is based upon relevant available information related to historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions and other portfoliospecific and environmental risk factors losses are predicted over a reasonable and supportable forecast period and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses revert to long term historical averages the allowance for credit losses on loans is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis there are factors beyond our control such as changes in projected economic conditions real estate markets or particular industry conditions which may materially impact asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans and thus the resulting provision for credit losses the allowance is adjusted through provision for credit losses and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff see allowance for credit losses on loans elsewhere within this section as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and allowance for credit losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses on loans impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described in asc currently our annual assessment date is september accordingly we performed a qualitative assessment by examining changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors and other relevant entityspecific events including changes in the share price of our common stock while we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing are appropriate they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include significant fluctuations in our assetliability balances or the composition of our balance sheet a change in the overall valuation of the stock market specifically bank stocks performance of southeast us banks and our performance relative to peers changes in these assumptions or any other key assumptions could have a material impact on our qualitative assessment resulting in the decision to perform additional procedures to identify and determine the amount of goodwill impairment if any should it be determined in a future period that goodwill has become impaired then a charge to earnings would be recorded in the period such determination is made see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements for additional

of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately billion which resulted in a net interest margin of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of the increase in net interest income in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio offset in part by continued rising costs of funds in due to the elevated shortterm interest rate environment increased onbalance sheet liquidity the competitive rate environment for deposits in our markets and increased reliance on brokered deposits and other sources of noncore funding the increase in net interest income in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the interest and fees related to ppp loans and discount accretion associated with fair value adjustments as well as the rising cost of funds in the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions

margin for the year ended december reflects the elevated shortterm interest rate environment as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets and the impact of the increased onbalance sheet liquidity we intentionally acquired in the first half of as a response to the then current macroeconomic environment and the failures of multiple highprofile financial institutions during the year ended december our earning asset yield increased by basis points and basis points from the years ended december and respectively while total funding rates increased by basis points and basis point compared to the years ended december and respectively our net interest margin for the year ended december reflects the rising shortterm interest rate environment including the impact of exceeding substantially all of our loan floors during the second and third quarters of and the deployment of excess funds in higher yielding loans offset in part by the diminishing impact of loans made and fees recognized pursuant to the ppp declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets we seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits but subject to internal policy limits on the amount of noncore funding we may maintain will utilize noncore funding to fund shortfalls if any or provide additional liquidity to the extent that our dependence on noncore funding sources increases as was the case in and our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits should rates begin to decline we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations during the federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates by basis points our most likely forecast for shortterm rates through is mostly consistent with the federal funds futures markets expectations for rate movements however there is much uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets due to the persistent elevated levels of inflation present in the economy the resiliency of the employment environment and consumer spending and what risks these present for a recession to occur in the near and medium term rate and volume analysis net interest income increased by million between the years ended december and and by million between the years ended december and the following is an analysis of the changes in our net

volume change or changes in average rates rate change for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses the provision for credit losses amounted to million million and million for the years ended december and respectively provision expense is impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio recent historical and projected future economic conditions and net chargeoffs the increase in provision expense during as compared to and and as compared to is due to growth in the loan portfolio and the uncertain and challenging economic environment which negatively impacts the projected macroeconomic factors used in our cecl modeling also contributing to the provision expense in when compared to the and comparable periods was net chargeoffs which totaled million million and million respectively our allowance for credit losses on loans reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses in the loan portfolio as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses assessment methodology at december our allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was an increase from at december noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth while investment services fees from the origination of mortgage loans swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period the following is our noninterest income for the years ended december and in thousands table start years ended december percent increase decrease year ended december percent increase decrease noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts investment services insurance sales commissions gains on mortgage loans sold net investment gains losses on sales net trust fees income from equity method investment gain on sale of fixed assets other noninterest income interchange and other consumer fees bankowned life insurance loan swap fees sba loan sales income from other equity investments other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income table end the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in compared to and compared to is largely the result of increased transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the increased economic activity in our markets in each of the periods presented during the second half of we implemented changes to our insufficient funds programs as a result of which we eliminated nsf fees on consumer accounts reduced overdraft fees paid for items established an overdraft cushion of for consumers and reduced the maximum number of overdraft paid item charges per day we expect future service charge revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by these changes as was the case in income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank and fees from our wealth advisory group pnfp capital markets inc were million for the year ended december compared to million during and million during reflecting increases in brokerage assets at december pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion in brokerage assets compared to billion and billion at december and respectively revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance agency subsidiaries were approximately million during compared to million and million during and respectively additionally at december our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion and billion of managed and custodied assets respectively compared to approximately billion and billion at december and billion and billion at december we believe the improvement in the results of our wealth management businesses in compared to and compared to is primarily attributable to an increased number of wealth management advisors and corresponding client acquisition as well as improved market performance gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising and elevated interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million million and million respectively for the years ended december and the decreases in compared to and compared to are the direct result of the increased rate environment negatively impacting both refinancing and new purchase originations we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline the hedge is not designated as a hedge for gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement the change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at december the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at december expected to close in investment gains and losses on sales net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our availableforsale securities portfolio during the periods noted for the year ended december investment gains losses on sales net represent a million net pretax loss we recognized upon the sale of million of investment securities compared to a net pretax gain we recognized upon the sale of million of investment securities in compared to a net pretax gain on the sale of million of investment securities in during and in connection with the saleleaseback transaction we restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio to reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding securities for any securities classified as availableforsale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date we assess whether or not we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a writedown to fair value through net income because we currently do not intend to sell those availableforsale securities that have an unrealized loss at december and it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases which may be maturity we have determined that no writedown is necessary gains on the sale of fixed assets were million and respectively for the years ended december and respectively the increase in gains on the sale of fixed assets for the year ended december was primarily the result of the saleleaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of and included the sale of properties for which pinnacle bank will separately lease each of those properties for an initial term of years with two five year renewal options that may be exercised to extend the term of any of the leases the pretax net gain recorded associated with the sale of these properties was million after deducting transactionrelated expenses income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg prior to september we held a portion of this investment at pinnacle financial and a portion at pinnacle bank effective september pinnacle financial contributed of the equity interests of bhg owned by it to pinnacle bank bhg is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors income from this equitymethod investment was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively as more fully described below the decrease in income from bhg during the year ended december as compared to the same period in the prior year is largely the result of increases in i the liability for estimated future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio of loans sold to banks through the auction platform that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment and ii the allowance for credit losses for loans bhg has retained on its balance sheet due to the impact of the uncertain and challenging economic environment on the macroeconomic factors in its allowance model the increased level of contribution we experienced from bhg in as compared to reflects the positive results bhg experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model including its marketing efforts historically bhg has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option in recent years bhg began an effort to retain more loans on its balance sheet bhgs decision to sell loans through its auction platform or recently directly to institutional investors or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors including interest rates as well as demand levels from the community bank network of buyers and institutional buyers to whom bhg markets these loans in a rising rate environment it may choose to sell more loans through its auction platform if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale either directly such as during when bhg sold loans totaling approximately billion to asset managers or through its auction platform bhg also entered into funding facilities in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of including a facility with a us asset manager with outstanding balances of million and million at december and december respectively and an annualized interest rate at december of approximately these facilities which are secured by loans on bhgs balance sheet represent incremental funding sources to bhg since bhg has completed eight securitizations totaling billion with the latest securitization of million having been completed in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that bhg will complete additional securitizations in the future or otherwise establish other borrowing facilities to facilitate the retention of additional loans on bhgs balance sheet additionally during bhg recorded several expenses related to the write down of a building that bhg anticipates selling as well as certain software assets and other items that were related to business lines that bhg has elected to exit these charges amounted to approximately million during income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of and for the years ended december and respectively at december there were million of these intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair value of certain of bhgs liabilities of and million for the years ended december and respectively at december there were of these liabilities that are expected to be accreted into income in lesser amounts over the next three years during the year ended december pinnacle bank received dividends from bhg of million compared to million and million received by pinnacle bank and pinnacle financial in the aggregate during the years ended december and respectively dividends from bhg during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated our proportionate share of earnings from bhg is included in our consolidated tax return bhg partners with third party lenders including pinnacle bank to facilitate loan originations as part of bhgs alternative financing portfolio whereby bhg acts as the marketing firm and refers loans to the third party lenders for funding the third party lenders receive a fee for each loan funded and subsequently sold to bhg these loans are ultimately sold through bhgs network of clients which includes pinnacle bank during the years ended december and respectively bhg purchased billion billion and million respectively of loans originated by pinnacle bank as part of this program during the years ended december pinnacle bank purchased no loans from bhg compared to purchases of million and million respectively of loans during the years ended december and from bhg at par pursuant to bhgs joint venture loan program whereby bhg and pinnacle bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase the yield on this portfolio to pinnacle bank is anticipated to be between and per annum at december and there were million and million respectively of bhg joint venture program loans held by pinnacle bank as our ownership interest in bhg is and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on bhgs board of managers we do not consolidate bhgs results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of bhgs activities at our percentage ownership in income from equitymethod investment in noninterest income for the year ended december bhg reported billion in gross revenues net of substitution and prepayment losses of million compared to billion and million in gross revenues respectively for the years ended december and net of substitution and prepayment losses of million and million respectively earnings from bhg are likely to fluctuate from periodtoperiod approximately million or of bhgs revenues for the year ended december related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to million or for the year ended december and million or for the year ended december these loans have typically been sold by bhg with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan although the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model at december and there were billion and billion respectively of these loans previously sold by bhg that were being actively serviced by the purchasing banks bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments as a result bhg maintained a liability as of december and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future losses for the outstanding previously sold loan portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment this liability represents and respectively of loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of december and respectively the change in this liability for the year ended december compared to the year ended december was principally the result of an increase in the amount of loans sold by bhg to financial institutions and changes in bhg managements estimate of future substitution losses due to uncertain and challenging economic conditions in addition to these loans that bhg sells into its auction market at december bhg reported balance sheet loans totaling billion compared to billion as of december a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at december and bhg had billion and billion respectively of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment at december bhg reported an allowance for credit losses totaling million and an allowance for loan losses totaling million at december with respect to the loans on its balance sheet the increase in allowance for credit losses for the year ended december compared to the year ended december was principally the result of growth in the balance sheet loan portfolio the uncertain and challenging economic environment and bhgs adoption of cecl effective october upon adoption of cecl bhgs balance for the allowance for credit losses increased by million through retained earnings pinnacle bank recorded its proportionate share of the impact of bhgs cecl adoption by recording a million entry to reduce retained earnings net of deferred taxes with corresponding entries to the equity method investment in bhg and deferred taxes prior to october bhg recorded its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method interest income and fees associated with these onbalance sheet loans amounted to million million and million for the years ended december and respectively pinnacle bank has a participating interest in a million revolving line of credit for the benefit of bhg in the amount of million at december there was million in outstanding balance on the line related to pinnacle banks interest in the line the line accrues interest at sofr plus basis points and is secured by all assets of bhg the credit agreement contains covenants requiring bhg to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain other affirmative and negative covenants at december neither bhg nor the originating bank had represented to pinnacle bank that bhg was not in compliance in all material respects with these covenants included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased during the year ended december as compared to the same period in due primarily to increased commercial credit card volumes periodoverperiod other noninterest income also included changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance boli which was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable during the fourth quarter of we restructured approximately million of bank owned life insurance contracts boli held by various insurance carriers and in connection therewith incurred approximately million in restructuring charges and surrender penalties and million in income taxes and penalties the restructuring is expected to increase the future yields of the underlying insurance contracts and is expected to be fully phased in by midyear and should result in an increase in nontaxable noninterest income of approximately million in from what would have been the case without the restructuring during we purchased an additional million of bank owned life insurance loan swap fees increased by million and during the year ended december as compared to the same periods in and respectively due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environment sba loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market conditions which is reflected in the decrease in as compared to additionally the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investment income related to these investments decreased million during to million when compared to and million to million during when compared to each as a result of several of our venture fund investments experiencing increased valuations in their underlying portfolios during the year ended december but at lower amounts than those experienced during the same period in and the other components of other noninterest income increased million in when compared to and million in when compared to the change in compared to is in part due to a million gain on a life insurance claim million in gains on the sale of other assets and a million increase in miscellaneous other income offset in part by the absence in of the million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in jbb recorded

which was completed during the second quarter of offsetting a portion of these increases for compared to were cash and equity incentives which were million or lower in than in the increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in over and over was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to fulltime equivalent associates at december from at december and at december as well as annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of each respective year also contributing to total salaries and employee benefits in both periods were cash and equity incentives of million which were down million or in versus and up million or to million in versus in both cases due to our ability or failure to meet performance targets in each period we expect salary and benefit expenses will rise in compared to as a result of our continued focus on hiring experienced bankers in our markets our increased associate base and annual merit increases given in the first quarter of each fiscal year and the belief that we will achieve at least a target level of performance for our annual cash and equity incentive plans which we did not achieve in commissions expense represents compensation paid to our wealth management lines of business including investment services trust insurance and capital markets commissions expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in the increase in as compared to and as compared to is primarily related to growth in our investment portfolio commissions as a result of increased activity in our wealth management lines of business and an increase in the number of wealth management associates commissions expense incurred related to the production of residential mortgages is recorded net of the related mortgage revenues we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions all of our banks noncommissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and nearly all of our banks associates participate in our equity compensation plans under the annual cash incentive plan the targeted level of incentive payments required achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of annual revenue and annual earnings per common share in each case subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenue and earnings per common share are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of

equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for nearly all of our banks associates a significant portion of which is performancebased for our senior executive officers we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization our compensation expense associated with performancebased vesting equity awards was up slightly for the year ended december when compared to and increased million in when compared to the same period in in each of the years ended december and we again granted performancebased vesting equity awards with performance metrics tied to peer relative performance for return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share accretion together with a total shareholder return tsr modifier in the case of awards for our most senior executives in each case over a threeyear performance period we also approved a special performancebased vesting restricted stock unit award to each of our named executive officers and our thenserving chief credit officer in with performance metrics tied to the ratio of our price to earnings and price to tangible book value per share relative to those measures for a peer group of companies over a threeyear performance period our compensation expense associated with performancebased equity awards for and exceeded those levels that we recorded in our compensation expense associated with equity awards with timebased vesting criteria increased million during when compared to and million during when compared to the change in this balance is a product of the change in the number of associates during the respective periods

various points ranging from through at december our total minimum operating lease commitment was million equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in the increase in as compared to is in large part due to the saleleaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of as discussed above additionally impacting equipment and occupancy expense in as compared to were costs associated with the opening of five new locations across our footprint in as well as costs associated with the planned relocation of our corporate headquarters to a new location in early which we announced in the increases in as compared to are in part the result of the five new office locations that were opened across our footprint during the

is summarized as follows dollars in thousands table start amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial real estate owneroccupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans table end at december our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at december at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owneroccupied commercial real estate properties compared to at december owneroccupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate additionally the construction and land development segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development in the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial residential and land during due in large part to the uncertain economic environment we made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our loan underwriting particularly in nonowner occupied commercial real estate and construction and our loan growth rates are reflective of this tightening the following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at december according to contractual maturities of one year or less after one but within five years after five but within fifteen years and after

the above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments loans totaling billion at their contractual floor rate at december are presented as fixed interest rate loans in the table above loan origination risk management we maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loans in our portfolio loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming loans diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable inventory or equipment some loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis commercial real estatemortgage loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property in the case of income producing property or the borrowers business if owneroccupied to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors if any commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy as detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly we believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow collateral geography and risk grade criteria we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates financial analysis of the developers and property owners and expectations of the permanent mortgage market among other items construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project which may be inaccurate construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property refinancing in the permanent mortgage market or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we also originate consumer loans including consumer realestate loans where we typically use a computerbased credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers seeks to minimize risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements we also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the risk committee of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures lending concentrations we periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries we use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications we have a credit exposure loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments exceeding of pinnacle banks total riskbased capital to borrowers in the following industries at december and in thousands table start at december outstanding principal balances unfunded commitments total exposure total exposure at december lessors of nonresidential buildings lessors of residential buildings new housing forsale builders music publishers table end banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction and land development ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at december and pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and respectively nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans including construction and development loans were and of total riskbased capital for december and respectively pinnacle bank was within the and guidelines throughout and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the and thresholds over the longterm though there may be periods where we exceed these levels if loan growth is more heavily weighted to these types of loans loans in past due status the following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least days but less than days and days or more past due as of december and  in thousands table start december december loans past due to days commercial

end potential problem loans potential problem loans amounted to approximately million or of total loans outstanding at december compared to million or of total loans outstanding at december potential problem loans which are not included in nonperforming loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse but not considered nonperforming loans approximately million of the potential problem loans were past due at least but less than days as of december nonperforming assets and modified loans at december we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonaccruing loans

december there were million of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty approximately million of those loans were subsequently past due and had a payment default in the months following modification all nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan the special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses typically these special assets officers review our loan files interview prior officers assigned to the relationship meet with borrowers inspect collateral reappraise collateral andor consult with legal counsel the special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists which could include foreclosing on collateral restructuring the loan issuing demand letters or other actions we discontinue the accrual of interest income when there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or the principal or interest is more than days past due unless the loan is both wellsecured and in the process of collection during and we recognized no interest income related to nonaccruing loans at december and our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccruing loans totaled and respectively allowance for credit losses on loans allowance the current expected credit losses cecl methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio accordingly the allowance for credit losses on loans represents an amount that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of december and our allowance for credit losses on loans was million and million respectively which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was at december increased from at december during the second quarter of we implemented updated cecl models in an effort to ensure that risk in our portfolio at an individual loan level continues to be adequately captured given the uncertain state of the economy the implementation of the new model had no material effect on the overall allowance for credit losses on loans in the quarter of implementation our cecl models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses macroeconomic factors used in the model include the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate gdp commercial property price index consumer credit commercial real estate price index household debt ratio household financial obligations ratio and certain home price indices projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages at december a reasonable and supportable period of fifteen months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages the following table sets forth based on managements best estimate the allocation of the allowance

consumer and commercial loans held for sale pinnacle financials management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans on a quarterly basis this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at december while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses investments our investment portfolio consisting primarily of us treasury securities federal agency bonds state and municipal securities and mortgagebacked securities amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively our investment securities to asset ratio was

sold million of investment securities for a net pretax loss of million compared to million of investment securities for a net pretax gain of during and million of investment securities for a net pretax gain of during these sales were implemented as part of our efforts to reposition our investment portfolio to provide our balance sheet more protection from the then anticipated rate environment

pinnacle banks cash accounts at the federal reserve restricted cash our restricted cash balances totaled approximately million and million at december and respectively this restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio the increase in restricted cash is attributable primarily to an increase in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has decreased see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k securities purchased with agreement to resell at december and we had million and million respectively in securities purchased with agreement to resell this balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties we initially secured these investments to allow us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment the current repurchase agreements are set to mature in deposits and other borrowings we had approximately billion of deposits at december compared to billion billion at december our deposits consist of noninterest and interestbearing demand accounts savings accounts money market accounts and time deposits at december and we estimate that we had approximately billion and billion respectively in uninsureduncollateralized deposits which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit additionally we entered into agreements with certain customers to sell certain of our securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day these agreements which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our commercial clients and provide the client with shortterm returns for their excess funds amounted to million at december and million at december average balances for these repurchase agreements were million in million in and million in additionally at december we had borrowed billion in advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb cincinnati compared to million at december the increase in fhlb advances during the year ended december was the result of our decision in the first half of to increase our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity in response to the uncertain and challenging economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple highprofile banking institutions at december we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by us and the subsequent approval by the fhlb

funding is necessary to complement our core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives our asset liability management policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits increased in but remained within those policy limitations as of december the amount of time deposits as of december amounted to billion the following table

pinnacle bank common equity tier capital pinnacle financial pinnacle bank tier capital to average assets pinnacle financial pinnacle bank table end average assets for the above calculations were based on the most recent quarter we and our bank subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our financial condition or results of operations under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action we and our bank subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets liabilities and certain offbalancesheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices our and pinnacle banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors as permitted by the interim final rule issued on march by the federal banking regulatory agencies we and our bank subsidiary have each elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital of pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks adoption of asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which was effective january the initial impact of adoption of asu as well as of the quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses subsequent to adoption of asu collectively the transition adjustments was delayed until december as of january the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments became fixed and is being phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three year period with recognized in recognized in and recognized in beginning on january the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels share repurchase program on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock pursuant to which we have acquired no shares of our common stock the authorization for this program will remain in effect through march on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock to commence upon expiration of our existing share repurchase program that is set to expire on march this authorization is to remain in effect through march dividends pursuant to tennessee banking law pinnacle bank may not without the prior consent of the tdfi pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years during the year ended december pinnacle bank paid dividends of million to us which was within the limits allowed by the tdfi during the year ended december we paid million in dividends to common shareholders on january our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders approximately million in aggregate that was paid on february to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on february during the year ended december we paid million of dividends on our series b preferred stock on january our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend approximately million in aggregate that will be paid on march to preferred shareholders of record as of the close of business on february this dividend equates to per share on our depositary shares the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including if necessary our receipt of dividends from pinnacle bank regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiarys financial results if we fail to pay dividends on our series b preferred stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated table start estimated change in net interest income over months december december instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease table end while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at december our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at december our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates table start december december instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease table end while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at december our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario assumes four basis point decreases in the federal funds rate during with the first decrease occurring in the second quarter of our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at december we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue this policy if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis as noted previously pinnacle bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati and pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the fhlb cincinnati has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firms alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the fhlb cincinnati at december we believe we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at december or during the year then ended although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically pinnacle bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit and the federal reserves new bank term funding program btfp lines of credit at december the btfp is a new facility established in response to liquidity concerns within the banking industry following the failures of multiple highprofile financial institutions in the first half of the btfp was designed to provide available additional funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors under the program eligible depository institutions can obtain loans of up to one year in length by pledging us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and other qualifying assets as collateral these assets will be valued at par on january the federal reserve announced that the btfp will cease making new loans on march we have no borrowings outstanding under the btfp banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at december we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint including the markets to which we have recently expanded and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense if we were to breach the terms of one of the leases entered into in the saleleaseback transaction and the counterparty terminated the lease in accordance with its terms we may be forced to expend significant amounts of capital expenditures to lease procure and build or renovate a suitable replacement branch additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with planned technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm our shortterm borrowings borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns on their excess funds we have certain contractual obligations as of december which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to december each of these commitments is noted throughout item managements discussion and analysis our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments including loan commitments and reasonable borrower depositor and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longerterm as well offbalance sheet arrangements at december we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of billion because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements if needed to fund these outstanding commitments pinnacle bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities availableforsale or on a shortterm basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions we follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for onbalance sheet instruments each customers creditworthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis and the amount of collateral obtained if any is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer however should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us our maximum exposure to credit loss without consideration of collateral is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments at december we had accrued million related to expected credit losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity risk management does not eliminate risk but seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and reward including return which is critical to optimizing shareholder value understanding our risks and managing them appropriately can enhance our ability to make better decisions deliver on objectives and improve performance our board of directors and members of senior management have identified major categories of risk capital risk liquidity risk credit risk market risk strategic risk reputational risk cybersecurity risk information technology risk climate sustainability risk bsaamlofac risk compliance risk asset liability management risk hr employment practices risk and nonbank activities risk role of management the chief risk officer reports directly to the boards risk committee and administratively to the chief executive officer providing overall vision direction and leadership regarding the enterprise risk management framework during the framework included an enterprise wide risk management committee chaired by the chief risk officer and various managementlevel risk committees that focus on specific areas of risk management the enterprise wide risk management committee which is a management committee consisting of key employees of the company including the companys chief risk officer chief executive officer chief financial officer cso chief credit officer deputy chief credit officer treasurer and chief compliance officer as well as other nonvoting members including the companys chief audit executive the nonvoting members of the committee include other key leaders responsible for critical operation and support functions and provide management oversight of our enterprisewide risk management program additional managementlevel risk committees are responsible for effective risk measurement management and reporting of their respective risk categories the chief risk officer is an active member of each of the managementlevel risk committees risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our risk committee and enterprise wide risk management committee we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks our risk committee in collaboration with our enterprise wide risk management committee approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk environment with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof are regularly presented to our various managementlevel risk oversight and planning committees and to the risk committee of our board of directors as noted above we have an enterprise wide risk management committee comprised of key members of senior management the purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk within the tolerances and framework established by our risk committee and board of directors the chairman of our enterprise wide risk management committee reports on a regular basis to the risk committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprisewide risk profile and other significant risk management

well as the physical and transition risks of our company the corporate social responsibility management committee is responsible for managing and implementing policy regarding certain human capital risk both from an associate perspective as well as a supplier perspective additionally our enterprise wide risk management committee regularly assesses our enterprisewide risk profile and key and emerging risk issues during the company intends to modify its current risk management framework in an effort to enhance overall risk oversight and foster more granular risk assessment discussions within pinnacle a new management committee led by the chief risk officer and including the leadership of pinnacles risk management group as well as several current members of the enterprisewide risk management team are expected to be added to the risk management framework of the company this committee is expected to meet each quarter and review materials detailing the pinnacle banks overall risk profile as well as identify the most critical and emerging risks then faced by pinnacle this information will then be considered by the broader enterprisewide risk management team subsequently the chief risk officer will share the independent risk assessment information with pinnacles senior leadership team which includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief credit officer chief of staff chief audit executive market leaders and the cso ultimately this information will be presented to the risk committee of the board of directors for their review the materials presented to the risk committee will summarize pinnacles risk profile as well as critical and emerging risks detail all material instances where the chief risk officers assessment of risk differs from that of pinnacles senior management and highlight instances where risks exceed the boards previouslyestablished risk appetite tolerance levels role of the board of directors in its oversight role of our risk management function our board of directors acting principally but not exclusively through a risk committee comprised solely of independent directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the risk

allocated to other committees of the board of directors that meet regularly and report to our board of directors including the audit climate sustainability and human resources and compensation committees our board of directors has approved a risk appetite statement from management that seeks to balance the amount of risk we are willing to take as we seek to achieve our financial performance objectives ie growth soundness and returns as such our board of directors principally acting through the risk committee routinely monitors a host of risk metrics from both business and operational units as well as by risk category in an effort to appropriately balance the manner in which our performance aligns with our risk appetite the risk committee and members of senior management including
