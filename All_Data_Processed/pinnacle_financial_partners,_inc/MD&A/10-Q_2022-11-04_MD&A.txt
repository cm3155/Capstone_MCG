operations for the three and nine months ended september and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december form 10k and the other reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission since we filed that form 10k overview general our diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended september was and respectively compared to and respectively for the same periods in at september loans increased to billion as compared to billion at december and total deposits increased to billion at september from billion at december results of operations our net interest income increased to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the prior year representing increases of million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the comparable periods in this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the interest and fees related to ppp loans and discount accretion associated with fair value adjustments as well as the rising cost of funds in the quarter and yeartodate periods in the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for the three and nine months ended september was and respectively compared to and respectively for the same periods in and reflects the rising shortterm interest rate environment including the impact of exceeding substantially all of our loan floors during the second and third quarters of and the deployment of excess funds in higher yielding loans offset in part by the diminishing impact of loans made and fees recognized pursuant to the ppp declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets our provision for credit losses was million and million for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million for the same periods in the increase in provision expense as compared to the same periods in is primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment also contributing to the provision expense for the three and nine months ended september were net chargeoffs totaling million and million respectively compared to million and million for the same periods in noninterest income increased by or and million or respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the growth was in part attributable to an increase in wealth management revenues which were million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively in the same periods in the prior year as well as an increase in income from our equity method investment in bhg of million or and million or respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the prior year service charges on deposit accounts decreased and increased million respectively during the three and nine months ended september due to fluctuations in transaction volumes in these accounts and the previously disclosed changes to our firms insufficient funds and overdraft programs during the third quarter of additionally the carrying values of other equity investments we have made are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investments income related to these investments decreased million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the prior year as we experienced greater increases in certain of our venture fund investment valuations due to changes in the valuations in their underlying portfolios during the three and nine months ended september than was the case in the three and nine months ended september loan swap fees decreased by and increased by million respectively during the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environments the other components of other noninterest income increased million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase during the nine months ended september is largely the result of a million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in jbb capital llc jbb resulting from our bank subsidiarys acquisition on march of the equity interests of jbb it did not previously own the increases we experienced in certain noninterest income items were offset by a significant decline in gains on mortgage loans sold net which decreased by million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in the prior year as increases in the rate environment and declines in housing inventory in our markets negatively impacted both refinancing and new purchase originations noninterest expense increased by million or and million or respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the three and nine months ended september impacting noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same prior year periods were increases of million and million respectively in salaries and employee benefits the change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to fulltime equivalent associates at september versus at september as well as annual merit increases effective in january also contributing to the increase were equity compensation expenses which were up million and million respectively in the three and nine months ended september compared to the same prior year periods noninterest expense categories other than salaries and employee benefits were million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively during three and nine months ended september our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to and respectively for the three and nine months ended september the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue during the three and nine months ended september we recorded income tax expense of million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september our effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended september was compared to and respectively for the three and nine months ended september our tax rate in each period was impacted by among other things the vesting and exercise of equitybased awards previously granted under our equitybased compensation program for the three months ended september no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized for the nine months ended september we recognized excess tax benefits of million comparatively for the three and nine months ended september we recognized excess tax benefits of and million respectively financial condition loans increased billion or during the nine months ended september when compared to december the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets including the markets in which we recently expanded increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company offset in part by the million decrease in the amount of ppp loans in our portfolio during the nine months ended september as these loans were paid down or forgiven by the sba loan growth was also positively impacted during the nine months ended september by the addition of certain specialty lending groups including franchise lending and equipment lease financing total deposits were billion at september compared to billion at december an increase of billion or interestbearing core deposit growth during the nine months ended september increased approximately billion or from december as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these core deposits at september our allowance for credit losses was million compared to million at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment capital and liquidity at september and december our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q for

margin for the three and nine months ended september reflects the rising shortterm interest rate environment including the impact of exceeding substantially all of our loan floors during the second

positive impact from purchase accounting as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets during the three and nine months ended september our earning asset yield increased by basis points and basis points respectively from the same periods in the prior year conversely our total funding rates led by increases in interestbearing deposits rates increased by basis points and basis points respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the prior year in september the federal reserve again raised shortterm interest rates by basis points and our current expectation is another basis point increase during the remainder of given that substantially all of the loan floors on our adjustable rate loans were exceeded in the second and third quarters of these subsequent rate increases should contribute to expansion in our net interest margin during the remainder of when compared to comparable periods in we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations the additional onbalance sheet liquidity that we accumulated primarily due to government stimulus efforts during the covid19 pandemic has largely runoff as of september as a result we do not anticipate excess liquidity negatively impacting our net interest margin going forward as much as it did in and through the first half of our most likely forecast has shortterm interest rates moving higher during the last quarter of however there is much uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets due to the currently high level of inflation present in the economy the pace of the rate tightening cycle being led by the federal reserve open market committee and what risks these present for a recession to occur in the nearterm to help hedge against a potential pivot to a monetary easing cycle and the associated reduction in shortterm interest rates management entered into several interest rate floor and interest rate collar balance sheet hedging transactions in october these are designed to reduce downside risk to the net interest margin should shortterm interest rates fall while minimally impacting the net interest margin should shortterm interest rates rise these hedging strategies are reflected in our netinterestincome at risk modeling results as of september provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses our provision for credit losses was million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio recent historical and projected future economic conditions our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net chargeoffs the increase in provision expense as compared to the same periods in is primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and the developing uncertain economic environment also contributing to the provision expense for the three and nine months ended september were net chargeoffs totaling million and million respectively compared to million and million for the same periods in noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends while fees from our wealth management departments gains on mortgage loans sold gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions or our assetliability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period the following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended september and in thousands three months ended september nine months ended

from other equity investments other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in the three months ended september compared to the three months ended september relates to the previously disclosed changes to our firms insufficient funds and overdraft programs during the third quarter of the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the nine months ended september as compared to the nine months ended september is the result of increased transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the increased economic activity in our markets we continue to expect future service charge revenues to be negatively impacted by the changes to our insufficient funds programs as was reflected in our third quarter balances income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income and has fluctuated during the nine months ended september due in large part to market volatility for the three and nine months ended september commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank and fees from our wealth advisory group pnfp capital markets inc increased by million and million respectively when compared to the three and nine months ended september at september and pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion and billion respectively in brokerage assets the increases in these fees for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the three and nine months ended september were the result of among other things an increase in investment and transaction advisory fees from pnfp capital markets inc which increased million during the nine months ended september when compared to the nine months ended september revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended september increased by and million respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year included in insurance revenues for the nine months ended september was million of contingent income that was based on sales production and claims experience compared to recorded in the same period in the prior year additionally at both september and our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion of managed assets we believe the improvement in the results of our wealth management businesses during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the comparable periods in is primarily attributable to an increased number of wealth management advisors and corresponding client acquisition gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the prior year this decrease is the direct result of the increases in the rate environment negatively impacting both refinancing and new purchase originations we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline the hedge is not designated as a hedge for gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement the change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at september the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at september expected to close in investment gains and losses on sales net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our availableforsale securities portfolio during the periods noted during the three and nine months ended september million and million respectively of securities were sold for a net gain of and 156000respectively as compared to the three months ended september when we sold no securities and the nine months ended september when we sold million of securities for a net gain of income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg prior to september we held a portion of this investment at pinnacle financial and a portion at pinnacle bank effective september pinnacle financial contributed of the equity interests of bhg owned by it to pinnacle bank bhg is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors income from this equitymethod investment was million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the same periods last year historically bhg has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option in recent years bhg began an effort to retain more loans on its balance sheet bhgs decision to sell loans through its auction platform or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors including interest rates in a rising rate environment it may choose to sell more loans through its auction platform if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale through its auction platform since bhg has completed six securitizations totaling billion with the latest securitization of million having been completed in the third quarter of income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of and respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to and respectively for the three and nine months ended september at september there wer e million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of bhgs liabilities of and respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september at september there were of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next four years during the three and nine months ended september pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank received dividends of million and million respectively from bhg in the aggregate compared to million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september dividends from bhg during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated our proportionate share of earnings from bhg is included in our consolidated tax return during the three and nine months ended september pinnacle bank purchased loans from bhg of million and million respectively compared to loan purchases of million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september these loans were purchased at par pursuant to bhgs joint venture loan program whereby bhg and pinnacle bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase the yield on this portfolio to pinnacle bank is anticipated to be between and per annum at september and december there were million and million respectively of bhg joint venture program loans held by pinnacle bank for the three and nine months ended september bhg reported million and million respectively in revenues net of substitution losses of million and million respectively compared to revenues of million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september net of substitution losses of million and million respectively earnings from bhg are likely to fluctuate from periodtoperiod approximately million and million respectively of bhgs revenues for the three and nine months ended september related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september these loans have typically been sold by bhg with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan although the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model at september and there were billion and billion respectively of these loans previously sold by bhg that were being actively serviced by bhgs network of bank purchasers bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments as a result bhg maintained a liability as of september and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or loan prepayment this liability represents and respectively of core product loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of september and respectively the decrease in this liability as a percentage of core product loans during the nine months ended september compared to the comparable period ended september was principally the result of a partial release of the reserve bhg recorded in related to the economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner in and into in addition to these loans that bhg sells into its auction market at september bhg reported loans that remained on bhgs balance sheet totaling billion compared to billion as of september a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at september and bhg had billion and billion respectively of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment at september and bhg reported allowance for loan losses totaling million and million respectively with respect to the loans on its balance sheet we anticipate that bhg will increase the level of allowance for loan losses for the remainder of given the current macroeconomic environment bhg records its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method but will be required to adopt cecl effective october interest income and fees associated with these onbalance sheet loans amounted to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased and respectively during the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in due to increased commercial credit card volumes periodoverperiod as compared to other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance which was million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively in the same periods in the prior year the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable during the first nine months of we purchased an additional million of bank owned life insurance sba loan sales are included in other noninterest income and decreased by million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to the changing market conditions during the nine months ended september as compared to the nine months ended september as sba loan sales generally fluctuate based on general market conditions additionally the carrying values of other equity investments we have made are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investments income related to these investments decreased million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the prior year as we experienced greater increases in certain of our venture fund investment valuations due to changes in the valuations in their underlying portfolios during the three and nine months ended september than was the case in the three and nine months ended september loan swap fees decreased by and increased by million respectively during the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environments the other components of other noninterest income increased million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase during the nine months ended september is largely the result of a million gain on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in jbb resulting from our bank subsidiarys acquisition on march of the equity interests of jbb it did not previously own noninterest expense noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy expenses other real estate expenses and other operating expenses the following is a summary of our noninterest

marketing and other business development postage and supplies amortization of intangibles other noninterest expense deposit related expense lending related expense wealth management related expense other noninterest expense total other noninterest expense total noninterest expense total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in versus as well as annual merit increases effective in january our associate base increased to fulltime equivalent associates at september from at september we expect salary and benefit expenses in the fourth quarter of to increase when compared to the comparable period in as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions all of our banks noncommissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and all of our banks associates participate in our equity compensation plans under the annual cash incentive plan the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of quarterly pretax preprovision net revenue ppnr and annual earnings per common share subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and ppnr and earnings per common share are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of our targeted incentives for maximum payouts under the plan could reach of target compared to of target for through both the third quarter of and we accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan at maximum payout of our targeted awards of and respectively also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three and nine months ended september were approximately million and million respectively of compensation expenses related to equitybased awards for restricted shares restricted stock units and performance stock unit awards compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september under our equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for all of our banks associates we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization our compensation expense associated with equity awards with timebased vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of when compared to as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors compensation expense associated with our performancebased vesting awards will continue to be impacted by our performance in and will likely be higher than the comparable prior year period during the remainder of as the amount of performancebased vesting awards granted in was greater than those granted in the prior year through the three and nine months ended september we have accrued for that portion of our performance awards with performance tied to at abovetarget payout employee benefits and other expenses were million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september and include costs associated with our plan health insurance and payroll taxes these costs fluctuate based on changes in our associate base and the level of participation in these programs by our associates costs associated with our health insurance and plan programs increased million and million respectively in the aggregate during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in these increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods and in the case of our health insurance costs increases in the premiums we paid for this coverage in compared to premium levels equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended september were million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september the increases are in part the result of the three new office locations that we opened after september one in georgia one in west tennessee and the other in the southern part of north carolina we expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance and expand our current locations including in our new markets and further develop our technology infrastructure additionally during we announced our intention to move our corporate headquarters to an office tower under construction in nashville where we will be a founding partner and sponsor of the project this move is currently planned for and will impact equipment and occupancy costs as we plan for this move other real estate income and expenses net for the three and nine months ended september was a benefit of and expense of respectively as compared to benefits of and respectively for the same periods in the prior year marketing and business development expense for the three and nine months ended september was million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september the primary source of the increase for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in is the result of increased associate engagement as we brought back inperson orientation and associate meetings beginning in the first quarter of and increased client engagement as pandemicrelated restrictions lapsed we expect these costs to rise modestly and return to more normalized levels during the remainder of and into taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired since december intangible amortization expense was million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets their initial valuation and amortizable lives at september year acquired initial valuation in millions amortizable life in years remaining value in millions core deposit intangible avenue bnc book of business intangible miller loughry beach insurance capitalmark bnc insurance bnc trust advocate capital jbb capital these assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets annual amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from million to million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period other noninterest expenses which consists primarily of deposit lending wealth management and administrative expenses increased by million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the three and nine months ended september lending related expense increased by million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the prior year this increase is primarily the result of increased expense associated with our consumer and commercial credit card programs for which transaction volumes also increased in the respective period deposit related expense increased by and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in wealth management related expenses increased and respectively during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in due primarily to an increased number of accounts being serviced by these areas other noninterest expenses increased million and million respectively during the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in due in part to increases in consultant fees contributions and other miscellaneous expense items our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and respectively for the three and nine months ended september compared to and respectively for the three and nine months ended september the efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in was negatively impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the periods as a result of increased salaries and employee benefits and a decrease in the amount of gains on mortgage loans sold offset in part by increased income from our equity method investment in bhg and the impact of a rising interest rate environment income taxes during the three and nine months ended september we recorded income tax expense of million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and nine months ended september our effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended september was compared and respectively for the three and nine months ended september our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of primarily due to our investments in bankqualified municipal securities tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary participation in tennessees community investment tax credit citc program tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation bankowned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense nondeductible fdic insurance premiums and nondeductible executive compensation our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equitybased awards previously granted under our equitybased compensation program for the three months ended september no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized for the nine months ended september we recognized excess tax benefits of million comparatively for the three and nine months ended september we recognized excess tax benefits of and million respectively financial condition our consolidated balance sheet at september reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to billion compared to billion at december total deposits increased by billion to billion between december and september total assets were billion at september compared to billion at december loans the composition of loans at september and at december and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows in thousands september december amount percent amount percent commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans at september our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at december with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio at september approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties compared to at december owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate additionally the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local communities in which we operate and is diversified between commercial residential and land banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than of total riskbased capital should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at september pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital was compared to at december construction and land development nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and as of september and december respectively at september pinnacle bank was within the and guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the and thresholds the following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at september according to contractual maturities of one year or less after one but within five years after five but within fifteen years and after fifteen years the table also presents the portion of loans by loan segment that have fixed interest rates

problem loans potential problem loans which are not included in nonperforming assets amounted to approximately million or of total loans at september compared to million or of total loans at december potential problem loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse but not considered nonperforming loans none of the potential problem loans were past due at least days but less than days as of september nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at september we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at september and million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at december at september and december there were million and million respectively of troubled debt restructurings all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status allowance for credit losses on loans acl on january we adopted fasb asu which introduced the current expected credit losses cecl methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio accordingly the acl represents an amount that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of september and december our acl was approximately million and million respectively which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates our acl as a percentage of total loans inclusive of ppp loans was at september down from at december no acl has been recorded for ppp loans as they are fully guaranteed by the sba our cecl models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate gross domestic product the commercial real estate price index and certain us treasury interest rates projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages at september a reasonable and supportable period of twentyfour months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages the following table sets forth based on managements estimate the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans and loan balances by category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of september and december in thousands september december acl

resulting balance the level of the acl is based upon managements evaluation of historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the acl is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the acl to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at september while our policies and procedures used to estimate the acl as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate markets or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our acl and thus the resulting provision for credit losses investments our investment securities portfolio consisting primarily of federal agency bonds mortgagebacked securities and state and municipal securities amounted to billion at september compared to billion at december our

derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q securities purchased with agreement to resell at september and december we had million and billion respectively in securities purchased with agreement to resell this balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties during these investments allowed us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment during we have opted to exit certain of these transactions to both fund our loan growth as well as repay certain fhlb advances to best support our firm in the current rising rate environment deposits and other borrowings we had approximately billion of deposits at september compared to billion at december our deposits consist of noninterest and interestbearing demand accounts savings accounts money market accounts and time deposits additionally we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day these agreements which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns for their excess funds amounted to million at september and million at

remained well above internal policies we remain optimistic that we will be able to grow our levels of core funding as needed during the remainder of and into to fund our balance sheet in a sound manner we created and implemented several deposit gathering initiatives in as part of our annual strategic planning process in anticipation of the more challenging deposit gathering environment we are seeing develop in the fourth quarter of and into as m2 money supply levels are projected to decline when wholesale funding is necessary to complement the companys core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives our asset liability management policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those

same day our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately million or per share or per depositary share on the series b preferred stock payable on december to shareholders of record at the close of business on november the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including if necessary our receipt of dividends from pinnacle bank regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiarys financial results market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled there were several noteworthy factors when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of september to the modeling results as of september the federal reserve increased the federal funds target rate by basis points since december which brought nearly all floatingrate loans above contractual interestrate floors the fixedrate ppp loan portfolio declined million with most proceeds transitioning to floatingrate assets short term floatingrate assets comprised of interestbearing cash and repurchase agreements decreased billion in october interest rate floor and collar derivatives with a notional value of billion were added to the balance sheet to mitigate earningsatrisk in a falling interest rate scenario the impact of these derivatives is included in each of the earnings simulation and economic equity models below earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated estimated change in net interest income over months september september instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at september our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at september our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates september september instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound funds libor etc are assumed to be zed while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at september our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario assumes an additional basis point increase in the federal funds rate during our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at september we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue this policy if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis as noted previously pinnacle bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati and pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the fhlb cincinnati has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firms alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the fhlb cincinnati at september we believe we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at september or during the three months then ended although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically pinnacle bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at september at september excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the intrafinetwork we had approximately billion in brokered deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid during and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we intentionally increased our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity core deposit growth during increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of onbalance sheet liquidity we intend to continue to prepay andor let mature wholesale funding as core deposit levels allow banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at september we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint including the markets to which we have recently expanded and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm our shortterm borrowings borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns on their excess funds we have certain contractual obligations as of september which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to september each of these commitments is noted throughout item managements discussion and analysis our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments including loan commitments and reasonable borrower depositor and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longerterm as well offbalance sheet arrangements at september we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of billion because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements if needed to fund these outstanding commitments pinnacle bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities availableforsale or on a shortterm basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions we follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for onbalance sheet instruments each customers creditworthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis and the amount of collateral obtained if any is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer however should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us our maximum exposure to credit loss without consideration of collateral is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments at september we had accrued reserves of million related to expected credit losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments recently adopted accounting pronouncements see part i item consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies of this report for further information
