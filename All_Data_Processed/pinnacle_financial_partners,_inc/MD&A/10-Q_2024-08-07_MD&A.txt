for the three and six months ended june and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december form 10k and the other reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission since we filed that form 10k unless the context otherwise requires the terms pinnacle financial we our or similar terms refer to pinnacle financial partners inc and where appropriate its subsidiaries overview general our diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended june was and respectively compared to and respectively for the same periods in at june loans increased to billion as compared to billion at december and total deposits increased to billion at june from billion at december results of operations our net interest income increased to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the prior year representing an increase of million or and million or respectively for the three and six months ended june when compared to the comparable periods in this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio partially offsetting these increases in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior years comparable periods the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for the three and six months ended june was and respectively compared to and respectively for the same periods in and reflects increased average earning asset balances and the intentional focus of our relationship managers on obtaining appropriate pricing on new and renewing loans and keeping our deposit pricing well contained as well as the stability of our noninterest bearing deposit balances during the quarter our provision for credit losses was million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the change in provision expense for the three and six month periods ended june as compared to the same periods in is primarily the result of reserves associated with a million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of as well as the overall increase in loan loss reserves due to the potential implications of a higherforlonger interest rate environment that we were anticipating at the end of the first and second quarters of also impacting provision expense for the three and six months ended june were net chargeoffs totaling million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in negatively impacting net chargeoffs in the second quarter of was the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owneroccupied commercial real estate loan which resulted in a chargeoff of million noninterest income decreased by million or and million or respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in for the three and six months ended june the decrease is due primarily to the intentional repositioning of our securities portfolio with the goal of meaningfully enhancing its future performance with the sale of approximately million of availableforsale securities at a net loss of million the decrease was offset in part for the six months ended june as compared to the six months ended june by the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset associated with our freddie mac small business lending sbl platform of approximately million during the first quarter of which has been reflected in other noninterest income also contributing to noninterest income were wealth management revenues of million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively in the same periods in the prior year these increases in noninterest income were offset in part by a decline in income from our equity method investment in bhg of million or and million or respectively during the three and six months ended june from the same periods in the prior year also significantly contributing to the decline in noninterest income for both the three and six months ended june were gains on the sale of fixed assets of million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to and for the three and six months ended june respectively primarily the result of the saleleaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of noninterest expense increased by million or and or respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to the three and six months ended june impacting noninterest expense for the three and six months ended june as compared to the same prior year periods was an increase of million and million respectively in salaries and employee benefits the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to fulltime equivalent associates at june versus at june as well as annual merit increases effective in january and increases in cash and equity incentives due to our belief at june that we were likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in that would be higher than what we paid out under our annual cash incentive plan and under our performancebased vesting restricted stock unit awards based on estimated performance through the first half of noninterest expense categories other than salaries and employee benefits were million and million respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively during three and six months ended june increases of and respectively this increase is primarily due to approximately million in fees paid during the second quarter of to terminate an agreement to resell million of securities we had previously purchased additionally impacting noninterest expense was a million increase in the fdic special assessment which was originally estimated in the fourth quarter of and increased in the first quarter of as well as increased equipment and occupancy costs equipment and occupancy costs were million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june and were negatively impacted by higher levels of lease expense as a result of the execution of the saleleaseback transaction during the second quarter of along with the overall growth in our infrastructure additional locations added and new technology implemented in the last twelve months our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to and respectively for the three and six months ended june the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue our efficiency ratio declined during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in and was both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to net interest income noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above during the three and six months ended june we recorded income tax expense of million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended june was and respectively compared to for both the three and six months ended june our tax rate in each period was impacted by among other things the vesting and exercise of equitybased awards previously granted under our equitybased compensation program for the three and six months ended june we recognized excess tax benefits of and million respectively in connection with the vesting and exercise of such equitybased awards compared to tax expense of and excess tax benefits of for the three and six months ended june the increase in excess tax benefits recognized during the six months ended june as compared to the same period in was the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods financial condition loans increased billion or during the six months ended june when compared to december the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in the markets in which weve recently entered or expanded our presence increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company loan growth was also positively impacted during the six months ended june by the continued growth of certain specialty lending groups including franchise lending and equipment lease financing during we made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our underwriting particularly in construction and cre investment property we expect that to continue during the remainder of and our loan growth rates over such period should reflect this tightening total deposits were billion at june compared to billion at december an increase of billion or interestbearing deposits grew during the six months ended june by approximately billion or from december as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these deposits at june our allowance for credit losses was million compared to million at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses during the first six months of was primarily the result of reserves associated with a million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of and the overall increase in loan loss reserves due to the potential implications of a higherforlonger interest rate environment that we were anticipating at the end of the first and second quarters of additionally during the three and six months ended june net chargeoffs were million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in net chargeoffs increased in the second quarter of primarily due to the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owneroccupied commercial real estate loan which resulted in a chargeoff of million capital and liquidity at june and december our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10q form

cash that could be used to support our bank we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the previously authorized share repurchase program that expired on march the new authorization is to remain in effect through march we did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program

interestearning assets for the period for the three and six months ended june our net interest margin was and respectively compared to and respectively for the same periods in the compression in our net interest margin reflects the rise in cost of funds due to the elevated shortterm interest rate environment the competitive rate environments for deposits in our markets and increased reliance on brokered deposits and other sources of wholesale funding the inversion of the yield curve where short term interest rates rise above intermediate and longterm rates has resulted in asset yields increasing at a slower pace than the cost of funds during the three and six months ended june our earning asset yield increased by basis points and basis points respectively from the same periods in the prior year conversely our total funding rates led by increases in interestbearing deposits rates increased by basis points and basis points respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in the prior year we seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits but subject to internal policy limits on the amount of wholesale funding we may maintain will utilize wholesale funding to fund shortfalls if any or provide additional liquidity to the extent that our dependence on wholesale funding sources increases as was the case during the year ended december our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits should rates begin to decline we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations during the federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates by basis points our most likely forecast for shortterm rates through at the time of our most recent alco meeting was mostly consistent with the federal funds futures markets expectations for rate movements at that time but there is uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets thus far in the federal reserve has left shortterm interest rates unchanged provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses our provision for credit losses was million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in the provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio recent historical and projected future economic conditions our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net chargeoffs the change in provision expense for the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in is primarily the result of reserves associated with a million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of and the overall increase in loan loss reserves due to the potential implications of a higherforlonger interest rate environment that we were anticipating at the end of the first and second quarters of also contributing to provision expense for the three and six months ended june were net chargeoffs totaling million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the same periods in negatively impacting net chargeoffs in the second quarter of was the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owneroccupied commercial real estate loan which resulted in a chargeoff of million noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth while investment services fees from the origination of mortgage loans swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect financial market conditions or our assetliability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period the following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and six months ended june and in thousands three months ended june six months ended june increase decrease increase decrease noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts investment services insurance sales commissions gains on mortgage loans sold net investment losses on sales of securities net trust fees income from equity method investment gain on sale of fixed assets other noninterest income interchange and other consumer fees bankowned life insurance loan swap fees sba loan sales other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income our fee categories of wealth management and service charges on deposit accounts including interchange and other consumer fees reflect strong revenue growth the increase in service charges on deposit accounts of million or and million or respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to the three and six months ended june is the result of increased transaction volumes which we believe is the result of the increased economic activity in our markets in each of the periods presented income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income and was impacted in part during the three and six months ended june by market volatility for the three and six months ended june commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank and fees from our wealth advisory group pnfp capital markets inc increased by approximately million and million respectively when compared to the three and six months ended june at june and pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion and billion respectively in brokerage assets revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and six months ended june increased by and decreased by respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year included in insurance revenues for the six months ended june was of contingent income that was recorded in the period but based on sales production and claims experience compared to million recorded in the same period in the prior year that was based on sales production and claims experience additionally at june our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion of managed assets compared to billion at june we believe the improvement of million or and million or respectively in income from the investment and trust segments of our wealth management business during the three and six months ended june when compared to the three and six months ended june is primarily the result of an increase in the number of wealth management advisors a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising or higher interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million and million for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million for the same periods in the prior year similar to wealth management the increase in mortgage fee income was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of mortgage bankers a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline the hedge is not designated as a hedge for us gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement the change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at june the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at june expected to close in during the three months ended june and june million and million respectively of investment securities were sold in our availableforsale securities portfolio net losses on the sale of these investment securities were million and million for the three months ended june and respectively in both periods these securities were sold in an effort to reposition our securities portfolio to enhance future earning potential we sold no investment securities in the first quarter of or the first quarter of for any securities classified as availableforsale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date we assess whether or not we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a writedown to fair value through net income because we currently do not intend to sell those availableforsale securities that have an unrealized loss at june and it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases which may be maturity we have determined that no writedown is necessary income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg bhg is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors income from this equitymethod investment was million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the same periods last year in bhg began retaining more loans on its balance sheet for much of its history bhg has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option bhgs decision to sell loans through its auction platform or recently directly to institutional investors or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors including interest rates as well as demand levels from the community bank network of buyers and institutional buyers to whom bhg markets these loans in a rising or elevated rate environment bhg may choose to sell more loans if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale either directly to asset managers or through its auction platform during and the first six months of bhg sold loans totaling approximately million and million respectively directly to asset managers since bhg has completed nine securitizations totaling billion with the latest securitization of approximately million having been completed in the first quarter of bhg also entered into funding facilities in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of including a facility with a us asset manager with outstanding balances of million and million at june and december respectively and an annualized interest rate at june of approximately these facilities which are secured by loans on bhgs balance sheet represent incremental funding sources to bhg we anticipate that bhg will complete additional securitizations in the future or otherwise establish other borrowing facilities to facilitate the retention of additional loans on bhgs balance sheet income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets associated with pinnacle banks investment in bhg of and respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to and respectively for the three and six months ended june at june there wer e million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of bhgs liabilities of and respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to and respectively for the three and six months ended june at june there were of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next three years during the three and six months ended june pinnacle bank received dividends of million and million respectively from bhg compared to million and million respectively received during the three and six months ended june dividends from bhg during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated our proportionate share of earnings from bhg is included in our consolidated tax return during the three and six months ended june and june pinnacle bank purchased no loans from bhg at june and december there were million and million respectively of bhg joint venture program loans held by pinnacle bank these loans were purchased at par from bhg by pinnacle bank and bhg and pinnacle bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase the yield on this portfolio to pinnacle bank is anticipated to be between and per annum during the three and six months ended june pinnacle bank sold million of bhg joint venture program loans back to bhg at par for the three and six months ended june bhg reported million and million respectively in revenues net of substitution and prepayment losses of million and million respectively compared to revenues of million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june net of substitution and prepayment losses of million and million respectively earnings from bhg are likely to fluctuate from periodtoperiod approximately million and million respectively or and respectively of bhgs revenues for the three and six months ended june related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to million and million respectively or and respectively for the three and six months ended june these loans have typically been sold by bhg with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan although the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model during the three and six months ended june bhg sold loans to its network of community banks and other financial institutions totaling million and billion respectively compared to billion and billion during the three and six months ended june respectively at june and there were billion and billion respectively of these loans previously sold by bhg that were being actively serviced by the purchasing banks bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments as a result bhg maintained a liability as of june and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment this liability represents of core product loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of both june and respectively the change in the dollar amount of this liability during the six months ended june compared to the comparable period ended june was principally the result of an increase in the amount of loans sold by bhg to financial institutions and bhg managements estimate of future substitution losses due to economic uncertainty in addition to these loans that bhg sells into its auction market or directly to institutional investors at june bhg reported loans that remained on bhgs balance sheet totaling billion compared to billion as of june the decrease in bhgs loans held on the balance sheet at june compared to june is primarily due to strong demand from purchasers in its community bank network of buyers which has led bhg to prioritize loan sales over retaining the loans a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at june and bhg had billion and billion respectively of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment at june and bhg reported an allowance for credit losses totaling million and million respectively with respect to the loans on its balance sheet the increase in allowance for credit losses for the six months ended june compared to the six months ended june was principally the result of the uncertain economic environment increased levels of losses on these loans and bhgs adoption of cecl on october prior to october bhg recorded its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method interest income and fees associated with these onbalance sheet loans amounted to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june gains on the sale of fixed assets were and respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june the gains on the sale of fixed assets for the three and six months ended june were primarily the result of the saleleaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased and respectively during the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in as a result of increases in debit and credit card usage other noninterest income also includes changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance boli which was million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively in the same periods in the prior year the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable during the fourth quarter of we restructured approximately million of boli contracts held by various insurance carries the increase in boli revenue during the six months ended june when compared to the comparable period in is a direct result of this restructuring and death benefit proceeds we received in the first six months of loan swap fees decreased and million respectively during the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in sba loan sales are included in other noninterest income and increased by and million respectively during the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in the prior year the change in both loan swap fees and sba loan sales are most directly impacted by the changing market conditions during the three and six months ended june as compared to the three and six months ended june the other components of other noninterest income increased million and million respectively during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase during the six months ended june is primarily the result of recognition during the first quarter of of an million mortgage servicing right associated with our freddie mac sbl platform the remainder of the change in the other components of other noninterest income include the impact of fair value adjustments from various other equity investments which can fluctuate on a quartertoquarter basis noninterest expense noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy expenses other real estate expenses and other operating expenses the following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and six months ended june and in thousands three months ended june six months ended june increase decrease increase decrease noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits salaries and commissions cash and equity incentives employee benefits and other total salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy other real estate expense net marketing and other business development postage and supplies amortization of intangibles other noninterest expense deposit related expense lending related expense wealth management related expense other noninterest expense total other noninterest expense total noninterest expense total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in the change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in versus as well as annual merit increases effective in january our associate base increased to fulltime equivalent associates at june from at june we expect total salary and benefit expenses for the year ended to increase when compared to the comparable period in as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions all of our banks noncommissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and all of our banks associates participate in our equity compensation plans under the annual cash incentive plan the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of annual earnings per common share and annual revenues subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and earnings per common share and revenues are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of our targeted incentives for our annual incentive plan provides for maximum payouts of up to of target cash incentive expense for the three and six months ended june totaled million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively during the same prior year periods due to our estimate at june that we are likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in that would be higher than what we paid out under our annual cash incentive plan in also included in cash and equity incentives for the three and six months ended june were approximately million and million respectively of compensation expenses related to equitybased restricted share awards compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june as well as approximately million and million respectively of compensation expenses related to equitybased restricted share units with either timebased or performancebased vesting criteria compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june under our equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for all of our banks associates a significant percentage of which is performancebased for our senior executive officers we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our plan health insurance payroll taxes and contract labor these expenses increased by and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to the same prior year periods these increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and six months ended june were million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june the increase is in large part due to the saleleaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of also impacting equipment and occupancy expense were costs associated with the opening of seven new locations across our footprint during the six months ended june compared to the opening of four new locations during the comparable period in the planned relocation of our corporate headquarters to a new location in early has also impacted equipment and occupancy expense during the three and six months ended june and we expect the costs associated with this relocation to increase as we approach our relocation date marketing and business development expense for the three and six months ended june was million and million respectively compared to million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june we continue to expect these costs to rise modestly in when compared to taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired in the last twelve months and expect to hire during the remainder of intangible amortization expense was million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june compared to million and million respectively for the

wealth management and administrative expenses increased by million and million respectively for the three and six months ended june when compared to the three and six months ended june the primary increase in other noninterest expense during the three and six months ended june when compared to the same prior year periods is the result of approximately million in fees paid during the second quarter of for the termination of an agreement to resell securities previously purchased additionally deposit related expense increased by million and million respectively during the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in due to increased fdic insurance assessments which were million and million respectively higher in the three and six months ended june than in the

effective tax rate for the three and six months ended june was and respectively compared to for both the three and six months ended june our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and

summarized as follows in thousands june december amount percent amount percent commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans at june our loan portfolio composition had changed slightly from the composition at december with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio at june approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties compared to at december owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate we are pursuing reduced levels of commercial real estate loans by significantly limiting growth in these loan segments until certain benchmarks are achieved lending concentrations we periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries we use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications we have a credit exposure loans

have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than of total riskbased capital should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at june pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were compared to at december construction and land development nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and as of june and december

at december potential problem loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse but not considered nonperforming loans none of the potential problem loans were past due at least days but less than days as of june nonperforming assets and modified loans at june we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at june and million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at december the change in nonaccrual loans at june as compared to december is largely the result of an increased number of consumer real estate loans being assigned to nonaccrual status at june there were million of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty of which million were accruing as of the modification date and remain on accrual status allowance for credit losses on loans acl the current expected credit losses cecl methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio accordingly the acl represents an amount that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of june and december our acl was approximately million and million respectively which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates our acl as a percentage of total loans was at june compared to at december the increase in the acl since december is primarily the result of reserves associated with a million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of and our view at the time of the recording of the reserves of the impact that a higherforlonger interest rate environment could have on our acl model our cecl models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses macroeconomic factors used in the model include the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate gdp commercial property price index consumer credit commercial real estate price index household debt ratio household financial obligations ratio and certain home price indices projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages at both june and december a reasonable and supportable period of fifteen months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages the following table sets forth based on managements estimate the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans loan balances by category the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan

allowance for credit losses on loans on a quarterly basis this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at june while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses investments our investment securities portfolio consisting primarily of us treasury securities federal agency bonds mortgagebacked securities and state and municipal securities amounted to billion and billion at june and december respectively our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income as collateral for public funds deposits and as a

presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings the effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of june and december was and respectively restricted cash our restricted cash balances totaled approximately million at june compared to million at december this restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio the decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q securities purchased with agreement to resell at june and december we had million and million respectively in securities purchased with agreement to resell this balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties during the second quarter of we terminated an agreement to resell million of securities purchased with an agreement to resell to reposition these funds into higher yielding assets in connection with terminating the agreement we paid approximately million in fees we initially secured these investments to allow us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment the remaining repurchase agreements are set to mature in deposits and other borrowings we had approximately billion of deposits at june compared to billion at december our deposits consist of noninterest and interestbearing demand accounts savings accounts money market accounts and time deposits at june and december we estimate that we had approximately billion and billion respectively in uninsured deposits which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit we estimate that we had approximately billion and billion respectively in our uninsured deposits at june and december respectively which were collateralized at those dates we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day these agreements which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns for their excess funds amounted to million at june and million at december additionally at both june and december pinnacle bank had borrowed billion in advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb the amount of fhlb advances at each date was impacted by our decision in the first half of to increase our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity in response to the current economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple highprofile banking institutions at june pinnacle bank had approximately billion in additional availability with the fhlb however incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb generally we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below the following table represents the balances of

intrafi network regulatory guidance defines reciprocating deposits in a portfolio of a bank of our size over and above billion as noncore funding however we have witnessed no distinction in the behavior of the deposits in our portfolio over and above billion versus the deposits up to billion therefore we have included the entire portfolio of reciprocating deposits in the table above as core funding as noted in the table above our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased moving from at december to at june and remained above internal policies we experienced a mix shift in deposits during as a result of the multiple highprofile bank failures in the first half of as certain of our depositors opted for additional insurance by way of the reciprocating deposit accounts we offer through the intrafi network and certain of our depositors moved their deposits out of noninterest bearing accounts and into interestbearing accounts to take advantage of increased rates during the first half of our noninterest bearing deposit accounts have stabilized additionally we continue to create and implement new and enhanced deposit gathering initiatives each year as part of our annual strategic planning process in recognition of the more challenging deposit gathering environment we are currently experiencing when wholesale funding is necessary to complement our core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives our asset liability management policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of june the amount of time deposits as of june amounted to billion the following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than and in denominations of

banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q for additional information regarding our capital ratios during the second quarter of we executed a credit default swap arrangement cds with a notional amount of million with a counterparty which equals percent of a reference pool of billion of first lien consumer real estate mortgage loans whereby the counterparty has assumed the firstloss position for these loans up to approximately million in aggregate losses we will pay to the counterparty an annual loss protection fee equal to of the corresponding notional amount of the cds for as long as the loans in the reference pool remain outstanding the notional amount of the cds will decline over time as the loans in the reference portfolio are paid down mature or the investor absorbs the first loss portion of any loan losses on those loans additionally and in accordance with regulatory guidelines during the second quarter of we implemented enhanced control processes with respect to certain commercial loans which permits recharacterization of these loans in order to reduce the risk weights assigned to these loans as a result the loans subject to the cds and the loans where risk ratings were able to be recharacterized now qualify for reduced risk weights pursuant to riskbased capital guidelines the benefits of these reductions in risk weighting offset the impact to regulatory capital of the million net loss on sale of approximately million of investment securities and the approximately million in fees related to the termination of the agreement to resell securities previously purchased recognized in conjunction with the repositioning of our securities portfolio in the second quarter of from time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank pinnacle bank at june we had approximately million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels share repurchase program on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock the authorization for this program remained in effect through march on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on march the new authorization is to remain in effect through

the commissioner of the tdfi pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our banks retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years which was billion at june additionally approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of pinnacle bank to fall below specified minimum levels during the six months ended june the bank paid dividends of million to us which is within the limits allowed by banking regulations during the three and six months ended june we paid million and million respectively in dividends to our common shareholders and million and million respectively in dividends on our series b preferred stock on july our board of directors declared a per

close of business on august additionally on that same day our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately million or per share or per depositary share on the series b preferred stock payable on september to shareholders of record at the close of business on august the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including if necessary our receipt of dividends from pinnacle bank regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiarys financial results market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated estimated change in net interest income over months june june instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the change in interest rate sensitivity between june and june set out in the table above is due to factors impacting both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet over the past year floatingrate shortterm liquidity decreased as a percent of interestearning assets while nonmaturity deposits indexed to the federal funds rate increased as a percent of interestbearing liabilities these two factors were the primary drivers behind reduced asset sensitivity and a more neutral interest rate position at june as compared to june at june our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at june our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates june june instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps increase bps decrease bps decrease bps decrease while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at june our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario assumes two basis point decreases in the federal funds rate during with the first decrease occurring in the third quarter of our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at june we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue this policy if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity our financial advisors attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis as noted previously pinnacle bank is a member of the fhlb and pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the fhlb has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb as a source of liquidity depending on the firms alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the fhlb to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the fhlb at june we believe we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at june or during the period then ended although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically pinnacle bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at june at june excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the intrafi network we had approximately billion in brokered deposits and billion in uninsured and uncollateralized deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid during and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the macroeconomic environment and the failure of multiple highprofile financial institutions we intentionally increased our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits increased borrowings from the fhlb holding the proceeds from the saleleaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of the sale of investment securities and increases in brokered time deposits we intend to continue to prepay andor let mature wholesale funding as core deposit levels allow banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at june we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures however we believe the relocation of our headquarters in early does as a whole constitute a significant commitment for capital expenditure we expect overall capital expenditures related to the relocation to approximate million inclusive of amounts we have already incurred substantially all of which we expect to incur through midyear as of june we had incurred million of capital expenditure for the relocation project additionally expansion of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint including the markets to which we have recently expanded and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense in addition to the above noted expenditures if we were to breach the terms of one of the leases entered into in the saleleaseback transaction and the counterparty terminated the lease in accordance with its terms we may be forced to expend significant amounts of capital expenditures to lease procure and build or renovate a suitable replacement office additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with planned technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm our shortterm borrowings borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns on their excess funds we have certain contractual obligations as of june which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to june each of these commitments is noted throughout item managements discussion and analysis our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments including loan commitments and reasonable borrower depositor and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longerterm as well offbalance sheet arrangements at june we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of billion because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements if needed to fund these outstanding commitments pinnacle bank has the ability to liquidate securities availableforsale or on a shortterm basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions we follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for onbalance sheet instruments each customers creditworthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis and the amount of collateral obtained if any is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer however should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us our maximum exposure to credit loss without consideration of collateral is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments at june we had accrued reserves of million related to expected credit losses associated with offbalance sheet commitments recently adopted accounting pronouncements see part i item consolidated financial statements note summary of significant
