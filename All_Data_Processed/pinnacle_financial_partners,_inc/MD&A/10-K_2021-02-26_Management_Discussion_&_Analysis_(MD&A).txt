item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition at december and and our results of operations for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein impact of covid19 pandemic on january the world health organization declared a global health emergency related to a novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 with that declaration we activated our pandemic response team and began work to prepare both our associates and clients for the impact of covid19 the spread of covid19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental commercial and consumer activity in the united states and globally including the markets that we serve these actions included the decision by the federal reserve open markets committee to lower the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to on march this action followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to a range of to on march we have been intentional in our response to the covid19 pandemic to ensure strength in our balance sheet including increases in liquidity and reserves as a part of this intentional response we conducted an extensive loan review and rerisk grading process in during the second quarter of we performed an indepth review of all riskgraded loans greater than million for which we had granted the borrower the ability to defer the payment of principal andor interest for a period of up to days following the covid19 outbreak we also performed an indepth review of all of our hotel and retail commercial real estate loans greater than million regardless of their receipt of deferral during the third quarter our focus broadened to include the other segments of the portfolio that are risk rated that we did not rerisk grade during the second quarter this extensive reunderwriting effort included our pass grade loans with exposures greater than million and watch list criticized or classified loans with exposures greater than during the fourth quarter we performed a followup in depth review of hotel loans million and greater all nonpass grade exposures greater than and a comprehensive review of loans with a low pass risk grade known to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic additionally throughout and in response to the pandemic we continued to adjust our business practices including restricting employee travel encouraging employees to work from home where possible continuing drivethru only service at certain of our locations with specific needs facilitated by appointment implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices and by the launch of our pandemic response team which continues to meet on a regular basis many of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into law it contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic the cares act included the paycheck protection program ppp a program designed to aid small and mediumsized businesses sole proprietors and other selfemployed persons through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks these loans were intended to guarantee eight to weeks of payroll and other costs to provide support to participating businesses and increase the ability of these businesses to retain workers as of december we had obtained approvals for approximately clients totaling approximately billion in approved loans these loans are fully guaranteed by the sba carry a term of two or five years dependent on the date originated and a annualized interest rate inclusive of fees from the sba our yield on ppp loans in was forgiveness of these loans by the sba began late in the third quarter as of december approximately applications amounting to million from pinnacle borrowers had been submitted to the sba for forgiveness and of those applications amounting to million had been approved for forgiveness with the remainder pending a response from the sba on december the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act coronavirus relief act was signed into law it contains significant additional relief programs including the authorization of a second round of ppp as of february under the second round of ppp we had received approximately applications amounting to approximately million with approximately applications approved and funded amounting to approximately million we believe that we will be just as effective in this round as the first round in assisting the small businesses in our markets that continue to be impacted by the pandemic though we expect to make fewer ppp loans given the smaller scale and reach of the second round as a result of the pandemic we also implemented a shortterm loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers this program allowed for a deferral of principal andor interest payments for days which may have been extended for an additional days for a maximum of days on a cumulative and successive basis for borrowers requiring a longerterm modification following the shortterm loan modification program we worked with eligible borrowers to modify such loans under section of the cares act the outstanding balance at december of loans which have received such modifications was approximately million we believe our response to the pandemic has allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates and clients and their communities the covid19 pandemic along with the implementation of cecl contributed to an increased provision for credit losses in and an extended duration of economic disruption resulting from the virus could lead to increased net chargeoffs and continued elevated levels of provisioning expense we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 the broad distribution administration efficacy and public acceptance of covid19 vaccines the effects of the cares act and coronavirus relief act and the prospects for additional fiscal stimulus programs closely however the extent to which each will impact our operations and financial results in remains uncertain particularly given the speed and unpredictable nature with which the pandemic is developing and evolving overview general our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended december was compared to fully diluted net income per common share of and for the years ended december and respectively at december loans had increased by billion as compared to december with a portion of this increase due to ppp loans results of operations our net interest income increased to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in as compared to was largely the result of lower cost of funds the impact of both interest and fees related to ppp our building of additional liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic and organic loan growth during the comparable periods the increase in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth net interest income in and was affected by a reduction in our net interest spread the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for was compared to and for and respectively our provision for credit losses was million for compared to million in and million in the primary drivers of the increase in provision expense during the year ended december when compared to the same period in were the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic and our adoption of fasb asu on january asu which introduces the current expected credit losses cecl methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio provision expense for the year ended december when compared to the comparable period in was primarily impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio and by our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included charge offs of certain loans contributing to provision expense in all periods were net chargeoffs which were million during compared to million in and million in the increase in net chargeoffs in was in large part the result of chargeoffs related to credits to borrowers whose businesses are in sectors which have been highly impacted by the covid19 pandemic at december our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans inclusive of ppp loans was compared to at december excluding ppp loans of billion our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans at december was the increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of cecl on january which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of million and increased provisioning during the year ended december due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the increase in the opening balance upon the implementation of cecl is partially attributable to a change in the treatment of acquired loans prior to the adoption of cecl acquired loans required an allowance only if estimated credit losses exceeded the remaining purchase accounting fair value discounts under cecl an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all loans without regard to fair value discounts also contributing to the increase in the opening balance upon adoption was an overall increase in reserve rates under cecl due to the estimation of all expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio rather than only probable incurred losses as was required under the prior accounting standard our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from at december to at december the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans between the years ended and is primarily attributable to provision expense related to organic loan growth noninterest income for compared to increased by million or noninterest income for compared to increased by million or the growth in noninterest income for compared to was in large part attributable to gains on mortgage loans sold net which increased by million for the year ended december as compared to primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment and housing markets in our markets in as well as our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods these gains on mortgage loans sold net were offset in part by a decrease in income from our equity method investment in bankers healthcare group llc bhg of million or during the year ended december compared to the same period in the prior year additionally positively impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of million for the year ended december compared to million for the same period in the prior year as well as in net gains on sales of securities during the year ended december compared to million in net losses on sales of securities during other noninterest income which is the result of fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above increased during the year ended december by million when compared to the same period in the prior year the increase in noninterest income from to was largely due to an increase in income from our investment in bhg which was million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december additionally increased transaction accounts and increased production in our feebased products such as investments insurance and trust each resulting primarily from organic growth contributed to increased noninterest income in compared to noninterest income was also impacted during the year ended december by million in net losses on the sale of investment securities compared to million in net losses on the sale of investment securities in as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in each period in preparation for anticipated changes in the yield curve during those periods noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or impacting noninterest expense for the year ended december as compared to was the million increase in salaries and employee benefits the change in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of and an increase in our associate base in versus offset in part by the reduction of our annual cash incentive plan accrual due to the adverse impact of covid19 and the adoption of cecl on diluted eps one of the performance metrics in our annual cash incentive plan during we also incurred reduced incentive expense associated with our performancebased equity awards we have previously awarded as the negative impact of covid19 and the adoption of cecl on our results negatively impacted our return on average tangible assets the performance metric applicable to these equity awards also impacting noninterest expense during the year ended december were million in lendingrelated costs related to an increase in our offbalance sheet reserves largely due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on expected credit losses under cecl million in fhlb restructuring charges and million in hedge termination charges noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or the majority of the increase was attributable to salaries and employee benefits expense which increased million primarily resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of as well as the increase in our associate base with our continued hiring of experienced bankers throughout our footprint during the period expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan were also higher in than in as we paid out incentives at of target as compared to targetlevel payouts in we also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs of million in versus this change was in part due to a million noncash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint additionally we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance our infrastructure during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our technology infrastructure during and we incurred no mergerrelated expenses compared to million during as we finalized the acquisition cultural and technological integration of bnc bancorp and its wholly owned bank subsidiary bank of north carolina together bnc the number of fulltime equivalent employees increased from at december to at december and at december during the three years ended december and we recorded income tax expense of million million and million respectively our tax expense for the year ended december was impacted by the adoption of cecl and the provision for credit losses recorded in response to the covid19 pandemic our effective tax rate for the years ended december and was and respectively our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and for the three years ended december and respectively the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue the efficiency ratio for the year ended december compared to the same period in and in as compared to were both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to noninterest expense net interest income and noninterest income discussed above net income for was million compared to million in net income in and million in net income for net income available to common shareholders for was million compared to million in and million in the presentation of net income available to common shareholders was required following the issuance of million depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of our fixed rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series b series b preferred stock in the second quarter of fullydiluted net income per common share was for compared to for and for net income in was primarily impacted by the increased provision expense incurred during fullydiluted net income per common share in was also impacted by the dividends paid on the series b preferred stock additionally positively impacting fullydiluted net income per common share in each of the years ended and were organic growth and the share repurchase programs effective during such periods financial condition our loan balances increased by billion or percent during as compared to and billion or percent as compared to contributing to increased loan volumes during were billion of loans as of december issued through the sbas ppp the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets that were made prior to the covid19 pandemic increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company the increase in our outstanding loan balances during was largely due to the continued economic growth in our core markets increases in the number of relationship managers primarily in our commercial lending program and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company total deposits increased from billion at december to billion at december an increase of billion or deposit growth during the period was likely aided by our clients need to build liquidity going into the covid19 pandemic and a shift by our clients to move funds into deposit accounts that they perceive as less risky during the pandemic but was also due in part to our increasing levels of onbalance sheet liquidity and intentional emphasis on gathering lowcost core deposits during within our deposits the ratio of core funding to total deposits increased from at december to at december we believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve as such we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing smalland middlemarket clients particularly if the economies in our principal markets continue to expand capital and liquidity at december and our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations from time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary at december we had approximately million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank net proceeds from the offering of our million depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of our series b preferred stock after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us were approximately million the net proceeds were retained at pinnacle financial and are available to support our capital needs and other obligations including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness to support the capital needs and other obligations of our bank and for other general corporate purposes additionally we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as the million subordinated debt offering issued during the third quarter of or entering into a new revolving credit facility with another financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels on november we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock and on october the board approved an additional million of repurchase authorization the initial repurchase program expired on march and the additional million authorization expired on december though it had been suspended since the end of the first quarter of due to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic between november and december we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million pursuant to these authorizations during the quarter ended march we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million our last purchase of shares of our common stock occurred on march on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock the authorization for this program will remain in effect through march critical accounting estimates the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with us generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry in connection with the application of those principles we have made judgments and estimates which in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses and the assessment of impairment of goodwill has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations allowance for credit losses loans as described below under recently adopted accounting pronouncements in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we adopted fasb asc effective january which requires the estimation of an allowance for credit losses in accordance with the cecl methodology our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay a loan including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the level of the allowance for credit losses maintained by management is believed adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is increased through provision for credit losses and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics we have identified the following pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for measuring expected credit losses owner occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans owner occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans are secured by commercial office buildings industrial buildings warehouses or retail buildings where the owner of the building occupies the property for such loans repayment is largely dependent upon the operation of the borrowers business nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans these loans represent investment real estate loans secured by office buildings industrial buildings warehouses retail buildings and multifamily residential housing repayment is primarily dependent on lease income generated from the underlying collateral consumer real estate mortgage loans consumer real estate mortgage consists primarily of loans secured by family residential properties including home equity lines of credit repayment is primarily dependent on the personal cash flow of the borrower construction and land development loans construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and eventual sale refinance or operation of the related real estate project construction and land development loans include family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses apartments office and retail space and land acquisition and development commercial and industrial loans commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial industrial andor other professional purposes these loans are generally secured by equipment inventory and accounts receivable of the borrower and repayment is primarily dependent on business cash flows loans granted under the ppp which are fully guaranteed by the sba are included in this category consumer and other loans consumer and other loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate mortgage classification examples of consumer and other loans are automobile loans consumer credit cards and loans to finance education among others many consumer loans are unsecured repayment is primarily dependent on the personal cash flow of the borrower for commercial real estate consumer real estate construction and land development and commercial and industrial loans we primarily utilize a probability of default pd and loss given default lgd modeling approach these models utilize historical correlations between default experience and certain macroeconomic factors as determined through a statistical regression analysis all loan segments modeled using this approach consider changes in the national unemployment rate in addition to the national unemployment rate gross domestic product and the three month treasury rate are considered for owner occupied commercial real estate the commercial real estate price index and the five year treasury rate are considered for construction loans and the three month treasury rate is considered for commercial and industrial loans projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default based on the statistical pd models adjustments are made to predicted default rates as considered necessary for each loan segment based on other quantitative and qualitative information not utilized as a direct input into the statistical models the resulting predicted quarterly default rates are then applied to the estimated future exposure at default ead as determined based on contractual amortization terms and estimated prepayments an estimated lgd determined based on historical loss experience is applied to the quarterly defaulted balances for each loan segment to estimate future losses of the loans amortized cost losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages the reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are reevaluated each quarter by management and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors upon implementation of cecl on january and at december a reasonable and supportable period of eighteen months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion to long term averages for the consumer and other loan segment a loss rate approach is utilized for these loans historical charge off rates are applied to projected future balances as determined in the same manner as ead for the statistically modeled loan segments for credit cards which have no amortization terms or contractual maturities and are unconditionally cancellable future balances are estimated based on expected payment volume applied to the current balance the estimated loan losses for all loan segments are adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses the qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management but measured by objective measurements period over period the data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources the current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time the resulting qualitative adjustments are applied to the relevant collectively evaluated loan portfolios these adjustments are based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations policy exceptions associate retention independent loan review results collateral considerations risk ratings competition and peer group credit quality trends the qualitative allowance allocation as determined by the processes noted above is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the collectively evaluated pools individual evaluations are generally performed for loans greater than million which have experienced significant credit deterioration such loans are evaluated for credit losses based on either discounted cash flows or the fair value of collateral when management determines that foreclosure is probable expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for loans for which foreclosure is not probable but for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral we have elected the practical expedient under asc to estimate expected credit losses based on the fair value of collateral with selling costs considered in the event sale of the collateral is expected loans for which terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr are evaluated using these same individual evaluation methods in the event the discounted cash flow method is used for a tdr the original interest rate is used to discount expected cash flows in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses we consider the results of our ongoing independent loan review process we undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio our loan review process includes the judgment of management independent internal loan reviewers and reviews that may have been conducted by thirdparty reviewers including regulatory examiners we incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance in accordance with cecl losses are estimated over the remaining contractual terms of loans adjusted for prepayments the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a tdr will be executed or such renewals extensions or modifications are included in the original loan agreement and are not unconditionally cancellable by us credit losses are estimated on the amortized cost basis of loans which includes the principal balance outstanding purchase discounts and premiums deferred loan fees and costs and accrued interest receivable accrued interest receivable is presented separately on the balance sheets and as allowed under asu is excluded from the tabular loan disclosures in note loans and allowance for credit losses in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k while policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to income are considered adequate by management and are reviewed periodically by regulators model validators and internal audit they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as changes in projected economic conditions real estate markets or particular industry conditions which may materially impact asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described in asc intangibles goodwill and other and amended by asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment adopted on january this standard provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity performs a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary or if a qualitative assessment is not performed the entity is required to perform a onestep test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any if based on a qualitative assessment an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount the onestep quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required we performed a qualitative assessment as of september our annual assessment date by examining changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors and other relevant entityspecific events including changes in the share price of our common stock the results of the qualitative assessment indicated that a onestep quantitative goodwill impairment test should be performed the results of the quantitative impairment test performed by an independent third party indicated that the estimated fair value of the sole reporting unit exceeded its carrying value amount at september and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded should our common stock experience a sustained price decline or other impairment indicators become known additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required should it be determined in a future period that goodwill has become impaired then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made while we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario significant fluctuations in our assetliability balances or the composition of our balance sheet a change in the overall valuation of the stock market specifically bank stocks performance of southeast us banks and our performance relative to peers changing these assumptions or any other key assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment if any results of operations the following is a summary of certain financial information as

recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of the increases in net interest income in as compared to were largely the result of lower funding costs due to a decline in shortterm interest rates the impact of both interest and fees from the ppp and our acquisition of additional onbalance sheet liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable period offset in part by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio the increases in net interest income in as compared to were attributable to organic growth in our loan portfolio and changes in the interest rates we receive on interest

acquisition of additional onbalance sheet liquidity as noted above the decline in shortterm interest rates declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets more specifically our net interest margin was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a declining macroeconomic interest rate environment which included a basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in march this decrease was offset somewhat by a decrease in funding costs during the year ended december our earning asset yield decreased by basis points and basis points from the years ended december and respectively while total funding rates decreased by basis points and basis points compared to the years ended december and respectively we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our margins we believe this challenging competitive environment will continue into even during a time of economic uncertainty due to covid19 we also expect the positive impact of purchase accounting on our net interest income will lessen in future periods which will negatively affect our net interest margin in we have sought to mitigate much of the negative impact that reductions in shortterm interest rates would have on our net interest margin through restructuring a portion of our investment securities portfolio purchasing loan interest rate floors and unwinding fixedtofloating loan interest rate swaps those tactics have benefited us during this recent period of falling shortterm interest rates however our net interest margin could be additionally impacted if we are not able to continue to lower deposit rates at a pace necessary to offset declines in our earning asset yields we determined in that holding elevated levels of onbalance sheet liquidity is a prudent response to the covid19 pandemic this strategy has and will continue to negatively impact the net interest margin until onbalance sheet liquidity returns to more normalized levels we seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits but will utilize noncore funding to fund shortfalls if any to the extent that our dependence on noncore funding sources increases during our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits rate and volume analysis net interest income increased by million between the years ended december

considered above as a change in volume provision for credit losses on january we adopted fasb asu which introduces the cecl methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan and heldtomaturity securities portfolios accordingly the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses the provision for credit losses amounted to million million and million for the years ended december and respectively provision expense is impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio our expectations about future economic conditions and net chargeoffs the primary driver of the increase in provision for credit losses for the year ended december was the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic our cecl model relies on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions including unemployment and gdp as key inputs to estimate future credit losses as a result the deterioration in economic conditions resulting from covid19 has resulted in a significant increase in expected credit losses also contributing to the increase in provision expense in the current year when compared to the and comparable periods was an increase in net chargeoffs which totaled million million and million respectively the increase in net chargeoffs in was in large part the result of chargeoffs related to loans to borrowers who operate businesses in sectors which have been highly impacted by the covid19 pandemic our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover all expected future losses as of the date the allowance is determined based on our allowance for credit losses assessment methodology at december our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans inclusive of ppp loans was up from at december excluding ppp loans of billion the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of cecl on january which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of million and increased provisioning expense during the year ended december as discussed above noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth while investment services fees from the origination of mortgage loans swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period the following is our noninterest income for the years ended december and in thousands table

life insurance loan swap fees sba loan sales gain on other equity investments other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income table end the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in compared to is primarily related to a reduction in analysis fees due to a decrease in the transaction volume of commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the covid19 pandemic the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in compared to is primarily related to increased analysis fees due to an increase in the volume and number of commercial checking accounts resulting from organic growth in this product income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income for the year ended december commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank were million compared to million at december and million at december reflecting increases in brokerage assets and yearoveryear volatility of the stock market at december pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion in brokerage assets compared to billion and billion at december and respectively insurance commissions were approximately million during compared to million during and additionally at december our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion and billion of managed and custodied assets respectively compared to approximately billion and billion at december and billion and billion at december the growth in our wealth management businesses is attributable to additional revenue producers added to our wealth management groups market volatility and the attractive markets in which we operate gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million million and million respectively for the years ended december and the increase in compared to and compared to is the direct result of the current interest rate environment which impacted volumes specifically with refinancing activity during the respective periods an increase in the number of revenue producers in our mortgage group and the strong housing markets in which we operate we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program the hedge is not designated as a hedge for gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement there is a positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge therefore the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at december the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at december expected to close in for the year ended december investment gains losses on sales net represent a net pretax gain we recognized upon the sale of million of investment securities compared to a million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in and an million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in and in preparation for anticipated changes in the yield curve during those periods income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg bhg is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors bhg has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys accountants and others income from this equitymethod investment was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively the decrease in compared to is the result of bhg recording increased allowance for loan losses for loans retained and recourse obligation reserves for loans sold through its network of bank purchasers in response to the covid19 pandemic the increased level of contribution we have experienced from bhg in and when compared to reflects the positive results bhg has experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model including its marketing efforts historically bhg has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option in the second half of bhg began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years as a result of the economic disruption resulting from the covid19 pandemic during bhg sold more loans through its auction platform than we had anticipated would be the case earlier in the year as is the case for our business the impact of the covid19 pandemic on bhgs business is not fully known at this point though we believe its business including demand for its loans and losses it may incur as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be negatively impacted in the third quarter of bhg completed its first securitization of approximately million in notes backed by commercial and consumer loans on its balance sheet to provide an additional funding source we anticipate that bhg will complete additional securitizations in the future income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively at december there were million of these intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair value of certain of bhgs liabilities of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively at december there were million of these liabilities that are expected to be accreted into income in lesser amounts over the next six years during the years ended december and respectively pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank received million million and million in dividends in the aggregate from bhg dividends from bhg during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated our proportionate share of earnings from bhg is included in our consolidated tax return during the year ended december pinnacle bank purchased million of loans from bhg at par pursuant to bhgs joint venture loan program whereby bhg and pinnacle share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase the yield on this portfolio to pinnacle bank is anticipated to be between and per annum pinnacle bank purchased no loans from bhg during the years ended december and respectively earnings from bhg are likely to fluctuate from periodtoperiod as our ownership interest in bhg is and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on bhgs board of managers we do not consolidate bhgs results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of bhgs activities at our percentage ownership in income from equitymethod investment in noninterest income for the year ended december bhg reported million in gross revenues net of substitution losses of million compared to million and million respectively for the years ended december and net of substitution losses of million and million respectively approximately million or of bhgs revenues for the year ended december related to gains on the sale of commercial loans bhg had previously issued primarily to doctor dentist and other medical practices compared to million or for the year ended december and million or for the year ended december bhg refers to this activity as its core product bhg typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet subsequent to origination these core product loans are sold by bhg with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model at december and there were billion and billion respectively in core product loans previously sold by bhg that were actively serviced by bhgs network of bank purchasers bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments this substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with bhg additionally all substitutions are subject to the approval by bhgs board of managers as a result the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on bhgs balance sheet at the net present value of the loans anticipated cash flows bhg will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status as a result bhg maintained a liability as of december and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution this liability represents and respectively of core product loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of december and respectively the increase in this liability for the year ended december was principally the result of the economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner particularly at the outset of the pandemic bhg will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser alternatively bhg may elect to keep certain loans on its balance sheet through maturity from time to time bhg may hold a higher volume of these loans depending upon the timing of loan originations its loan pipeline and market demand as well as the deployment of its business strategy as previously discussed bhg beginning in realigned its business model to retain more of its originated loans on its balance sheet in the second half of though it has slowed that transition due to covid19 at december bhg reported balance sheet loans totaling billion compared to million as of december a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at december and bhg had million and million of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting interest income and fees on loans held for investment amounted to million million and million for the years ended december and respectively bhg also sometimes refers loans to other financial institutions and based on an agreement with the institution earns a fee for doing so typically these are loans that bhg believes would either be classified as consumertype loans rather than commercial loans fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of bhg but another institution will accept the loans or are to borrowers in certain geographic locations where bhg has elected not to do business for the years ended december and bhg recognized fee income of million million and million respectively from these activities included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased during the year ended december as compared to the same period in due to increased debit and credit card transactions periodoverperiod likely due to increased remote commercial activity as a result of covid19 and increased loan fees primarily as a result of loan prepayments during other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance which was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively during and we purchased million million and million respectively of new bankowned life insurance policies the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable loan swap fees decreased by and increased by during the year ended december as compared to the same periods in and respectively due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the then current interest rate environment sba loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment and therefore increased in additionally the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers other other noninterest income fluctuated during the year ended december as compared to the same periods in and due in large part to million in policy benefits received during from our bankowned life insurance policies as well as the million loss on the sale of the highyield automobile portfolio in the second quarter of noninterest expense the following is our noninterest expense for the years ended december and in thousands table start years ended december percent increase decrease

deposit related expenses lending related expenses wealth management related expenses audit exam and insurance expense fhlb restructuring charges na administrative and other expenses total other noninterest expense total noninterest expense table end the increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in over and is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in over and and annual merit increases to base salaries offset in part by the reduction in expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan as well as the reduction in stockbased compensation expense due to our performance during compared to each due to the effects of covid19 on our anticipated earnings and performance for the year ended december at december our associate base had expanded to fulltime equivalent associates as compared to and at december and respectively primarily resulting from our efforts to continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates throughout our footprint we expect salary and benefit expenses will rise in compared to as we aim to return our focus to hiring experienced bankers in many of our markets including the atlanta market as well as due to our increased associate base and annual merit increases given in the first quarter of each fiscal year we also expect to continue to enhance the infrastructure around our operations to account for our increased size and geographic reach in which should also contribute to increased salary and benefit expenses commissions expense represents compensation paid to our wealth management lines of business including investment services trust insurance and capital markets commissions expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in the increase in as compared to and as compared to is primarily related to growth in our investment portfolio commissions as a result of increased activity in our wealth management lines of business and an increase in the number of wealth management associates commissions expense incurred related to the production of residential mortgages is recorded net of the related mortgage revenues we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions all of our banks noncommissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and all of our banks associates participate in our equity compensation plans under the annual cash incentive plan as originally designed for the targeted level of incentive payments required achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of and average rate paid on core deposits and earnings per share subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and core deposit volumes and rates and earnings per share are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of our targeted incentives in our cash incentives represented of targeted incentive compensation compared to in and in cash incentives for totaled million compared to million in and million in the decrease in when compared to is the result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our anticipated earnings for the year ended december as a result of our performance in the threshold for the plans eps target was not met which resulted in a reduction in incentives earned under the annual cash incentive plan in the third quarter of due to the effects of covid19 pandemic the human resources and compensation committee of our board of directors approved an additional performance metric under the annual cash incentive plan tied to our adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue for the year ending december ppnr payouts for all participants based on the ppnr metric were between and of their targeted payouts under the plan at target and maximum performance levels as a result of the addition of the ppnr performance metric participants in the plan were able to earn a cash incentive payout under the plan based on the larger of the original plan metrics and the new ppnr performance metric and the original deposit volume and rate goals under the plan the ppnr metric and the original deposit volume and rate goals were achieved at the maximum performance resulting in payouts of of the targeted payout however due to our results for and in consideration of the considerable effort our associates put forth during unusually difficult circumstances in the human resources and compensation committee approved an increase in the calculated award from percent of target to percent of target which amounted to million of additional expense in the fourth quarter of the increase in when compared to was primarily the result of the increase in the percentage of target of the payout from in to in as well as certain new associates that we had hired being able to participate in the annual cash incentive plan also included in cash and equity incentives for the years ended december and were approximately million million and million respectively of compensation expenses related to equitybased restricted share awards and approximately million million and million respectively of compensation expenses related to equitybased restricted share units with performancebased vesting criteria we have not issued stock options since under our equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for all of our banks associates we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the year ended december decreased when compared to the same period in primarily as a result of the fact that our performance in was below the threshold level of return on average tangible assets necessary for the recipients of those awards to earn that the portion of our performancebased awards with performance periods linked to as a result of the pandemic though our return on average tangible assets for was below that level necessary for any of the performance units granted with performance metrics tied to to be earned the human resources and compensation committee of our board of directors nonetheless approved the vesting of the target level of these awards for all of the recipients of these awards other than our named executive officers who forfeited their awards tied to the performance period in january the human resources and compensation committee of our board of directors approved modifications to the performance metrics applicable to the and performance periods of our performance units previously awarded these modifications replaced the return on average tangible assets performance metrics with two equally weighted metrics return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share accretion including the impact of common dividends performance awards granted in january also utilize these modified metrics as well as a relative total shareholder return payout modifier we expect that our compensation expense associated with performancebased equity awards for will likely exceed those levels that we recorded in our compensation expense associated with equity awards with timebased vesting criteria increased in when compared to and compared to as a result of the increased number of associates in each of these periods employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our plan health insurance payroll taxes and contract labor these expenses increased by million in compared to which increased by million when compared to the increase in as compared to and as compared to was primarily the result of the increase in fulltime equivalent associates in each respective period equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in included in the year ended december increase was a million noncash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint additionally we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our cybersecurity and operational and technology infrastructure we believe the number of our locations will increase over an extended period of time across our franchise and these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense other real estate expense for the year ended december was million compared to million in and in the increase in as compared to was the result of writedowns of million of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals obtained in the current year offset in part by a decline in property tax expenses associated with these properties the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of a million writedown in the second quarter of of facilities and land acquired in the bnc acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion marketing and business development expense for the year ended december was less than in which was greater than in the primary source of the decrease in as compared to is related to the decrease of inperson business meetings and client meals and entertainment during as a result of the restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic the primary source of the increases in as compared to is the associated marketing and business development expenses necessary to support the growth of our firm across our entire franchise in

amount percent commercial real estate owneroccupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans table end at december our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at december principally as a result of the ppp loans which are classified as commercial and industrial loans though commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continue to make up the largest segments of our portfolio at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owneroccupied commercial real estate properties compared to at december owneroccupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate additionally the construction and land development segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development in the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial residential and land the following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at december according to contractual maturities of one year or less after one year through five years and after five years the

does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments loan origination risk management we maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loans in our portfolio loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming loans diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable inventory or equipment some loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis commercial real estatemortgage loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property in the case of income producing property or the borrowers business if owneroccupied to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors if any commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy as detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly we believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow collateral geography and risk grade criteria we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates financial analysis of the developers and property owners and expectations of the permanent mortgage market among other items construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project which may be inaccurate construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property refinancing in the permanent mortgage market or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we also originate consumer loans including consumer realestate loans where we typically use a computerbased credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers seeks to minimize risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements we also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit and risk committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures lending concentrations we periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries we use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications we have a credit exposure loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments exceeding of pinnacle banks total riskbased capital to borrowers in the following industries at december and in thousands table start at december outstanding principal balances unfunded commitments total exposure total exposure at december lessors of nonresidential buildings lessors of residential buildings new housing forsale builders hotels and motels table end banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at december and pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and respectively nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans including construction and loan development loans were and for december and respectively pinnacle bank was within the and guidelines throughout and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the and thresholds though there may be periods where we exceed these levels if loan growth is more heavily weighted to these types of loans loans in past due status the following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least days but less than days and days or more past due as of december and  in thousands table start loans past due to days december december commercial real estate

potential problem loans potential problem loans amounted to approximately million or of total loans outstanding at december compared to million or of total loans outstanding at december potential problem loans which are not included in nonperforming loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse but not considered nonperforming loans approximately million of potential problem loans were past due at least but less than days as of december nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at december we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonperforming

december at december and there were million and million respectively of tdrs that were performing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact to its customers pinnacle bank implemented a shortterm modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by covid19 who were not more than days past due as of december this program allowed for a deferral of payments for days which pinnacle bank could extend for an additional days for a maximum of days on a cumulative and successive basis pursuant to the interagency regulatory guidance pinnacle financial may elect to not classify loans for which these deferrals were granted as tdrs in addition to the shortterm modification program implemented by pinnacle bank as discussed above section of the cares act and bank regulatory interagency guidance gave entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for tdrs indicating that a lender could conclude that the modifications are not a tdr if the borrower was less than days past due as of december we have followed the guidance under the cares act and the interagency guidance related to these loan modifications at december we had approximately million in loans modified under section of the cares act all nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan the special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses typically these special assets officers review our loan files interview prior officers assigned to the relationship meet with borrowers inspect collateral reappraise collateral andor consult with legal counsel the special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists which could include foreclosing on collateral restructuring the loan issuing demand letters or other actions we discontinue the accrual of interest income when there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or the principal or interest is more than days past due unless the loan is both wellsecured and in the process of collection during we recognized no interest income related to nonperforming loans in and respectively we recognized and of interest income from nonperforming loans reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief at the time of payment that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans allowance for credit losses on loans allowance on january we adopted fasb asu which introduces the cecl methodology and requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio accordingly beginning in the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of december and our allowance for credit losses and our allowance for loan losses was million and million respectively which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of

from our total loans of billion our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december the increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the implementation of asu on january which resulted in an adjustment to the opening balance of the allowance for credit losses of million and increased provisioning during the year ended december due primarily to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic our cecl models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate gross domestic product the commercial real estate price index and certain us treasury interest rates projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default these macroeconomic factors experienced significant deterioration during the first six months of resulting in a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses during the same period though these factors began to stabilize and in certain cases show improvement during the third and fourth quarters of should they deteriorate further in future periods including as a result of increased or sustained covid19 case volume or hospitalizations and governmental or community reactions thereto our modeling may require increased levels of provision expense over those recorded during under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages at december reasonable and supportable periods of eighteen months were utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages the overall balance of our allowance for loan losses at december was impacted by fair value accounting on our acquired loan portfolios for which an allowance for loan losses was only necessary under previous gaap if it exceeded the remaining fair value discount subsequent to the adoption of asu on january an allowance for credit losses is recognized for all acquired loans regardless of the amount of remaining fair value discounts in addition the remaining nonaccretable discount at december was reclassified into the allowance for credit losses upon adoption of asu on january at december the remaining fair value discount for all acquired portfolios was million all of which is expected to be accreted into income over the remaining contractual lives of the related loans for the years ended december and the net

accounting estimates in part i item critical accounting estimates herein based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at december while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses in particular the length and severity of the economic disruption of the covid19 pandemic remains difficult to predict and each may be worse than we have estimated which could cause our provision for credit losses to be negatively impacted for the duration of the pandemic and its aftermath we believe borrowers that operate in the restaurant entertainment hospitality and retail sectors including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels have been and continue to be the most likely to be negatively impacted by the economic disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic though other borrowers have been and are likely to continue to be negatively impacted as well if the strict social distancing practices or saferathome directives that were initially implemented in response to the spread of covid19 were to return or if additional governmental stimulus is not approved these impacts could be more severe than currently anticipated investments our investment portfolio consisting primarily of federal agency bonds state and municipal securities and mortgagebacked securities amounted to billion and billion at december and

customers in excess of our fdic coverage limit that we place with the promontory network as noted in the table above our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased from at december to at december primarily as a result of the significant increase in deposits estimated to have been funded in part by ppp loans and a shift by our clients to move funds into deposit accounts that they perceive as less risky during the pandemic offset in part by our intentional increase in wholesale funding to build onbalance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the impact of the covid19 pandemic competition for core deposits in our markets remains very competitive and we anticipate that our percentage of noncore funding is likely to increase as ppp loan funds are utilized when wholesale funding is necessary to complement our core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives our asset liability management policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of december our funding policies impose limits on the amount of noncore funding we can utilize based on the noncore funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines periodically we may exceed our policy limitations at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios at december and december we were in compliance with our core funding policies though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm and we experienced meaningful growth in core deposits in we may increase our noncore funding amounts from current levels if we need to do so to fund growth or increase levels of onbalance sheet liquidity but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed the limits we have established in our internal policies for total levels of noncore funding the amount of

capital position financial condition and other factors including new regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us if we fail to pay dividends on our series b preferred stock we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled during the year ended december several unique events occurred that are noteworthy when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of december to the modeling results at december in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points we built and carried approximately billion to billion in additional onbalancesheet liquidity we unwound a billion inthemoney interest rate floor we grew our portfolio of inthemoney client loan interest rate floors by approximately billion earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated table start estimated change in net interest income over months december december instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease table end negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at december our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at december our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates table start december december instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease table end negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at december our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario considers no change in shortterm interest rates throughout and our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10k we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at december we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue this policy if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis as noted previously pinnacle bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati and pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the fhlb cincinnati has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firms alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the fhlb cincinnati at december we believe we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at december or during the year then ended although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically pinnacle bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at december at december and excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the promontory network we had approximately billion and billion respectively in brokered deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid during and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we intentionally increased our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity during the first quarter of this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits increased borrowings from the fhlb cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits core deposit growth during the second third and fourth quarters of increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of onbalance sheet liquidity we intend to prepay andor let mature wholesale funding as core deposit growth allows banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at december we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm our shortterm borrowings borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns on their excess funds and fhlb cincinnati advances information concerning our shortterm borrowings as of and for each of the years in the threeyear period ended

prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation unlike most industrial companies virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institutions performance than the effects of general levels of inflation recently
