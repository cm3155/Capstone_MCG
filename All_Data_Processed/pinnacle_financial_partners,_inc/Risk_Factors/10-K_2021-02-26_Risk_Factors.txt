credit exposure to borrowers in certain industries and we also target small to mediumsized businesses our ability to grow our loan portfolio may be limited by among other things economic conditions competition within our market areas and our ability to hire and retain experienced bankers changes in accounting standards may change the way we calculate our allowance for credit losses if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan or securities portfolios our results of operations and financial condition will be negatively impacted our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers we may be subject to claims and litigation asserting lender liability liquidity and capital risks liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our

impairment of our goodwill our selection of accounting policies and methods may affect our reported financial results we currently invest in bank owned life insurance and may continue to do so in the future the fair values of our investments in private companies and venture capital funds are likely to fluctuate and the value that we ultimately realize on those investments may vary materially an ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks andor losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences we

business reputation and relationships are important and any damage to them could have a material adverse effect on our business we face substantial competition and are subject to certain regulatory constraints not applicable to some of our competitors which may decrease our growth or profits the implementation of other new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to

guaranteed by the fdic risks related to our business covid19 risks the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting our business and the businesses of a significant percentage of our customers as well as certain of our thirdparty vendors and service providers and the adverse impacts on our business financial position capital liquidity results of operations and prospects could be significant the spread of covid19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in uncertainty volatility and deterioration in financial markets and in governmental commercial and consumer activity including in the united states where we conduct substantially all of our activity covid19 has had an adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business financial condition and results of operations to combat the spread of covid19 federal state and local governments have taken a variety of actions that have materially and adversely affected the businesses and lives of our customers these actions have included orders closing nonessential businesses and restricting movement of individuals through the issuance of saferathome orders and other guidance encouraging individuals to observe strict social distancing measures at times the actions being taken by governmental authorities have not always been coordinated or consistent across states or even within states and the impact of those actions across our markets may be uneven these actions together with the independent actions of individuals and businesses aimed at slowing the spread of the virus have resulted in extensive economic disruption and rapid declines in certain consumer and commercial activity many businesses have experienced and are continuing to experience significant declines in revenue and there have been and continue to be elevated unemployment rates throughout our markets with corresponding negative effects on consumer spending and behavior whether the efforts to stop the spread of covid19 will be successful is unknown at this time as cases hospitalizations and deaths in some of our markets remain elevated and in recent weeks new variants or mutations of the virus have begun to emerge that in some cases are more contagious than the original virus and continued spread of the disease or continuation of higher levels of cases hospitalizations and deaths during will further negatively impact the businesses and lives of our customers and our results of operations in march the federal open market committee reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points and for a portion of march the 10year treasury bond rate fell to below for the first time in history these actions and other actions being taken by governmental and regulatory agencies affecting monetary policy in response to the unprecedented challenges resulting from the spread of covid19 have negatively impacted our net interest margin and our results and are likely to continue to negatively impact our net interest margin and our results in as a result of covid19 many of our borrowers particularly those that operate in the restaurant entertainment hospitality and retail sectors but also other businesses as well including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress which is expected to continue over the coming months as a result these borrowers may have difficulty paying on a timely basis interest and principal payments on their loans and the value of collateral securing these obligations may be adversely impacted as well though we have worked with borrowers to modify their loans under our shortterm deferral program and under section of the cares act these borrowers may still be experiencing distress as a result these borrowers may have difficulty satisfying their obligations to us disruptions to our customers businesses together with volatility in the stock market could also result in declines to our wealth management revenues the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic have resulted in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer and these changes are likely to persist until the pandemic subsides these economic pressures may be more severe and changes in behavior more pronounced if additional government stimulus programs are not timely approved or approved at all or if they do not provide sufficient relief when approved consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis and certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction we lend to customers operating in such industries including restaurants hotelslodging entertainment retail and commercial real estate among others that have been significantly impacted by covid19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely the changes in behaviors driven by covid19 particularly if those changes continue after the pandemic is over also present heightened liquidity risks for example arising from increased demand for our products and services such as elevated levels of draws on credit facilities or decreased demand for our products and services such as idiosyncratic or broadbased market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows like our borrowers bhgs borrowers have been similarly affected by covid19 many of bhgs borrowers are medical or dental practices that were particularly impacted by saferathome orders that effectively caused those practices revenues to decline materially as a result of elective procedures being prohibited cancelled or delayed or individuals decisions to postpone nonemergency procedures even as restrictions on elective procedures are relaxed though these borrowers businesses have improved recently increased levels of cases and renewed government mandated closures and restrictions could again negatively impact these borrowers businesses for those loans that bhg has sold through its auction platform bhg may at its sole discretion in response to a request from a purchaser of a loan agree to substitute a performing loan for one that has become past due more than days if requests for substitutions increase and bhg opts to provide the substitution bhgs credit losses may likewise increase and its results of operations would be adversely impacted covid19s economic disruption has also impacted many states and municipalities as a result many states and municipalities are facing a strain on resources and a reduction in tax collections and some of these have sought assistance from the federal government to cover the cost of resource depletion and tax shortfalls the ability of states and municipalities to fund shortfalls could have an adverse effect on their ability to sustain debt maintenance obligations which would negatively impact the value of our municipal bond portfolio if we hold bonds issued by those states or municipalities bank regulatory agencies have been and are expected to continue to be very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers especially borrowers as shown during and following the financial crisis periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations we are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards including changes resulting from changes in leadership of these regulatory agencies such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements furthermore provisions of the cares act allowed but did not require the fdic to guarantee deposit obligations of banks in noninterestbearing transaction accounts through december participation in any similar guarantee program authorized in subsequent legislation may result in fees and other assessments as the fdic determines and may include special assessments other provisions of the cares act as well as actions taken by bank regulators such as potential relief for working with borrowers who are distressed as a result of the effects of covid19 could similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense as we have sought to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers during the pandemic we have taken numerous actions to modify our business operations including restricting employee travel directing a significant percentage of our employees that were able to do so to work from home closing the lobbies of many of our branches and in some cases the branch itself and implementing our business continuity plans and protocols we may take further actions in the future either of our own volition or as a result of government orders or directives though we believe we have been able to adequately service our clients under these restrictions we cannot provide any assurances that our ability to do so wouldnt be negatively impacted if additional restrictions are necessary or imposed on us in the future including if key employees of ours or a significant number of our associates become ill as a result of contracting the virus given our preference for hiring experienced lenders the average age of an associate of ours may be higher than many of our peers and those of our associates who are of an age that puts them in a higher risk category may be more susceptible to contracting the virus we rely on the services of various key vendors and business partners to service our clients and if those companies businesses or workforces are impacted in ways similar to those that may impact our business our ability to service our customers could be impacted the economic uncertainty caused by covid19s spread and the efforts of government and nongovernmental authorities and the behavior of individuals seeking to slow its spread caused our provision expense for credit losses to increase materially in and may contribute to further elevated levels of provision expense through the duration of the pandemic and any recovery period following its end increased provision levels would negatively impact our capital levels which may impact our ability to pay dividends or cause us to need to access the capital markets to support our capital needs we have also taken efforts to increase our onbalance sheet liquidity and those efforts have caused and may continue to cause our net interest margin to be adversely impacted covid19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses given the speed and unpredictable nature with which the pandemic is evolving and the ongoing and fluid nature of the countrys response to it it is difficult for us to accurately estimate the length and severity of the economic disruption being caused by covid19 or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume as a result the extent to which our results of operations provision expense capital levels liquidity ratios and published credit ratings will be impacted is difficult to predict and depends on among other things new information that may emerge concerning the scope duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic the speed with which the vaccines for covid19 can be widely distributed those vaccines efficacy against the virus and public acceptance of the vaccines the adverse impact of covid19 on the markets in which we operate and on our business financial condition and results of operations is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides our participation in the ppp may expose us to financial liability credit losses compliance costs or reputational damage under the cares act congress created the ppp and authorized the treasury to implement rules regarding the program funding under the original loan program expired on august a second round of ppp funding was approved on december under the coronavirus relief act banks like us and nonbank lenders including bhg facilitated funding under the original program and are facilitating funding currently under the second round of the program on behalf of the sba for borrowers that were or are eligible participants we also remain in the process of receiving and processing requests from our customers for forgiveness of their obligations under their original ppp loans we and other lenders under the ppp may face criticism from customers or others that are seeking forgiveness or applying for funding which may be related to challenges we and others have faced due to inconsistent constantly changing and incomplete rules and guidance adopted by the sba and treasury under the ppp this criticism could cause reputational damage to us and there is a possibility that customers or others may threaten and pursue legal action against banks and other lenders like us and bhg under the program among other regulatory requirements ppp loans are subject to forbearance of loan payments for a tenmonth period to the extent that loans are not eligible for forgiveness if ppp borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness including by failing to use the funds appropriately in order to qualify for forgiveness under the program we and bhg have a greater risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates in addition because of the short time period between the passing of the cares act and the implementation of the ppp there is ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp which exposes us and bhg to risks relating to noncompliance with the ppp there is risk that the sba or another governmental entity could conclude there is a deficiency in the manner in which we or bhg have originated funded or serviced ppp loans which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the cares act or the rules and guidance promulgated by the sba and the treasury regarding the operation of the ppp in the event of such deficiency the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already made payment under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us or bhg since the commencement of the ppp several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks followed in accepting and processing applications for the ppp we and bhg may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation from both customers and noncustomers that contacted us or bhg regarding obtaining ppp loans with respect to the processes and procedures we or bhg used in processing applications for the ppp legal proceedings related to our or bhgs participation in the ppp if not resolved in a manner that is favorable to us or bhg may result in significant financial liability to us or bhg or adversely affect our or bhgs results of operations financial condition or reputation in addition litigation can be costly regardless of outcome any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppprelated litigation could have a material adverse impact on our or bhgs reputation business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny regarding our processing of ppp applications or forgiveness requests or our origination or servicing of ppp loans while the sba has said that in many instances banks may rely on the certifications of borrowers regarding their eligibility for ppp loans we do have several obligations under the ppp and if the sba found that we did not meet those obligations the remedies the sba may seek against us are unknown but may include not guarantying the ppp loans resulting in credit exposure to borrowers who may be unable to repay their loans the ppp may also attract significant interest from federal and state enforcement authorities oversight agencies regulators and congressional committees state attorneys general and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the cares act or the coronavirus relief act and the ppp regulations entitling us to rely on borrower certifications and take more aggressive action against us for alleged violations of the provisions governing our participation in the ppp interest rate risks our net interest margin and consequently our net earnings are significantly affected by interest rate levels our profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on deposits other borrowings subordinated debentures and subordinated notes the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates or that affect the yield curve may affect our level of interest income the largest component of our gross revenue as well as the level of our interest expense interest rate fluctuations are caused by many factors which for the most part are not under our control for example national monetary policy plays a significant role in the determination of interest rates additionally competitor pricing and the resulting negotiations that occur with our customers also impact the rates we collect on loans and the rates we pay on deposits in addition changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate libor or other reference rates or uncertainty related to such potential changes may adversely affect the value of reference ratelinked debt securities that we hold or issue which could further impact our interest rate spread changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets all of which could ultimately affect our results of operations and financial condition a decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds as a result we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions upon terms that are not favorable to us in order to maintain our liquidity if those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments we will incur losses following changes in the general level of interest rates our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase in a rising rate environment or maintain or minimize the decline in in a falling rate environment our loan offering rates minimize increases on our deposit rates in a rising rate environment or promptly reduce the rates we pay on deposits in a falling rate environment and maintain an acceptable level and mix of funding although we have implemented strategies we believe will reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income these strategies may not always be successful and in the case of certain hedging strategies could materially and adversely impact our results of operations if short term interest rates move in a direction that is different than the direction we anticipated at the time we initiated the strategy accordingly changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income and our net interest margin asset quality loan origination volume liquidity and overall profitability we cannot assure you that we can minimize our interest rate risk an important component of our ability to mitigate pressures of a down rate environment will be our ability to reduce the rates we pay on deposits including core deposits if we are unable to reduce these rates because of competitive pricing pressures in our markets liquidity purposes or otherwise our net interest margin will be negatively impacted in addition as our growth in earning assets outpaced growth in our core deposits prior to the covid19 pandemic we had to increase our reliance on noncore funding though our reliance on noncore funding has diminished as a result of increased customer deposits during the pandemic we may experience increased reliance on noncore funding sources as the effects of the pandemic begin to wane these funding sources may be more rate sensitive than our core depositors and accordingly we may be limited in our ability to reduce the rates we pay on these funds while maintaining onbalance sheet liquidity levels consistent with our policies which would negatively impact our net interest margin we seek to limit the amount of noncore funding we utilize to support our growth if we are unable to grow our core funding at rates that are sufficient to match or exceed our loan growth we may be required to slow our loan growth as interest rates change we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities meaning that either our interestbearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interestearning assets usually loans and investment securities or vice versa in either event if market interest rates should move contrary to our position this gap may work against us and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected we attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates maturity repricing characteristics and balances of the different types of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and by utilizing hedging strategies to reduce the impact of changes in rates interest rate risk management techniques are not exact as discussed above from time to time we have repositioned a portion of our investment securities portfolio in an effort to better position our balance sheet for potential changes in shortterm rates we employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income which inherently involve the use of assumptions judgments and estimates while we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ we have entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps and interest rate floors which are designed to lessen elements of our interest rate exposure in addition we have utilized fixedtofloating rate cash flow hedges to manage interest rate exposure for our wholesale borrowings portfolio this hedging strategy converted the liborbased variable interest rate on forecasted borrowings to a fixed interest rate and was used in an effort to protect us from floating interest rate variability in a rising rate environment in the event that interest rates do not change in the manner that we anticipate at the times we institute our hedging strategies or at the pace that we anticipated such transactions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations hedging creates certain risks for us including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended hedge failure risk unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings the performance of our investment securities portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and market conditions including credit deterioration of the issuers of individual securities changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of our investment securities interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or increase unrealized losses in our portfolio interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including monetary policies domestic and international economic social and political issues including trade disputes and global health pandemics and other factors beyond our control fluctuations in interest rates can materially affect both the returns on and market value of our investment securities additionally actual investment income and cash flows from investment securities that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked securities and callable securities may materially differ from those anticipated at the time of investment or subsequently as a result of changes in interest rates and market conditions our investment securities portfolio consists of several securities whose trading markets are not active as a result we utilize alternative methodologies for pricing these securities that include various estimates and assumptions there can be no assurance that we can sell these investment securities at the price derived by these methodologies or that we can sell these investment securities at all which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we monitor the financial position of the various issuers of investment securities in our portfolio including each of the state and local governments and other political subdivisions where we have exposure to the extent we have securities in our portfolio from issuers who have experienced a deterioration of financial condition or who may experience future deterioration of financial condition the value of such securities may decline and could result in an otherthantemporary impairment charge which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity in addition from time to time we may restructure portions of our investment securities portfolio as part of our asset liability management strategies and may incur losses which may be material in connection with any such restructuring changes to libor may adversely affect the holder of the market value of and the interest expense paid on our subordinated notes and our subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities and may affect certain of our loans on july the financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the libor administrator after the announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the libor administrator whether libor will cease to be published or supported during or after or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere however it does appear highly likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of given consumer protection litigation and reputation risks the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly therefore the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of securities based on libor such as our subordinated notes and our subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities in particular regulators industry groups and certain committees eg the alternative reference rates committee have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates eg ameribor or the secured overnight financing rate as the recommended alternative to us dollar libor and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments at this time it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes alternative reference rates the replacement or disappearance of libor or other reforms may adversely affect the value of and the return on our subordinated notes and our subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities as well as the interest we pay on those securities at december approximately of our total loan portfolio was indexed to 30day 90day 180day and oneyear libor many of our loan agreements that are indexed to libor include provisions that do not require us to default to any alternative index recommendations but instead allow us in our sole discretion to designate an alternative interest rate index in the event that libor should become unavailable or unstable while we believe these provisions within our loan agreements address the potential future unavailability of libor there can be no assurance that such provisions will be effective or that they or our actions in this respect will not be challenged by our borrowers credit and lending risks we have a concentration of credit exposure to borrowers in certain industries and we also target small to mediumsized businesses we have meaningful credit exposures to borrowers in certain businesses including commercial and residential building lessors new home builders and hotel and motel owners andor operators certain industries particularly hotel and motel operators experienced adversity during as a result of the covid19 pandemic and as a result an increased level of borrowers in these industries were unable to perform under their loan agreements with us resulting in modifications of these loans or suffered loan downgrades which negatively impacted our results of operations if the negative economic impact of the pandemic extends deep into or beyond these industry or other concentrations could result in increased deterioration in credit quality past dues loan charge offs and collateral value declines which could cause our results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted furthermore any of our large credit exposures that deteriorate unexpectedly could cause us to have to make significant additional credit loss provisions negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition a substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to mediumsized businesses in our market areas as a result a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans primarily to small to mediumsized businesses at december our commercial and industrial loans accounted for approximately of our total loans additionally approximately of our commercial realestate loans at december are owneroccupied commercial real estate loans which are loans to businesses secured by the businesses real estate we expect to seek to expand the amount of these two types of loans in our portfolio during during periods of lower economic growth or challenging economic periods like those resulting from the covid19 pandemic small to mediumsized businesses may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses consequently the ability of such businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition real estate construction and development loans are also an important part of our business this type of lending is generally considered to have relatively high credit risks because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and operation of the related real estate project real estate industry pricing dynamics in the geographical markets in which we operate can vary from year to year and with respect to construction can vary between project funding and project completion asset values to which we underwrite loans can fluctuate from year to year and impact collateral values and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans like regulatory guidelines on commercial real estate loans federal regulators have issued guidance that imposes additional restrictions on banks with construction and development loans in excess of of total riskbased capital if our level of these loans was to exceed these guidelines our ability to make additional loans in this segment would be limited weakness in residential real estate market prices as well as demand could result in price reductions in home and land values adversely affecting the value of collateral securing some of the construction and development loans that we hold should we experience the return of adverse economic and real estate market conditions similar to those we experienced from through we may again experience increases in nonperforming loans and other real estate owned increased losses and expenses from the management and disposition of nonperforming assets increases in provision for credit losses and increases in operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of loans all of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations we make loans to portfolio companies of private equity firms and other loans that qualify as highly leveraged transactions in certain instances these loans may deteriorate and that deterioration may occur quickly if the private equity sponsor is unwilling or unable to provide necessary support we may suffer losses on these loans that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations our ability to grow our loan portfolio may be limited by among other things economic conditions competition within our market areas the timing of loan repayments our ability to grow our core deposits our ability to hire experienced bankers and seasonality our ability to improve our results of operations is dependent upon among other things growing our loan portfolio and increasing net interest income while we believe that our strategy to grow our loan portfolio is sound and our growth targets are achievable over an extended period of time competition within our market areas is significant particularly for borrowers whose businesses were less negatively impacted by the challenging economic conditions of the pandemic we compete with both large regional and national financial institutions who are sometimes able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose to offer and smaller communitybased financial institutions who seek to offer a similar level of service to that which we offer this competition can make loan growth challenging particularly if we are unwilling to price loans at levels that would cause unacceptable levels of compression of our net interest margin or if we are unwilling to structure a loan in a manner that we believe results in a level of risk to us that we are not willing to accept our ability to grow our loan portfolio is also dependent on our ability to fund loan growth we primarily seek to fund our loan growth through stable core deposits but at times our ability to attract core deposits in amounts sufficient to fund our loan growth has been limited by competitive pressures in our markets and our business model that focuses principally on serving small to mediumsized businesses and their owners rather than a broad retail distribution strategy as a result at times our funding sources have consisted of greater amounts of noncore funding larger banks with a more developed retail footprint and nonbanks who are able to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures due to less regulatory oversight are better able to attract lowercost retail deposits than we can which at times causes us to utilize a larger percentage of noncore funding to fund our loan growth though we have grown our core deposits meaningfully during the covid19 pandemic if we are unable to retain or attract core deposits at sufficient levels as the economic disruption from the pandemic lessens to fund our loan growth and our percentage of noncore funding rises to levels that approach our policy limits we may need to modify our growth plans liquidate certain assets participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time any one of which actions could adversely affect our results of operations particularly during periods of time when our net interest margin is experiencing compression moreover loan growth throughout the year can fluctuate due in part to seasonality of the businesses of our borrowers and potential borrowers and the timing on loan repayments particularly those of our borrowers with significant relationships with us resulting from among other things excess levels of liquidity much of our organic loan growth that we have experienced in recent years and a key part of our loan growth strategy in and beyond was the result not of strong loan demand but rather of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions inability to retain these key personnel including key personnel of the businesses we have acquired or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business including in either case as a result of competitive compensation and other hiring and retention pressures at all or at the pace we have anticipated could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals skills and customer relationships andor the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them moreover if these advisors we hire are unable to cause their customers to move their relationships to us in the time periods that we are targeting or at all or if we are unable to retain such business our loan growth may be negatively affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition changes in accounting standards may change the way we calculate our allowance for credit losses the financial accounting standards board and the sec may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements from time to time the impact of these changes or the application thereof on our financial condition and operations can be difficult to predict for example the fasb adopted a new accounting standard that became effective for pinnacle bank beginning january this standard referred to as current expected credit loss or cecl requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial assets including loans and recognize the expected credit losses through provision for credit losses cecl changed the current method of provisioning for loan losses which has required us to increase our allowance for credit losses and is increasing the types and amounts of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of our allowance for credit losses in addition the adoption of cecl may result in more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses an increase to the extent material in our allowance for credit losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our capital levels financial condition and results of operations a reduction in our capital levels could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities and would negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions or other expansion opportunities if we are unable to satisfactorily raise additional capital if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan or securities portfolios our results of operations and financial condition will be negatively impacted we maintain allowances for credit losses on loans securities and offbalance sheet credit exposures if loan customers with significant loan balances individually or in the aggregate fail to repay their loans our results of operations financial condition and capital levels will suffer we make various assumptions and judgments about the expected losses in our loan portfolio including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of any collateral securing the loans utilizing objective and subjective factors we maintain an allowance for credit losses established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense to cover our estimate of the current expected credit losses in our loan and securities portfolios in determining the size of this allowance we utilize estimates based on analyses of volume and types of loans internal loan classifications trends in classifications volume and trends in delinquencies nonaccruals and chargeoffs loss experience of various loan categories national and local economic conditions including unemployment statistics industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors and information actual losses are difficult to forecast especially if those losses stem from factors beyond our historical experience or are otherwise inconsistent with our credit quality assessments if our assumptions are inaccurate our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover potential credit losses and additional provisions may be necessary which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition federal and state regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses or recognize loan chargeoffs their conclusions about the quality of a particular borrower or our entire loan portfolio may be different than ours any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition moreover additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans accounting rule changes like those that contributed to increases levels of provision expense in as a result of our adopting cecl and other factors both within and outside of our managements control these additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models and tools the processes we use to estimate expected credit losses calculate our allowance for credit losses and measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other measures of our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models and tools these models and tools reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances even if these assumptions are accurate the models and tools may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models and tools could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses in the course of business pinnacle bank may acquire through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure properties securing loans it has originated or purchased which are in default particularly in commercial real estate lending there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties in this event pinnacle financial or pinnacle bank might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense the cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we have acquired a number of retail banking facilities and other real properties any of which may contain hazardous or toxic substances if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into certain transactions we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers including financial statements credit reports tax returns and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading personal information financial statements credit reports tax returns or other financial information including information falsely provided as a result of identity theft could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be subject to claims and litigation asserting lender liability from time to time and particularly during periods of economic stress customers including real estate developers and consumer borrowers may make claims or otherwise take legal action pertaining to performance of our responsibilities these claims are often referred to as lender liability claims and are sometimes brought in an effort to produce or increase leverage against us in workout negotiations or debt collection proceedings lender liability claims frequently assert one or more of the following allegations breach of fiduciary duties fraud economic duress breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and similar claims whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of our responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a favorable manner they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect our market reputation products and services as well as potentially affecting customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity liquidity and capital risks liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity represents an institutions ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs the objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs are met and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable we maintain an assetliability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management policy including a contingency funding plan that among other things include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk generally we rely on deposits repayments of loans and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds our principal deposit sources include consumer commercial and public funds customers in our markets we have used these funds together with wholesale deposit sources such as brokered deposits along with federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb cincinnati advances federal funds purchased and other sources of shortterm and longterm borrowings including subordinated indebtedness to make loans acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations an inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect individually or collectively on pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks liquidity our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms attractive to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general for example factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us increased levels of indebtedness a reduction in our published credit ratings any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits limit our access to the capital markets cause our regulators to criticize our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors including demands by customers rates paid by competitors particularly as it relates to brokered deposits and other noncore deposits general interest rate levels returns available to customers on alternative investments government programs general economic and market conditions and other factors loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers ability to repay loans which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses declines in real estate values or markets business closings or layoffs inclement weather natural disasters prolonged government shutdowns and other factors furthermore loans generally are not readily convertible to cash accordingly we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in loans deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations such secondary sources include fhlb cincinnati advances brokered deposits secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks federal reserve borrowings andor accessing the equity or debt capital markets an increase in our reliance on noncore funding particularly brokered time deposits as occurred in would increase our liquidity risk these noncore funding sources can be more rate sensitive than core deposits and the availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions in some instances regulation and to investor assessment of our financial strength and as such the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly andor the availability of such funds may be restricted thus impacting our net interest income our immediate liquidity andor our access to additional liquidity we have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available in the event that our funding strategies call for the use of brokered deposits there can be no assurance that such sources will be available or will remain available or that the cost of such funding sources will be reasonable or that we will be able to offer competitive rates to retain these deposits upon their maturity particularly in a down rate or low rate environment additionally should we no longer be considered wellcapitalized our ability to access new brokered deposits or retain existing brokered deposits could be affected by market conditions regulatory requirements or a combination thereof which could result in most if not all brokered deposit sources being unavailable the inability to utilize brokered deposits as a source of funding could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits loan repayments and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity additionally where necessary the secondary sources of borrowed funds and brokered deposits described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources if we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed or retain these funding sources upon maturity we might be unable to meet our customers or creditors needs which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions federal and state bank regulators require pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations at december pinnacle banks regulatory capital ratios were at wellcapitalized levels under regulatory guidelines growth in assets either organically or as a result of acquisitions at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase capital failure by us to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities and would negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions or other expansion opportunities we may need to raise additional capital including through the issuance of common or preferred stock or additional tier capital instruments in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources or replace expiring capital instruments and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs or in connection with our growth or as a result of deterioration in our asset quality our ability to maintain capital levels sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by negative perceptions of our business or prospects changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions pinnacle bank is required to obtain regulatory approval in order to pay dividends to pinnacle financial unless the amount of such dividends does not exceed its net income for that calendar year plus retained net income for the preceding two years any restriction on the ability of pinnacle bank to pay dividends to pinnacle financial could impact pinnacle financials ability to continue to pay dividends on its capital stock or its ability to pay interest on its indebtedness unexpected changes in requirements for capital resulting from regulatory actions could require us to raise capital at a time and at a price that might be unfavorable or could require that we forego continuing growth or reduce our current loan portfolio we cannot assure you that access to capital will be available to us in needed amounts or on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital andor debt and in turn our liquidity if we cannot raise additional capital when needed our ability to expand through internal growth or acquisitions or to continue operations could be impaired factors that could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or necessary funding include conditions in the capital markets our financial performance our credit ratings regulatory actions and general economic conditions increases in our cost of capital including dilution and increased interest or dividend requirements could have a direct adverse impact on our operating performance and our ability to achieve our growth objectives operational and market risks negative developments in the us and local economy may adversely impact our results in the future our financial performance is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the us as a whole unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth business activity investor or business confidence consumer sentiment limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates natural disasters international trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs terrorist attacks global pandemics acts of war or a combination of these or other factors economic conditions in certain industries in the markets in which we operate deteriorated rapidly in as a result of the covid19 pandemic these challenges manifested themselves primarily within the hotel restaurant retail commercial real estate and entertainment industries and contributed to increased levels of provisions for credit losses a continued worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects including the following a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services we offer an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses a decrease in the value of loans and other assets secured by real estate a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities and an increase in competition resulting from financial services companies although economic conditions have improved in most of our markets when compared to the first and second quarters of and we have returned our focus to growing earning assets we believe that it is possible we will continue to experience an uncertain and volatile economic environment during including as a result of issues of national security covid19 and other health crises around the world and prolonged international trade disputes there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen such conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition over the last several years the federal government has shut down periodically in some cases for prolonged periods it is possible that the federal government may shut down again in the future particularly in light of the evenly divided united states senate if a prolonged government shutdown occurs it could significantly impact business and economic conditions generally or specifically in our principal markets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our operations are principally geographically concentrated in certain markets in the southeastern united states and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability a significant percentage of our borrowers are situated in various msas in tennessee north carolina south carolina and virginia in which we operate in december we also expanded our operations into georgia our success significantly depends upon the growth in population income levels deposits employment levels and housing starts in our markets along with the continued attraction of business ventures to these areas and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in these markets and other markets in which collateral securing our loans is located we cannot assure you that economic conditions including loan demand in these markets will not remain sluggish during or thereafter and as a result we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations and the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively and materially impacted our business may suffer if there are significant declines in the value of real estate the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located if the value of the real estate serving as collateral for our loan portfolio were to decline materially a significant part of our loan portfolio could become undercollateralized if the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined we may not be able to realize the value of the security anticipated when we originated the loan which in turn could have an adverse effect on our allowance and provision for loan and lease losses and our financial condition results of operations and liquidity most of our foreclosed assets are comprised of real estate properties we carry these properties at their estimated fair values less estimated selling costs while we believe the carrying values for such assets are reasonable and appropriately reflect current market conditions there can be no assurance that the values of such assets will not further decline prior to sale or that the amount of proceeds realized upon disposition of foreclosed assets will approximate the carrying value of such assets if the proceeds from any such dispositions are less than the carrying value of foreclosed assets we will record a loss on the disposition of such assets which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations compared to national financial institutions we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies moreover we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or return of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur bhgs results of operations have become a larger portion of our results of operations and challenges in bhgs business that negatively affect its results would now more significantly impact our results pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank collectively hold a interest in bhg our share of bhgs earnings make up a significant portion of our recurring noninterest income and as a result a meaningful portion of our net income while we have a significant stake in bhg are entitled to designate two members of bhgs five person board of managers and in some instances have protective rights to block bhg from engaging in certain activities the other managers and members of bhg may make most decisions regarding bhgs and its subsidiaries operations without our consent or approval this includes a decision to sell the company any sale of all or a portion of our interest in bhg would adversely affect our recurring noninterest income in addition any sale of all or a portion of the other members interest in bhg including in connection with a capital raising transaction could affect our governance rights in bhg and adversely affect our recurring noninterest income moreover there are certain limitations on our ability to sell our interest in bhg without first offering bhg and the other members a right of first refusal and we are prohibited from transferring any portion of our interest without the consent of the other members of bhg prior to march other than transfers in connection with an acquisition of pinnacle financial or pinnacle bank or as a result of a change in applicable law that forces pinnacle financial andor pinnacle bank to divest pinnacle financials or pinnacle banks ownership interests in bhg a significant portion of bhgs revenue and correspondingly our interest in any of bhgs net profits comes from the sale of loans originated by bhg to community banks bhg and its subsidiaries also retain loans that they originate on their balance sheet and earn interest income on those loans recently bhg has been retaining more of the loans that it originates on its balance sheet this practice requires more external funding of bhgs business than the historical practice of routinely selling loans to other financial institutions and will likely increase bhgs funding costs it also increases bhgs exposure to credit losses in its portfolio which losses could materially and adversely impact bhgs results of operations and pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks interest in bhgs net profits if bhg is unable to secure the necessary funding for this change in its business model it may be required to return to a business model that focuses more on a gain on sale approach that could negatively impact bhgs results and our noninterest income contributed by our investment in bhg future contributions to our earnings from bhg and its subsidiaries will require that they continue to grow their business and increase the amount of loans that they are able to originate and sell if not retained on bhgs or a subsidiarys balance sheet in the event that bhgs loan growth slows over historical levels its loan sales decrease including but not limited to as a result of regulatory restrictions on banks that are the principal purchasers of bhgs loans or it experiences increased levels of loan losses or requests for substitutions and loans it previously originated and sold its results of operations and our noninterest income would be adversely affected bhg currently operates in most states without the need for a permit or any other license as its loans are principally commercial business purpose loans that dont trigger the need for licensure in the event that bhg or its subsidiaries were required to register or become licensed in any state in which they operate including as a result of their expanding into consumer lending or expanding into other lending areas like patient financing or regulations are adopted that seek to limit bhgs or its subsidiaries ability to operate in any jurisdiction or that seek to limit the amounts of interest that bhg can charge on its loans bhgs results of operations and pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks interest in bhgs net profits could be materially and adversely affected recently bhg has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms like attorneys accountants and others through subsidiaries that it owns it also has expanded into patient financing which involves making loans to individuals to finance medical expenses particularly those where patients have high deductible health plans bhg may further expand its business into other types of lending which may not be as profitable as bhgs current lending products or successful at all these new product lines may involve more risk than bhgs historical business and bhgs loss rates may increase when compared to historical levels moreover bhg and its subsidiaries will likely face greater regulatory scrutiny in certain of these lines of business that may increase bhgs compliance costs and its risk of regulatory scrutiny failure to realize the expected revenue increases andor other projected benefits from and any increased compliance costs and regulatory scrutiny in connection with any such expansion could have a negative impact on bhgs business which would negatively impact our interest in bhgs profits bhgs business is also subject to increased scrutiny by bank regulatory agencies as a result of our investment the fdic has published guidance related to the operation of marketplace lenders and banks business relationships with such lenders and other third parties in which banks are required to exercise increased oversight and ongoing monitoring and other responsibility for such third parties compliance with applicable regulatory guidance and requirements as a result we are subject to enhanced responsibility for and risk related to bhg and our relationship with it bhgs compliance costs have increased since our investment and are likely to continue to increase including as a result of its new product lines and its loan yields may be negatively impacted which would negatively impact its results of operations and pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks interest in bhgs net profits if banks that are examined by the fdic became restricted in their ability to buy loans originated by bhg bhgs business would be negatively impacted which would negatively impact our interest in bhgs profits because of our ownership of a portion of bhg bhg is limited in the types of activities in which it may engage were bhg to desire to expand its operations into areas that are not permissible for an entity owned by a state member bank like pinnacle bank it may need to do so through separate entities in which we do not have an ownership interest were these businesses to be more profitable than bhgs core business or require bhgs managements attention in ways that are detrimental to bhg our investment in bhg may be negatively impacted a decline in our stock price or expected future cash flows or a material adverse change in our results of operations or prospects could result in impairment of our goodwill a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization below book value a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of our goodwill at december our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled approximately billion if we were to conclude that a writedown of our goodwill is necessary then the appropriate charge would likely cause a material loss any significant loss would adversely impact the capacity of pinnacle bank to pay dividends to pinnacle financial without seeking prior regulatory approval which could adversely affect pinnacle financials ability to pay required interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness or to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders our selection of accounting policies and methods may affect our reported financial results our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with gaap and reflect managements judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations they require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters we may be required to do one or more of the following significantly increase the allowance for credit losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided recognize significant impairment on goodwill and other intangible asset balances reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value or significantly increase our accrued tax liability any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for a discussion of our critical accounting policies see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we currently invest in bank owned life insurance boli and may continue to do so in the future we had million in general hybrid and separate account boli contracts at december boli is an illiquid longterm asset that provides tax savings because cash value growth and life insurance proceeds are not taxable subject to certain exceptions however if we needed additional liquidity and converted the boli to cash such transaction would be subject to ordinary income tax and applicable penalties we are also exposed to the credit risk of the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and to the insurance carriers credit risk in a general account contract if boli was exchanged to another carrier additional fees would be incurred and a taxfree exchange could only be done for insureds that were still actively employed by us at that time there is interest rate risk relating to the market value of the underlying investment securities associated with the boli in that there is no assurance that the market value of these securities will not decline investing in boli exposes us to liquidity credit and interest rate risk which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity the fair values of our investments in private companies and venture capital funds are likely to fluctuate and the value that we ultimately realize on those investments may vary materially from time to time we and our affiliates including pinnacle bank make investments in private companies and venture capital funds the fair value of these investments are reflected in our financial statements and are adjusted on a quarterly basis moreover because valuations of private companies are inherently uncertain may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates our determinations of fair value for private companies may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed therefore fair value determinations may materially understate or overstate the value that we ultimately realize upon the sale of one or more investments we cannot predict future realized or unrealized gains or losses and any such gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period an ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks andor losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences we have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure this framework is comprised of various processes systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject including among others credit market liquidity operational capital compliance strategic and reputational risks our framework also includes financial analytical forecasting or other modeling methodologies which involves management assumptions and judgment in addition our board of directors in consultation with management has adopted a risk appetite statement which sets forth certain thresholds and limits to govern our overall risk profile however there is no assurance that our risk management framework including the risk metrics under our risk appetite statement will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us if our risk management framework is not effective we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to regulatory consequences as a result of which our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected we are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and thirdparty servicers and systems failures interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as cause legal or reputational harm we are dependent upon information technologies computer systems and networks including those we maintain and those maintained and provided to us by third parties to conduct operations and are reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business these systems could become unavailable or impaired due to a variety of causes including storms and other natural disasters terrorist attacks fires utility outages internal or external theft or fraud design defects human error misconduct or complications or failures encountered as existing systems are maintained replaced or upgraded for example our financial accounting data processing or other operating or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties upon which we rely may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services in the event that backup systems are utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and we may experience data losses in the course of such recovery we continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions that may occur in the course of such implementation challenges we maintain a system of internal controls and security to mitigate the risks of many of these occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for certain risks however should an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls causes an interruption degradation or outage in service or is uninsured against or in excess of applicable insurance limits such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential proprietary personal and other information in our computer systems and networks although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant the security of our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches unauthorized access misuse computer viruses ransomware or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely including over the internet or through their mobile device the secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking our network and the systems of parties with whom we contract or on which we rely as well as those of our customers and regulators could be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses phishing schemes spam attacks human error natural disasters power loss and other security breaches sources of attacks vary and may include hackers disgruntled employees or vendors organized crime terrorists foreign governments corporate espionage and activists in recent periods there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity security breaches and cyberattacks within the financial services industry especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal use of webbased products and applications even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more prevalent and sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent the techniques used by bad actors change frequently may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred additionally the existence of cyber attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data such as vendors may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner consistent with industry trends we remain at risk for attempted electronic fraudulent activity as well as attempts at security breaches and cybersecurityrelated incidents cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing service disruptions in cloud technologies may lead to delays in accessing or the loss of data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients access to our products and services we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses to the extent that our activities or the activities of our vendors regulators or customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information security breaches including breaches of security of customer vendor or regulatory systems and networks and viruses could expose us to claims litigation and other possible liabilities which may be significant any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation results of operations and ability to attract and retain customers and businesses further a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage we outsource many of our major systems such as data processing loan servicing and deposit processing systems the failure of these systems or the termination of a thirdparty software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based could interrupt our operations because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such thirdparty systems fail or experience interruptions if sustained or repeated a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans gather deposits and provide customer service compromise our ability to operate effectively damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business andor subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we also face the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities including vendors exchanges and other financial intermediaries such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure and could disclose such attack or breach to us in a delayed manner or not at all in addition we may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to our customers systems our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats and the continued uncertain global economic environment as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or respond to any changes to state or federal regulations policy statements or laws concerning information systems or security any failure to maintain adequate security over our information systems our technologydriven products and services or our customers personal and transactional information could negatively affect our business and our reputation and result in fines penalties or other costs including litigation expense andor additional compliance costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities disruption to our operations and business misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information andor that of our customers or damage to our customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition our business reputation and relationships are important and any damage to them could have a material adverse effect on our business our reputation is very important in sustaining our business and we rely on our relationships with our current former and potential clients and shareholders and other actors in the industries that we serve any damage to our reputation whether arising from regulatory supervisory or enforcement actions matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with sec and exchange listing requirements negative publicity the way in which we conduct our business or otherwise could strain our existing relationships and make it difficult for us to develop new relationships any such damage to our reputation and relationships could in turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business we face substantial competition and are subject to certain regulatory constraints not applicable to some of our competitors which may decrease our growth or profits we face substantial competition for deposits and for credit and trust relationships and other financial services and products in the communities we serve competing providers include other banks thrifts and trust companies insurance companies mortgage banking operations credit unions finance companies title companies money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies including mobile payment platforms which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by us competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve in addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services our competitors include securities dealers brokers mortgage bankers investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer onestop financial services to their customers that may include services that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past the increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers if we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences our financial performance could be adversely affected some of our competitors including credit unions are not subject to certain regulatory constraints such as the community reinvestment act which requires us to among other things implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve credit unions also have federal tax exemptions that may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks in addition nondepository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions like pinnacle bank that offer federally insured deposits other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products these differences in resources regulation competitive advantages and business strategy may decrease our net interest margin may increase our operating costs and may make it harder for us to compete profitably the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation for example the growth act and certain implementing regulations significantly reduce the regulatory burden of certain large bank holding companies and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bank holding companies to become more competitive to more aggressively pursue expansion or to more readily consolidate with similar sized financial institutions also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as mobile payment and other automatic transfer and payment systems and for banks that do not have a physical presence in our markets to compete for deposits the absence of regulatory requirements may give nonbank financial companies a competitive advantage over us the implementation of other new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk we continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in the future there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we undergo a new product process to assess the risks of the initiative and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls policies and procedures to mitigate those risks including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business andor a new product or service furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business andor new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations inability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers reduce growth and adversely affect our business we have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in our markets moreover much of our organic loan growth that we have experienced in recent years and that we are seeking during was the result not of strong loan demand but rather of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions we are continuing to deploy a similar hiring strategy in the carolinas and virginia and we are in the early stages of deploying such strategy in atlanta inability to retain these key personnel including key personnel of the businesses we have acquired or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business including in either case as a result of competitive compensation and other hiring and retention pressures at all or at the pace we have anticipated could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals skills and customer relationships andor the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them moreover the higher costs we have to pay to hire and retain these experienced individuals could cause our noninterest expense levels to rise and negatively impact our results of operations many of our key associates and those we seek to hire are experienced bankers who have been engaged in the business of commercial banking for a significant period of time while we believe this model of hiring has contributed to our success we face risks associated with this older workforce our healthcare costs may exceed those of our peers on account of our older associate base additionally as a number of our longterm employees approach retirement age our ability to successfully plan for the transition of those associates clients to other associates becomes more important to our future success if we are unable to successfully manage such transitions our relationships with our clients may be negatively impacted and our results of operations may be negatively affected we are subject to regulatory oversight and certain litigation and our expenses related to this regulatory oversight and litigation may adversely affect our results we are from time to time subject to certain litigation in the ordinary course of our business as we have aggressively hired new revenue producing associates over the last five years we and the associates we have hired have also periodically been the subject of litigation and threatened litigation with these associates former employers we may also be subject to claims related to our loan servicing programs particularly those involving servicing of commercial real estate loans these and other claims and legal actions as well as supervisory and enforcement actions by our regulators including the cfpb or other regulatory agencies with which we deal including those with oversight of our loan servicing programs could involve large monetary claims capital directives agreements with federal regulators cease and desist penalties and orders and significant defense costs the outcome of any such cases or actions is uncertain substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects in accordance with gaap for matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is established for matters where it is probable we will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated we establish an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted periodically to reflect any relevant developments the actual cost of any outstanding legal proceedings or threatened claims however may turn out to be substantially higher than the amount accrued further our insurance may not cover all litigation other proceedings or claims or the costs of defense future developments could result in an unfavorable outcome for any existing or new lawsuits or investigations in which we are or may become involved which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations our business is dependent on technology and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven solutions and as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems as well as nontraditional alternatives like crowdfunding and digital wallets in addition to better serving customers the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs the importance of technology has been sharpened as a result of covid19 and will likely remain even after the pandemic wanes we have made significant investments in data processing management information systems and internet banking accessibility our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create additional efficiencies in our operations through the use of technology many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we cannot make assurances that our technological improvements will increase our operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technologydriven solutions or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and financial stability of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to various counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial and correspondent banks and others including those with whom we have implemented our hedging strategies as a result defaults by or rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally may result in marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by such other institutions such occurrences could expose us to credit risk in the event of default of one or more counterparties and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity we may be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time as part of our normal course of business customers may make claims and take legal action against us based on actions or inactions related to the fiduciary responsibilities of pinnacle banks trust and wealth management associates if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in financial liability andor adversely affect our market reputation or our products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations natural disasters may adversely affect us our operations and customer base are located in markets where natural disasters including tornadoes severe storms fires wildfires floods and hurricanes often occur such natural disasters could significantly impact the local population and economies and our business and could pose physical risks to our properties although our banking offices are geographically dispersed throughout portions of the southeastern united states and we maintain insurance coverages for such events a significant natural disaster in or near one or more of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results as a result current and potential holders of our securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities maintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanesoxley act is expensive and requires significant management attention moreover as we continue to grow our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance failure to implement effective controls or difficulties encountered in the process may harm our results of operations and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports we may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions including the potential delisting of our securities from the nasdaq global select market this could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as well as the trading price of our securities and could potentially subject us to litigation risks related to acquisition activity our acquisitions and future expansion may result in additional risks from through we completed the acquisitions of capitalmark magna avenue and bnc and made a significant investment in bhg in we acquired advocate capital we expect to continue to consider and explore opportunities to expand in our current markets and in select primarily highgrowth markets located outside of tennessee in the southern portion of the united states through additional branches and also may consider expansion within these markets through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions including our recent expansion into the atlanta georgia metro market on a de novo basis late in these types of expansions including the atlanta expansion involve various risks including management of growth we may be unable to successfully maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth identify and expand into suitable markets obtain regulatory and other approvals identify and acquire suitable sites for new banking offices attract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth recruit seasoned professionals with significant experience and established books of business maintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital scale our technology platform and operational infrastructure avoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth maintain adequate internal audit loan review and compliance functions and implement additional policies internal controls procedures and operating systems required to support such growth results of operations there is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we add new offices and staff our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to evaluate opportunities to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets development of offices there are considerable costs involved in opening branches particularly those in new markets and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more accordingly any new branches we establish including those we plan to establish in atlanta can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale the same is true for our efforts to expand in these markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant experience in that market our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our new branches we may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites difficulties in acquiring such sites failure or inability to receive any required regulatory approvals increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors finally we have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired as the case may be regulatory and economic factors our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events failure or inability to obtain required regulatory approvals changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our other markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets infrastructure and control s we may not successfully implement improvements to or integrate our information and control systems procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls in particular our systems controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in transaction volume and the infrastructure that comes with new products branches markets or any combination thereof thus our growth strategy may divert management from our existing operation and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure which may adversely affect earnings shareholder returns and our efficiency ratio failure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion in atlanta or in any other future market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy also if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we may face risks with respect to future acquisitions when we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions as we did from through we seek targets that are culturally similar to us have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services in addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above in general acquiring or merging with other banks businesses or branches particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit operations culture management and market risks with respect to an institution we acquire or with which we merge the time and costs of evaluating new markets hiring experienced local management including as a result of de novo expansion into a market such as our expansion into the atlanta georgia metro market at the end of and opening new bank locations and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur particularly in the first to months of operations our ability to finance or increase capital levels in connection with an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders the diversion of our managements attention to the negotiation of a transaction and integration of an acquired companys operations with ours the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations entry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience closing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire the inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all including as a result of community objections or such approvals being restrictively conditional and risks associated with integrating the operations technologies and personnel of the acquired business though we expect to remain principally focused on organically growing our business in our existing markets including our new market in atlanta during we nonetheless may have opportunities to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets as well as other markets throughout the southern portion of the united states and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time generally acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions many of which may have greater financial resources than we do when considering acquisition opportunities particularly in our targeted highgrowth markets located outside of tennessee accordingly attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential future acquisitions regulatory and compliance risks national or state legislation or regulation may increase our expenses and reduce earnings bank regulators are increasing regulatory scrutiny and additional restrictions including those originating from the doddfrank act on financial institutions have been proposed or adopted by regulators and by congress changes in tax law federal legislation regulation or policies such as bankruptcy laws deposit insurance consumer protection laws and capital requirements among others can result in significant increases in our expenses andor chargeoffs which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition changes in state or federal tax laws or regulations can have a similar impact state and municipal governments including the state of tennessee could seek to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies which could have a meaningful impact on our results of operations furthermore financial institution regulatory agencies are expected to continue to be aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations including the continued issuance of additional formal or informal enforcement or supervisory actions these actions whether formal or informal could result in our agreeing to limitations or to take actions that limit our operational flexibility restrict our growth increase our operating expenses or increase our capital or liquidity levels failure to comply with any formal or informal regulatory restrictions including informal supervisory actions could lead to further regulatory enforcement actions negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of recently enacted or new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations including our ability to originate or sell loans and adversely impact our financial performance in addition industry legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction capital strategies compensation or operating plans we are subject to various statutes and regulations that may impose additional costs or limit our ability to take certain actions we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities including payment of dividends mergers and acquisitions investments loans and interest rates charged on loans interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices we are also subject to capital requirements established by our regulators which require us to maintain specified levels of capital it is possible that our fdic assessments may increase in the future any future assessment increases could negatively impact our results of operations significant changes in laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have been recently adopted and others are being considered in congress we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of commercial banks and bank holding companies our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably additionally we are subject to laws regarding our handling disclosure and processing of personal and confidential information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the grammleachbliley act requires us to periodically disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers we are subject to laws that require us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information additionally other legislative and regulatory activity continue to lend uncertainty to privacy compliance requirements that impact our business we also expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions the potential effects of pending legislation are farreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply we must maintain adequate regulatory capital to support our business objectives under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements we must satisfy capital requirements based upon quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items our satisfaction of these requirements is subject to qualitative judgments by regulators that may differ materially from managements and that are subject to being determined retroactively for prior periods additionally regulators can make subjective assessments about the adequacy of capital levels even if our bank subsidiarys reported capital exceeds the wellcapitalized requirements our ability to maintain our status as a financial holding company and to continue to operate pinnacle bank as we have in recent periods is dependent upon a number of factors including pinnacle bank qualifying as well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action regulations and upon our qualifying on an ongoing basis as well capitalized and well managed under applicable federal reserve regulations failure to meet regulatory capital standards could have a material adverse effect on our business including damaging the confidence of customers in us adversely impacting our reputation and competitive position and retention of key personnel any of these developments could limit our access to brokered deposits the federal reserve discount window advances from the fhlb capital markets transactions and development of new financial services failure to meet regulatory capital standards may also result in higher fdic assessments if we fall below guidelines for being deemed adequately capitalized the fdic or federal reserve could impose restrictions on our activities and a broad range of regulatory requirements in order to effect prompt corrective action the capital requirements applicable to us are in a process of continuous evaluation and revision in connection with actions of the basel committee our regulators and the requirements of the doddfrank act we cannot predict the final form or the effects of these regulations on our business but among the possible effects are requirements that we slow our rate of growth or obtain additional capital which could reduce our earnings or dilute our existing shareholders pinnacle financial is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for pinnacle bank in times of stress under federal law pinnacle financial is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to pinnacle bank and to commit resources to support pinnacle bank if necessary pinnacle financial may be required to commit additional resources to pinnacle bank at times when pinnacle financial may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in pinnacle financials or its shareholders or its creditors best interests to do so providing such support is more likely during times of financial stress for pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank which may make any capital pinnacle financial is required to raise to provide such support more expensive or dilutive than it might otherwise be in addition any capital loans pinnacle financial makes to pinnacle bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of pinnacle bank in the event of pinnacle financials bankruptcy any commitment by it to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of pinnacle bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment noncompliance with the usa patriot act the bank secrecy act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us or restrict our ability to make acquisitions the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of requires financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities if such activities are detected financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the us treasury departments office of financial crimes enforcement network these rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches as well as additional operating expenses to add staff andor technological enhancements to our systems to better comply with our obligations failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations risks relating to our securities the price of our capital stock may be volatile or may decline the trading price of our capital stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings estimates speculation in the press or investment community strategic actions by us or our competitors actions by institutional shareholders fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors general market conditions and in particular developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry market perceptions about the innovation economy including levels of funding or exit activities of companies in the industries we serve proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments changes in the political climate market reactions to social media messages or posts anticipated or pending investigations proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us and domestic and international economic and social factors unrelated to our performance the trading price of the shares of our common stock and the depositary shares representing fractional interests in our series b preferred stock and the value of our other securities will further depend on many factors which may change from time to time including without limitation our financial condition performance creditworthiness and prospects and future sales of our equity or equityrelated securities in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation as well as the loss of key employees our ability to declare and pay dividends is limited while our board of directors has approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of and approved the payment of the quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock and underlying depositary shares since issuance there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our capital stock in the future future dividends if any will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors including our and pinnacle banks capital levels moreover our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the terms of our series b preferred stock which provides that if we have not paid dividends on the series b preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period then no dividend or distribution shall be declared paid or set aside for payment on shares of our common stock our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be cash we may hold from time to time as well as dividends that we receive from pinnacle bank although pinnacle banks asset quality earnings performance liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our capital stock our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from pinnacle bank federal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay and that pinnacle bank may declare and pay to us for example federal reserve regulations implementing the capital rules required under basel iii do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers in addition the federal reserve has issued supervisory guidance advising bank holding companies to eliminate defer or reduce dividends paid on common stock and other forms of capital like the series b preferred stock where the companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters net of dividends previously paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends the companys prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition or the company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios recent supplements to this guidance reiterate the need for bank holding companies to inform their applicable reserve bank sufficiently in advance of the proposed payment of a dividend in certain circumstances in addition subject to certain exceptions the terms of our subordinated debentures including the subordinated debentures we assumed upon the consummation of the bnc merger prohibit us from paying dividends on shares of our capital stock at times when we are deferring the payment of interest on such subordinated debentures we may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders we may issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock including in connection with acquisitions we may sell these shares at prices below the then current market price of shares and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership we could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions as we did in connection with our acquisition of bnc and our other recent acquisitions or investments in feerelated or other businesses as we did with bhg which could also dilute shareholder ownership we have the ability under our current effective registration statement to issue shares of preferred stock further our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to  of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders which is what we did when we issued the series b preferred stock we may determine that it is advisable or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary to issue additional shares of preferred stock securities convertible into exchangeable for or that represent an interest in preferred stock or preferred stockequivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders including issuing additional shares of our series b preferred stock or additional depositary shares our board of directors also has the power without shareholder approval to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights dividend rights and preferences over the series b preferred stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution liquidation or windingup and other terms although the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least twothirds of all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock voting together as a single class with any parity stock having similar voting rights is required to authorize or issue any shares of capital stock senior in rights and preferences to the series b preferred stock if we issue preferred stock or depositary shares in the future with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the series b preferred stock or depositary shares the rights of holders of the depositary shares or the market price of the depositary shares could be adversely affected the market price of the depositary shares could decline as a result of these other offerings as well as other sales of a large block of depositary shares series b preferred stock or similar securities in the market thereafter or the perception that such sales could occur holders of the series b preferred stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of the depositary shares bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of the depositary shares and diluting their holdings in the depositary shares the series b preferred stock constitutes an equity security and ranks junior to all of our and our subsidiaries existing indebtedness and will rank junior to our and our subsidiaries future indebtedness shares of the series b preferred stock are equity interests in pinnacle financial and do not constitute indebtedness accordingly shares of the series b preferred stock and the related depositary shares are and will be junior in right of payment to any existing and all future indebtedness and other nonequity claims of pinnacle financial with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us including in a liquidation of pinnacle financial in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or windingup our assets will be available to pay obligations on the series b preferred stock and any parity stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid and any obligations we owe on any securities that rank senior to the series b preferred stock then outstanding if any have been satisfied in case of such bankruptcy liquidation dissolution or windingup the series b preferred stock will rank equally with any parity stock in the distribution of our assets holders of the depositary shares may be fully subordinated to interests held by the us government in the event of a receivership insolvency liquidation or similar proceeding in addition our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payment of dividends on the series b preferred stock the series b preferred stock and the depositary shares representing the series b preferred stock effectively rank junior to any existing and all future liabilities of our subsidiaries we are a financial holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our right to participate in any distribution of the assets of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation reorganization receivership or conservatorship of any subsidiary and thus the ability of the holder of the series b preferred stock and the holders of the depositary shares to benefit indirectly from such distribution will rank junior to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors in the event of bankruptcy liquidation or windingup there may not be sufficient assets remaining after paying our and our subsidiaries liabilities to pay amounts due on any or all of the series b preferred stock and the depositary shares representing the series b preferred stock then outstanding we together with pinnacle bank own of the outstanding equity interests of bhg our right to participate in any distribution of the assets of bhg upon its liquidation reorganization receivership or conservatorship and thus the ability of the holders of the series b preferred stock and the holders of the depositary shares to benefit indirectly from such distribution will rank junior to the prior claims of bhgs creditors moreover our ownership interest in bhg and minority board representation on bhgs board means that we and pinnacle bank cannot on our own cause bhg to make distributions to us and pinnacle bank that could be used to pay dividends on the series b preferred stock in addition bhg is a party to various loan agreements pursuant to which bhgs ability to make distributions to us may be limited the series b preferred stock and the depositary shares representing the series b preferred stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions subject only to the limited voting rights of the shares of series b preferred stock the holders of the series b preferred stock and therefore the holders of the depositary shares representing the series b preferred stock have limited voting rights dividends on the series b preferred stock are noncumulative and discretionary if we do not declare dividends on the series b preferred stock holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive related distributions on their depositary shares dividends on the series b preferred stock are noncumulative and discretionary not mandatory consequently if our board of directors does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period the holder of the series b preferred stock and therefore the holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive a dividend for such period and such undeclared dividend will not accrue and be payable we will have no obligation to pay dividends for such dividend period whether or not dividends are authorized and declared for any subsequent dividend period with respect to the series b preferred stock our board of directors may determine that it would be in our best interests to pay less than the full amount of the stated dividends on the
