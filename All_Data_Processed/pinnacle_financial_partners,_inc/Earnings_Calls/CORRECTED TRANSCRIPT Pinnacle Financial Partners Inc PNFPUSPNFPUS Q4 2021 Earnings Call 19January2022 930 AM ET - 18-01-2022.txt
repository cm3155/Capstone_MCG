president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thank you gigi well start just a minute as we always do with the dashboard the dashboard is intended to provide you the best insight possible as to what we at pinnacle view to be important what were managing to and the fact that we begin every quarter with the same dashboard at a minimum should showcase our relentless focus on these critical variables in short were tightly focused on eps growth and tangible book value per share accretion revenue growth and asset quality thats what we set aggressive targets for thats what we persistently talk about in our organization thats how both our short and longterm incentives are built simply said thinking about those critical variables that we focus on fourth quarter was another fabulous quarter for our firm with very strong core loan growth core deposit growth net interest income growth fee income growth yearoveryear preprovision net revenue growth tangible book value per share accretion and asset quality metrics beginning with the gaap metrics i might focus your attention particularly on the asset quality metrics at the bottom of the slide the green bars show the median quarterly performance over the last five years and as you can see our asset quality over the last five years has been very strong but for all three measures even with very strong performance over the last five years problem loan metrics continue to trend down and are at decadelong lows moving now to the nongaap measures on which im most focused you can see across the top row the extraordinary growth in revenue and earnings on the second row the extraordinary balance sheet growth which of course for our firm is our primary mechanism for growing revenue and earnings going forward and on the far right of that second row you can see the reliability of the tangible book value per share accretion so for me feet the conclusion is that were continuing to execute at a very high level on virtually every critical success measure for our firm now im going to turn it over to harold to talk in more depth about our performance and then ill come back and try to do a little contextsetting in terms of where weve been and where were headed harold harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody as usual we will start with loans and again the fourth quarter was another great loan growth quarter for us and provided us with strong momentum as we enter excluding ppp average loans were up annualized between the third and fourth quarter overall loan rates were down in the fourth quarter due to reduced inflows of ppp on our loan yields we recognized million in ppp revenues in the fourth quarter down from million in the third quarter due to ppp balances decreasing to approximately million at the end of the fourth quarter we anticipate ppp revenues will range between million and million in compared to approximately million in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 weve been getting a lot of questions about loan floors and their impact on our yields in a rising rate environment im not about to apologize for our loan floors because we enjoyed the ongoing benefit of these floors for quite some time but they will cause us to experience some lag on realizing the full benefit of rate hikes in the near term as the bottom left chart indicates of our daily float loans will realize the full benefit of rate increases on day one that number increases to almost after the first basis points in rate hikes like i said our relationship managers have done a great job in securing loan floors over the past several years and it has paid handsome dividends to us lastly our market leaders are excited about our loan growth prospects ph and so the to growth rate in endofperiod loans inclusive of the remaining ppp forgiveness for is a reasonable objective for our firm at this time in our new markets including atlanta and our new specialty lending units provided approximately million in loan growth our view for is that these markets including washington dc and the specialty units should contribute to times that amount in the coming year now to deposits we had yet another big deposit growth quarter core deposits were up almost billion in the fourth quarter weve experienced significant growth in the noninterestbearing deposits ending up at billion at quarterend up since the end of last year our average deposit rates were basis points while our endofperiod deposit rates were slightly less at basis points given the current rate outlook we are likely approaching floors on deposit rates with our primary opportunities in nearterm cd renewals helping us will be billion in maturing cds in with an average rate of approximately basis points as to volumes and the projected growth for deposits the macro environment is shifting and thus we have to believe that deposit growth will eventually find its way back to our traditional growth strategy with reliance on attracting the best bankers and having them bring their best clients to our firm weve never abandoned our longterm view that core deposit growth is a key strategic objective and even though the last few years have provided us an ample supply of funding initially we will need to get back to a more intense focus on funding our balance sheet growth with core deposits that said we like our chances given the significant investment weve made in relationship managers and new markets over the last few years we continue to look at ways to create increased earnings momentum through deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets and the elimination of wholesale funding sources we are optimistic that loan growth in should help to reduce our overall liquidity but reducing our liquidity to a more normalized level we believe will be a multiyear effort our objective here is to find ways to put money to work in a rising rate environment and not placing too much pressure on tangible book value growth during the fourth quarter our investment securities increased by approximately million almost a little over of our purchases in the fourth quarter were bonds on the shortend of the curve say less than three years with an average rate of approximately we also increased our investment in a collateralized repo investment by million which yields approximately basis points we are not currently pursuing a formalized strategy to deploy our excess liquidity which is approximately billion into longer term investments even though the 10year ph is pricing at around currently we will pick our spots and invest along the curve in a prudent manner we do believe we have some pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 opportunities on the shortend of the curve to put some money to work at slightly higher yield but this will be a modest response say an additional million in deployment in the first quarter as the gray bars on the top left chart reflect i believe weve done a remarkable job defending our margins over the last two years we tend to hover in the range and well work ph hard to thin our margins going forward obviously we like everyone else look forward to a robust uprate environment in as we think we will win with a rising yield curve but even if that doesnt materialize our track record would indicate that we are very capable of managing our balance sheet regardless of the rate environment as to credit we are again presenting the four big traditional credit metrics of net chargeoffs classified nonperformers and past due accruing loans pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well and again these are some of the best credit metrics ratios weve experienced in our history modifications made pursuant to the section of the cares act continue to decrease from million at june to million at september and now stand at million at december importantly and as noted in the highlights on the slide we do anticipate further declines in our allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio over the next several quarters given continued improvement in our credit metrics as well as macroeconomic factors now to fee income again lots of good news here and over the course of we spent quite a bit of time on our various fee categories for the fourth quarter fee revenues were up more than over the same quarter last year as for run rates for were anticipating high single to low doubledigit increases in fee revenues this year inclusive of bhg which were estimating approximately growth and well speak to that in a few minutes also included in our planning assertion is that we are not anticipating a repeat of million in income weve experienced in from valuation adjustments for several of our joint venture investments we are planning for revenues from these investments to be significantly less in other than that our wealth management mortgage and other feebased business lines believe theyre ready for a breakout year in as to expenses i was not going to spend a great deal of time on expenses but given the last slide i provided i feel i need to pause here and provide some more color particularly around our expense plan for i think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive cost to our expense base and the direct correlation to corporate results more on that in just a second was a great year for our associates and to say we are pleased to deliver an outsized incentive to our associates for their effort is a profound understatement we are elated at being able to provide this to them and thank our board for supporting us in this effort as to our overall total expense run rate we anticipate low doubledigit percentage growth in which is primarily attributable to head count growth and the new markets we also are aiming for a recruiting year in that will be even more prolific than what we experienced in terry will discuss more on that in a few minutes as to incentives our current plan is that our incentives will increase by to in should we achieve our performance targets thats right we hope and desire our incentives to go up in the increase is based on head count adds in and our planned recruiting in we are reducing our target pay in our annual bonus plan from the outsized amount of of target back to the traditional of target but we are also providing ph more cost to our equity plans for our leadership as well as our associates who will all receive some form of stock compensation so why should shareholders be okay with all of this substantially all of our incentive costs are performance based our annual bonus plan which is about twothirds of our annual expense is entirely performancebased pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 that performance is not based on individual results but on corporate earnings ppnr and soundness targets our thesis our secret sauce is that the right combination for achievement of topquartile earnings growth and soundness will result in higher multiples on our shares over time this time last year pnfp street estimates for were a share after first quarter earnings that number increased to around a share internally we knew those targets would not give us the share performance we desire so our targets were higher which was basically what we do practically every year we finished at so our targets are set to achieve topquartile performance over the longterm if we dont achieve our targets then the bonus pools are reduced and in many years that number has resulted in payout thus every year there is a cushion and for indiscernible we are finalizing our incentive plans for currently but nothing of substance will change our incentives will be performancebased and we will target topquartile performance my best guess is that given the environment today and the uncertainties that are still prevalent we have another meaningful stretch goal in front of us for quickly some comments on capital the board approved an increase of our dividends per common share to from yesterday a increase during we redeemed million of sub debt issuances from available cash we get calls consistently about issuing new sub debt given interest rates that some of our peers have been obtaining but we like our capital stack currently that said we will continue to monitor the debt markets and access them as it appears to be advantageous to us and as i have mentioned several times before and i want to just reinforce the point weve intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a peer relative component in our leaderships equity compensation plan we are currently calculating the annualized increase of in our tangible book value per share at yearend compared to our equity program plan is designed such that our leadership wins if our tangible book value per share growth our return on tangible common equity and our total shareholder return outperforms in relation to our peers as i alluded to earlier we believe our incentive programs are objective not subjective and to be candid very unique in design and we believe allows our ph management with shareholders to accept rapid shareholder value creation this slide is a summary of our outlook for we wont go into this slide in depth as weve covered much of this previously was a great year for us and with significant momentum going into even that excites us about our growth prospects several matters require a quick highlight as we look forward to margins weve been very successful on both sides of the balance sheet in keeping our pricing competitive and maintaining margin our rising yield curve will be beneficial to us over time ppp has been a significant contributor to our success both from a client service perspective as well as a financial perspective but thankfully it is heading to the rearview mirror replacing the financial impact of ppp is not easy but we are confident that we have the loan growth prospects to overcome the reduction in ppp revenues in credit has continued to outperform and given where our loan portfolio is currently positioned and the macro environment we believe we have reason to be optimistic for bhg grew by in we fully anticipate bhg to have another outstanding year of outperformance at a pace which should approximate annualized growth recruiting we fully anticipate another great year of building our core franchise through organic growth by recruiting the best bankers in our markets to our firm we will lean into our organic growth model even more in as we develop our end markets our specialty lending businesses and continue to build and grow market share of our legacy franchise pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 now bhg bhg had another great quarter and one that was better than we anticipated as they wrapped up a growth year another quarter of record originations was spread indiscernible through the pandemic on the gain on sale platform the bottomline chart details the almost banks in bhgs network and over individual banks acquired bhg loans last year coupled with the securitization success this continues to be one of if not the strongest lending platform for the gain on sale model in the country as to credit bhg has sold to their network of community and other banks just over billion in credit through their networks as noted the recourse obligation is reserved for potential future loss absorption bhg decreased recourse observed to approximately million at the end of the fourth quarter fourth quarter as a percentage of loan it was down by approximately basis points almost to precovid levels as noted on the chart at the bottom right the trailing losses landed at this chart splits the actual credit losses from losses bhg absorbs from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank pay to get the loan the increase for the prepayment loss is primarily attributable to the fact the actual premium paid for bhg credit has gotten larger consumer credit trends tend to have a higher prepayment track record and loans being paid off earlier as rates have decreased as shown in credit losses is very respectable in comparison to prior years as the losses are ph vintaged on the righthand chart losses continue to level out in earlier months as originations thus pointing to a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and remains much better than just from a few years ago bhg had another great operating quarter the fourth quarter and exceeded our expectations in the year produced outsized growth in relation to of were also revising our growth factors for down to approximately bhg believes that by investing more into the onbalance sheet model and creating a more predictable revenue stream should benefit the longterm franchise value creation of bhg originations as noted in the previous chart for approximated billion up meaningfully from bhg believes they will continue to grow originations in and have not reduced their target originations for this year roughly theyre looking at to of growth in originations they just decided to send more to the balance sheet they executed two securitizations in looking for another one here in the first quarter and i wouldnt be surprised if they dont execute three here in as the slide indicates theyve got more ideas that are in some stage have developed which if successful should bolster continued growth over the next several years bhg continues to review their business from both a critical perspective how can they perform better as well as a strategic perspective how can they exploit their strengths to grow the franchise their track record is impressive so wrapping up as the loan growth and loan pricing for pinnacle in it will take work but we are optimistic deposit growth has been remarkable it likely will slow as macro factors begin to reflect change deposit pricing continues to decrease but is nearing indiscernible our fee outlook is likely aggressive but we believe we have the horsepower in place to deliver outsized growth in lastly we will continue to incent our leadership based on top quartile performance and believe we have the momentum going into to do so with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 okay thank you harold we started this call with a look at our past performance over the last five years on our credit performance variables that we believe are required to grow shareholder value we believe our advantaged markets our longstanding model for attracting talent our remarkable ability to wow our clients and most importantly our willingness to spend the money necessary to see this extraordinary opportunity should yield best inclass growth and has positioned us for the continued share grab that should be available given the stressed client loyalty for our largest competitors i think anyone thats following our story for any length of time understands that our most important competency here is that we can attract many of the best bankers from the larger banks and enable and empower them to move their client base to pinnacle based on the distinctive service and advice that were able to offer ph were what frequently referred to as a goldilocks solution for great bankers were just right for the great bankers and larger banks that are frustrated by the bureaucracy and inability to serve their clients well were small enough to be nimble and responsive to make decisions close to the client yet big enough to meet the credit needs of even larger middle market clients and to provide sophisticated treasury management wealth management and the like was no exception we set a record for attracting and hiring experienced revenue producers away from those larger more vulnerable institutions in our market and honestly as harolds already indicated i expect that well set another record in in a number of our earnings calls ive tried to spent some time helping investors understand the power of our culture our differentiated model and i do that because without understanding that its nearly impossible to understand the pace and reliability of our growth on those key performance variables like eps revenue and tangible book value last quarter i used a similar chart to this one in order to demonstrate at the firmwide level the linkage between our obsession with the work environment to our obsession with wowing our clients to the creation of extraordinary shareholder value as a hope you know its our intent to continue to produce outsized growth so i thought this quarter ill spent a minute looking at our ability to grow and expand rapidly largely because of our culture not at the expense of our culture many of you will remember our announcement to acquire bnc which had operations across the carolinas and virginia at the time it looked to us to be a indiscernible acquisition with both tangible book value accretion and doubledigit eps accretion and it enabled us to extend some of the most attractive markets in southeast like charlotte and raleigh north carolina and charleston and greenville south carolina for those of you that were around ph the end you remember that we described the deal strategy as number one to hold on to the growing commercial real estate business as bnc was so good at while number two using our distinctive culture and our ci focus to bolton a large ci business in order to turbocharge the overall growth rate so this client intended to illustrate the power of our culture to indiscernible markets and produce higher growth it all begins with getting the associates fired up and engaged as you can see here in just four years later we won best place to work awards in charlotte in raleigh and in triad of north carolina and for the whole state of south carolina and according to greenwich weve had the highest net promoter score in north carolina so were able to leverage that obsession with associate engagement in order to create a distinctive client experience and then look at the loan growth particularly the ci growth the ph remixing of the deposit book based on growth in transaction and mmda accounts the fee income growth which has been turbocharged by the introduction of wealth management products indiscernible and our ability to hire revenue producers from some of the largest and best banks in those markets in fact we have been able to protect the indiscernible cre business that rick callicutt and his team have built while transforming the growth engine through the ci business i cant say enough about what rick and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 his team have accomplished and while thats past performance we expect the same cultural for us to produce outsized growth and our more recent market extensions like atlanta birmingham huntsville and washington dc so was a fabulous year for us our social engagement is measured through the top ph most ratings in our annual work environment survey actually increased in despite a very difficult year in terms of covid social unrest and so forth our net promoter scores reflected improvement in both tennessee and north carolina through our already strong client engagement again despite covid and all its ability to manage service quality most importantly again this year we produced top quartile total shareholder returns with underlying rapid growth in loans deposits fees eps and tangible book value weve invested meaningfully to position the firm to continue its rapid growth with the number of starts in atlanta now with associates in two offices and were in the process of building out the third office in ph north fulton county in that market were in birmingham huntsville and most recently in the washington dc and with all the investment in future growth we continue to balance that with an appropriate spending as evidenced by our noninterest expense to asset ratio just in which is just another indicator to me in addition to our sub efficiency ratio that were rightly investing in growth in terms of our execution priorities for this year harold has already given you the numbers but let me sort of give you whats behind it number one were continuing to invest meaningfully and exciting and engage in every single associate as you know we already have extraordinary associate engagement we have it not only across the entire associate base but across key minority segments including racial and gender minorities but that said nothing is more important to us than engage in every single associate such that they can give us their discretionary effort thats what accounts for the extraordinary performance that weve had over the last years but we believe we can do even better we have a number of initiatives specifically focused on diversity and inclusion during to ensure that were engaged in every single associate which is the fuel that drives this engine number two our second priority is a combined effort not only to drive up our service levels our net promoter scores if you will but to get paid for it somebody might say if you already have the second highest net promoter scores in the nation why would you listed as your number two priority to improve them and the reason is because in my opinion service has suffered dramatically almost universally universally in almost every industry many explain the service to management due to covid some blame supply chain issues in my opinion one excuse is as good as another so pinnacle will be doubling down on service quality we believe now is the time that we can capitalize on culture and produce even greater differentiation between us and our competitors and it is my belief that earning a premium based on the indiscernible service will be particularly critical in this elevating rate environment and in previous cycles deposit bases were generally indicative of the pace of earnings growth and so using our premium service to minimize the deposit bases as rates rise should enable us to widen our margins number three we think about seizing our market share along three dimensions number one continue to hire great bankers in our existing markets number two extend into new markets indiscernible bank of consequence as you know weve recently ph gained atlanta birmingham hospital in washington dc frankly id be surprised if we dont find our way to more of those kinds of opportunities in and then thirdly attract an industry specialist we use this approach to support our geographic market managers with a higher level of industry expertise and an ability to attract larger players that might prefer specialized knowledge versus local context weve recently added specialists in the area of equipment lending franchise lending and ph sovereign lending to name a few pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so as i mentioned earlier we expect all those previous actions to yield outside of growth and we expect to set another record in for recruiting and hiring revenue producers from our larger more vulnerable competitors for when harold reviewed our fee growth you saw that were currently producing outsized fee growth and a good number of fee categories like brokerage like trust like interchange and so forth thats what were talking about making sure we meet every need that our clients have we are specifically not product ph pushers but it is our desire to know our clients needs well that we meet them all which is a huge fee income opportunity thats already yielding outsized growth as youve seen which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future and then indiscernible of course even though our asset quality metrics are extremely strong nothing can indiscernible earning like credit losses and so as we grow the firm we continue to invest in credit infrastructure including senior credit officers credit analysts system support and so forth as you can probably tell im on fire but the opportunities that i see for our firm is on fire as ive ever been weve built a differentiated model which should continue to produce outsized share growth for an extended period of time and honestly the competitor vulnerability that currently exist should continue to expand in a consolidating industry thats just an accelerant for our growth the banks that have most of the market share in many of our markets also possess the greatest vulnerability so what could be better and so the question is how do we best see this opportunity number one continuity of senior leadership of course no one knows the future but i fully expect all the indiscernible three more years some more i believe some will stay longer for me indiscernible at least five more years we can evaluate after that over that period of time its my intent to put the board in the best possible position to optimize the shareholder value this firm is indiscernible by avoiding consolidation and its my intent to continue to work indiscernible develop the next generation of leaders for the firm it is best optimized by combining forces with another financial institution indiscernible one of the most valuable and attractive franchises around and the way we do that is to see this opportunity that ive tried to crystalize for you this morning to be all the dominant southeastern banking franchise operator well stop there and take questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jared shaw from wells fargo securities your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just a few things i guess on bhg a couple of questions harold you said the fee income growth to pinnacle in that range but can you reiterate what you think the originations of bhg could be did you say thats to growth off of 2021s level harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats right jared theyre thinking theyre going to still maintain the same kind of origination momentum going into that they thought theyve had now for the last few quarters what theyve decided to do is allocate more to balance sheet and build the balance sheet create them create a more sustainable revenue platform through interest income so they completed two securitizations in one in and they i think theyll complete two or three this year so and i think theyll be larger than what theyve completed in the past so they continue to be on a roll they continue to find new clients and so the business model itself is running really well and theyve also got these opportunities with these new call it verticals that theyre also exploring it well so were still as prompt as we can be about bhg and think theyll have another great year for us jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then when we look at that different or that the originations versus placements chart should we assuming that the placements are still you know call it around that million level that they are still going to keep that demand satisfied there with the growth coming beyond that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think they will continue kind of a similar ratio to what they did in the fourth quarter so as they scale out theyll manage their results towards that growth there pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess shifting to the broader loan growth terry you know that was great great data on the million of growth in the new markets you know when you add in dc like you said for and looking to see that expand do you think that the dc operation can ramp up maybe faster than that typical and i guess what did you say in the past takes about three years to get a book of business or do you think that that could ramp faster than what youve seen for other team hires m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i do for two reasons i think that the ph thrust there will have an even more commercial orientation than our other market extensions and so it takes less people to produce more loan volume than what would be difficult and so not only size and growth dynamics of the market but particularly the group of people that weve hired i mean you know my guess is that we could do somewhere between million and million in our first quarter out of the gate and so again indiscernible in the first quarter the momentum builds as you go we could do something really special there and you know indiscernible you didnt ask about it indiscernible but i might just comment on it indiscernible i think in round numbers they finished this year with about million in loan commitments about million in loan outstandings theyve got associates as i mentioned theyre going into their third office and so i mean i think its traveling really fast as well so i dont look for atlanta and dc to produce really outsized growth and then i always want to make sure people get it these markets that were in like charlotte and raleigh while the asset bases that we have there are meaningful to us theyre in that competitive market capacity what i expect to grow there just again i mentioned all hiring thats done and the movement towards the ci mix over there we expect charlotte and raleigh to really produce some extraordinary growth as well so anyway thats a little more ph gas but jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great color thanks and then i guess just ph finally you have i think with all the success youve had in hiring and how quickly theyre able to come in and all the benefits you talked about do you really even need to consider ma at this point in terms of indiscernible acquired to get into these markets or do you think youve you sort of cracked the code here and can just do hiring is the is really the sole way to expand the potential m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jared as you know i have worked hard to try to make sure people get it im not going to take the ma off the table because there could be a great transaction that id be willing to do but that said if you want my honest opinion youre on the right track its sort of like why would i go do some acquisition when you can produce kind of growth in atlanta and dc and birmingham and again i think well have other opportunities like those thats easily indiscernible jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for taking my questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i would like to start so to go back to bhg for a minute and the reduction the fee income growth of down to can you give us a little more context what drove their decision and maybe was it a change in the rate outlook and maybe that theyre expecting maybe that gain on sale margin to compress a bit harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think the rate outlook did have something to do with it but i really think that the ceo strongly believes that the onbalance sheet model will result in a greater franchise value for al so i think as he begins to look you know over the next two three or four years and we agree with al on that point as he looks over the next two or three or four years i think hes going to be extremely focused on how to build a franchise value of that firm and i think this is one of his kind of core beliefs he felt like going into that they were going to have a great year which they achieved they felt like that you know would get a spillover of that at a kind of clip but i think here over the last quarter or so he has reevaluated that that call it that allocation between balance sheet and gain on sale and just kind of moved it around a little bit i think is kind of the perspective that he shared with us steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thats helpful terry in terms of new hires so you guys hired revenue producers in and last quarter i thought you indicated you thought you might be for are you still in that range like how are you thinking and whats embedded in the expense guidance m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc ill say in terms of the hires i think well do more than that thats a reasonable range but i think well do more than that and again my optimism is really fueled by what is happening in atlanta talk about that a little bit honestly i believe they have three commitment letters for meaningful revenue producers that are signed and awaiting their balance before they come across and so again i expect to come out of the gate a little quicker in atlanta and i think the same thing will happen in dc so a little more optimistic view im not trying to take the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 guidance up meaningfully but i expect well hire more than what i previously said harold do you want to talk about how thats taken into account in the expense guide harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve loaded everything into the expense book for weve got less of a turnover factor ill say it that way so we expect our head count to increase more in than in the hiring just sheer hires we believe will increase i think the numbers like or steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and maybe final just drilling down a bit harold how much of the bump up i know its fairly modest but the bump up in expense outlook how much of that tied to this wage pressure that were hearing is basically everywhere thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ill we believe well first of all the standard rate for our firm was about i think we ended up close to with all the merit raises that are going into play this year so yes were feeling it but i dont think its going to derail this plan i think congratulations to the fed for realizing there is inflation though steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba from truist securities your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi there jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc harold you guys had strong sequential growth in service charges investment services trust fees are those fourth quarter run rate or are those good run rates going forward do you think in those areas and was there anything in particular driving that growth harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah we think well first of all theres likely some seasonality around interchange because of december but we dont think well see any significant pullback in any of those areas going into next year a lot of the wealth management is due to whats going on in overall or in the broader markets but i dont think theres any big pullbacks that were looking at going into the first quarter other than like i mentioned probably in the service charge and interchange areas where there is just probably less volume going into the first quarter jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc and jennifer if i could just say that youre getting extraordinary growth in these wealth management businesses particularly the brokerage business the trust business and so forth and so much of that are tied to this revenue producing thing that we talk about and try to be clear its not just relationship managers it is the wealth managers and brokers and those kinds of people and so we have hired a great number of those kinds of folks particularly in our carolinas markets and so thats really fueling a lot of that growth there jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc terry when can we expect pinnacle to enter the sunshine state harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc were already here m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i thought we were indiscernible m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i thought we were headquartered in indiscernible you know i dont know the answer to that and you know this we dont set targets saying hey ive got to get to this market by this day its all about the opportunity but i can i dont mind to say we banged around with some groups we ultimately decided we didnt think they were the right things for us and as you know they would have been good salespeople but we didnt believe they could build a consequential bank for us so anyway id just indicate that were interested in some of those markets and i would be indiscernible if we dont find our way there over the reasonably near future but again i dont have a specific date or a specific target to get there is just about when we find the right group jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for the question harold is that with your deposit growth its not too much different than many of the banks in the sector where its up roughly a third or so since covid started you kind of get out the telescope and think about deposit betas and such how should we start to think about the stickiness i guess for lack of a more technical term of those deposit balances as rates begin to move harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question brock weve been looking at growth in depositors particularly large deposit balances for quite some time trying to anticipate what could happen in an upright environment that said the relationship managers that we talked to about those depositors believe theyre sticky there will there are some there is some money in all of that where theyre waiting on an event to occur or something like that but that just happens in the day to day running of this bank so we believe theyre sticky as the ph datas and what were projecting were looking at somewhere in the numbers around that was similar to the last cycle to dependent on whether or not youre talking total deposits or interestbearing deposits but its were looking forward to that occurring were coaching the sales force on an operating environment now i think rob mccabe rick callicutt and rob garcia in atlanta theyre all getting ready for upright environments and talking to their call it their relationship managers that work with large depositors on how were going to respond to that so were just hopeful we believe that more sooner than later rate increase from the fed is going to be helpful to all of us brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and flipping over to the other side of the balance sheet and securities it i think it added million this quarter its been pretty steady it doesnt and i think you mentioned million for  it doesnt sound like youre likely to accelerate that just given that rates are up and you can earn more on that the book value focus seems to be playing into that i just want to make sure ive got that correct harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think youve got that correct well pick our spots if i had to say we had a target yield bogey with the bond book our new purchases is probably in the range maybe a little bit north of that with the same kind of products that weve customarily acquired so thats probably where were headed were likely to put some more work more money to work on the shorter end of the curve we got a couple of products that were looking at that we think were going to be able to execute on here in the first quarter and through the second quarter but like you might imagine they wont move the needle a lot brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for the questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of catherine mealor from kbw your line is now open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe just sticking with the balance sheet composition as a followup to brocks question so if we think about the maybe the size of the securities book it feels like were not going to see a big change ph from the of average earning assets today maybe up a little bit to to but ph my gut is that it stays kind of below of the balance sheet and then as a followon to that on the liquidity side as you think about this mid doubledigit growth in your gaap nii what kind of how much of deployment from this billion in cash are you assuming kind of goes away and is deployed into ph one of the securities books just trying to think of the kind of size of the balance sheet within that gaap nii guide harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah indiscernible right now we believe weve got about billion in cash thats just that we wish was deployed in a higher yielding asset but hasnt pulled the trigger on because of the way the rate market is responding currently so on and so forth i think youre accurate in your kind of range i dont think well were not going to execute any big ph gulp kind of strategy to divest or to reduce the liquidity profile into more longer term bond assets but we will monitor whats going on every day the 10years kind of spiked up not sure what its going to do today but it does make things more interesting we kind of like bonds that call them five seven eight years in maturity that we can get call it or more in yield if we can find those bonds then well tap into the market in a very measured and modest way but youre right theres not like any kind of ultimatum put on my group to say lets go push all these all this money out into the bond market thats not happening catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great so then really this billion in cash is going to be mostly going into the loan book so to your point in that its a multiyear effort maybe at the most billion of that is deployed kind of comes out this year just really depending on how deposit growth flows harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right and deposit growth is probably one of the more the biggest uncertainties as to what happens with the macro environment changing like its going to change and how all that flows down to banks like us pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then maybe a followup on your fee guide so to clarify is your high singledigit to low double digit fee guide inclusive of the bhg or exclusive of that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats inclusive so catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc including so total operating fees allin are up high singledigit to low doubledigit harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think bhg may move that number like basis points or something like that catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then one last just on bhg and you touched on this a little bit earlier but how does a higher rate environment impact the way bhg thinks about their indiscernible margins harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well they probably they would tell you that theyre not going to shrink but theyve widened throughout the pandemic so weve been in this low rate environment now for several years and spreads have widened so im not sure theyre going to get any wider when we get to an uprate environment so but where they might be like kind of spreads they might go to its not going to be a big change if rates move north quickly catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is now open pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co im just curious just maybe to continue on the bhg path there it looks like in the third quarter you guys put on about million on your own balance sheet of bhg loans and thats about million now in total so just kind of wondering what if you have the fourth quarter number or kind of how much is baked into the growth expectations for in terms of how much of that you guys will hold yourselves on balance sheet harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think were kind of in a million range in the fourth quarter and for the year i think our planning assumption is that were well be less in than call it around million to million stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats helpful and then the harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc indiscernible catherines question about spreads the one thing that i think is an advantage to bhg is the funding platform through that auction network for that spread to shrink the bhg loans have to compete with a more accelerating lending platform at some of these smaller call it community banks and so right now bhg represents to the smaller community banks an opportunity to grow their loan platform that they dont otherwise have so for spreads to shrink their loan growth outlook has to improve and it may improve but we dont think its going to improve significantly to a point that spreads are going to be impacted materially how about that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thats good color okay thanks and then maybe thinking about the interchange fees for a second i know you had some vendor incentives last quarter that maybe that was going to come out but then obviously you still had a big quarter here i guess im wondering was there anything unusual that led other than you mentioned the month of december being active but anything unusual that led that number higher and then weve seen with some of the larger regional banks the pushback on overdraft fees are you guys experiencing any of that at your size bank or do you think that will be a pressure point for you guys here in the quarters ahead harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont know of anything unusual in the fourth quarter interchange numbers were not feeling the pressure on overdrafts we had a lot of waivers during covid we pulled back on some of that postcovid and so we pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 believe were at somewhat of a standard run rate we monitor whats going on with the large caps and what theyre doing with overdraft waiver and so on and so forth well just have to see how all that plays out and how it works its way down to us over the coming quarters and years stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then maybe last thing for me im just kind of curious around asset sensitivity its increased modestly i guess over the last four quarters harold you noted the floors and that those have been a great benefit to you guys but is there anything you guys are thinking about strategically to increase the rate sensitivity more materially and then the deposit beta i think you mentioned in the presentation and overall why wouldnt it be lower this cycle given all the liquidity we have can you kind of give me your thoughts there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah that would be absolutely where were headed and thats what brings in this whole coaching thing that rob and rob and rick are doing with their sales force and getting them prepared for a rising rate environment so we hope we can beat the betas that weve kind of set out there and believe we have a great opportunity to do it precisely because we have the liquidity out in the system and so does everybody else so i dont think from the large caps and the midcaps youll see a significant boost in deposit rates from right out of the gate so we will try to manage that accordingly as to boosting asset sensitivity kind of here in the nearterm i think its going to be through our loan book i think loan funding has traditionally come to us with a heavier weight on floating rate assets i think well still have some deposit gathering going on here thatll likely go into cash so i think weve got a great opportunity here in the nearterm to still boost our asset sensitivity levels by some amount that said over the longterm i think its important to get on the table our goal is to be neutral with some bias one way or the other based on what we think the nearterm prospects are but we will not bet heavily one way or the other with our balance sheet stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thanks for all the color and congrats on another great year guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael rose from raymond james your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions just wanted to go back to bhg again another big recourse reserve release this quarter i think you had said on the last call that you expected it to end the year around youre at they talked about getting down to to this year any updates there and then if you can comment on the expense trajectory there because it did look like another big ramp in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 expense growth there and just maybe if that incorporates any new verticals that were talked about at the investor day thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think there is probably some room more room in recourse reserve release here in im not sure if theyll tap into it but i think that number is still kind of reasonable i dont know if itll get that low but thats kind of what their current thoughts are their expense growth they are adding quite a bit of head count with particularly in their analytical groups they believe thats kind of the what drives the engine so they are seeing quite a bit of that as well but we still believe at the end of the day were looking at growth for us michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just back to market expansions you guys have had a very successful track record i have no doubt that you will be successful in the dc market as well florida was brought up earlier but as you look throughout the southeast and then the southwest texas is obviously a market that would seem to kind of fit the profile that you guys have historically sought would that be an option at some point and maybe if you can just remind us on where the geographic limitations might be in the kind of the short to intermediate term thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think on what our geographic thrust is we call it the southeast basically what were trying to say is memphis draw a line up to dc and down to the southern tip of florida thats sort of the target again we have we now have the ph sec participants from texas so i guess somebody might call texas a southeastern state but right now our thrust is there candidly the reason that our thrust is there is we know the bankers and the bankers that weve hired are bankers in those markets and thats really what we do is try to cultivate our known bankers we know less in texas and therefore the opportunities are smaller for us i think youre on the right point it wouldnt surprise me if we draw the map at some point to include texas but right now the opportunities are so rich in the southeastern markets thats our first preference michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right well maybe at some point harold can stir up the la office too as you guys ph grow it thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david bishop from seaport research your line is now open pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 david j bishop q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning gentlemen m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning david j bishop q analyst seaport research partners hey a quick question terry and harold noticed the nice improvement nice growth on the ci commercial and industrial segment there just curious maybe what youre seeing and hearing on that front are you seeing any sort of better line utilization up there and obviously the omicron virus has dominated the news but i noted the narrative in terms of the credit costs it sounds like youre expecting a further reduction in the allowance here is that sort of informing your view on the positive economic outlook thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think in terms of ci loan demand i honestly believe ci loan demand is fairly tepid we dont see a meaningful increase in line utilization at this point and i think again we deal with ownermanaged businesses lower midmarket businesses i think a lot of people are just sort of looking at the landscape saying boy there are a lot of unknowns here and typically they dont do a lot of borrowing when there are so many unknowns so i think if we can get a more solid footing for both the economy and the political landscape and all those kind of things that influence optimism among business owners that will be helpful and additive and produce greater loan demand but i do think ci loan demand is not very strong the growth that we achieve there i think is largely dependent on our hiring model and the number of new hires that weve made and moving their books of business and so forth david j bishop q analyst seaport research partners got it and then just maybe a followup on the asset sensitivity and net interest margin i think last quarter you said the core nim outlook a little lower in the nearterm not materially down flat to a few basis points which came to fruition this quarter ph i think it was down basis point looking in your crystal ball and just first quarter what are you thinking now in terms of the core margin direction harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well still experience some dilution in our margins but again i dont think its going to be a big thing i think itll come down maybe a few basis points but nothing significant david j bishop q analyst seaport research partners got it thank you pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian martin from janney montgomery your line is now open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions the hey harold maybe just one followup on the last question on margin with regard to your guide and nii the core margin like in your outlook when you kind of look at the core margin what do you consider the core margin today i guess knowing with the liquidity levels ppp im just wondering what you pull out of there when youre thinking about the core margin harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think youre right thats a valid question but ph were still analyzing the impact of this liquidity build it has very little impact on net interest income but a meaningful impact on net interest margin so i think its important to understand that as to the ppp program we think the ppp program is effectively in the rearview mirror and so itll be less impactful for sure well have to probably keep looking at it as well for comparison purposes to the last couple of years and as far as discount accretion on mergers that number has come down quite a bit and so the gaap margin and our core margin the biggest difference is basically going to be with respect to the liquidity and that number
