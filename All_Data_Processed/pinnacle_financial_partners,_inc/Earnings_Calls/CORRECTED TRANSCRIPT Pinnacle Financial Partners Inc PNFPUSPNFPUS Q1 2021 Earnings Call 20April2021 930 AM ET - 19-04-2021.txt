turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator and thank you for joining us this morning  was an outstanding quarter in my view most of you whove been following us know that during the pandemic we transitioned quickly to defense beginning last january we believe that not only to shore up asset quality but we launched a number of initiatives that would continue to drive ppnr through and put us in a position to accelerate as the impact of the pandemic wanes and so in  we were able to get off to a really fast start and recognized some of that ppnr growth we begin every quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our key performance metrics on a gaap basis but as we most always do because there are so many adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that were truly managing here at pinnacle ill move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted nongaap measures part of our first quarter earnings call last april i told you that my expectation was in the final analysis wouldnt be about 2020s earnings but more about how well we position our firm to return to our previous pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 earnings trajectory following the pandemic and as you can see here on the top row the trajectories are all slopping up into the right with total revenues fully diluted eps and adjusted ppnr all up meaningfully on a linkedquarter annualized basis revenues were up roughly annualized during the first quarter adjusted eps was up annualized during the first quarter and adjusted ppnr during the first quarter is up annualized along the second row you can see that loans are up annualized during the first quarter inclusive of ppp harold will review in greater detail shortly and talk about expectations going forward but generally excluding ppp we continue to believe well produce loan growth primarily based on our ability to take market share due to our prolific hiring weve hired revenue producers in in the first quarter of and thats more than of our total revenue producers that represents enormous market share movement potential which i expect differentiates our growth opportunity for many if not most of our peers core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace during the first quarter and in spite of the covid challenges we continue to have a track record for consistently growing tangible book value per share with growth in tangible book value per share yearoveryear across the bottom row you can see that asset quality held up really well in the first quarter with npas of just basis points thats the lowest level in the last decade classified assets also down this quarter to the lowest level in the last decade and annualized net chargeoffs of just basis points in the quarter im going to turn it over to harold and tim to review the results in much greater detail as we go through the details i find theres a lot to be encouraged about as it relates to revenue growth first of all regarding our net interest margin fundamentals particularly the trajectory of our cost of deposits and secondly fee income mortgage originations and sales continue to run at a record pace bhg continued to accelerate during this pandemic and again in the first quarter continues to outperform expectations we talked about our transition to defense earlier in allocating a meaningful part of our human capital to reviewing our loan book borrowerbyborrower tims going to update you on the work that he and his team accomplished here in  as well as give you insights of what were seeing and learning from our clients particularly in these stressed segments at least for me our asset quality performance continues to inspire optimism so harold let me turn it over to you harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody many of my slides i have shown for quite some time so im going to hit the high points we are pleased with our first quarter loan growth excluding ppp average loans were up annualized between the first quarter and fourth quarter excluding ppp endofperiod loans at march compared to december were up annualized so call it a midsingledigit growth quarter as to loan yields in spite of the steepening yield curve and as we mentioned last time loan yields will be a fight in we will lean into our relationships even harder to maintain our yields theres a lot of equity out there it sure feels like its a borrowers market right now our indiscernible credits only saw a slight decrease in yields while libor was down basis points and fixed rates down basis points overall loan rates were down basis points with ppp loans being down pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 and the biggest contributor to overall loan yield decline and likely to be the most difficult to model over the next few quarters but more on that in a second so where to from here our market leaders continue to believe that our endofperiod loan growth forecast excluding ppp in the highsingle digits for is a reasonable number for our firm we built that estimate from the ground up based on continual dialogue with our frontline lenders as always we will lean on our new hires to take it to give us an advantage on loan growth coupled with our markets which we believe to be the best banking markets with the best bankers in the southeast were optimistic about our loan growth goals for as to yields we still have about of our floating variable rate loan book on inthemoney floor so that will help shield some of the pain should loan rates continue to be under pressure hopefully we can get some traction from a steepening yield curve over time speaking of ppp and the tons of work thats been accomplished here weve funded around billion between the two programs and the program were just over million in fundings about where we thought wed end up new application volume is slowing so we dont anticipate a great deal more heres what were hearing and im definitely not on the frontline but it seems to ph rain through the program hit the mark and was primarily used to help smaller businesses at least from our perspective the process has improved since last year and this has made life somewhat easier for us and our clients the fda continues to move around change the rules but all in all its in a better spot no one is casting stones as we cant imagine what the sba had to deal with over the last year to get these programs up and running as to forgiveness smaller clients are getting done say loans less than while loans say greater than million appear to be on the sba backburn and have been for quite some time during the quarter a slow for some technical issues that the sba was dealing with and then we ran into tax season with a lot of clients working with their cpa our thoughts are that eventually substantially all of our clients who have not repaid their loans will seek forgiveness not sure whether another round of ppp will come around but if it does we will dive in and believe the appetite will be there but it will be limited as for our ppp results for the second quarter were modeling a decrease in total revenues somewhat consistent to the decrease between the fourth and first quarter it all depends on the pace of forgiveness eventually the sba will get at the greater than million loan so that is coming to us we just dont know when we have about million in loans awaiting forgiveness with the sba currently and approximately million where we are working with clients to gather necessary data to submit to the sba for approval now onto deposits we had another big deposit quarter core deposits were up almost billion in the first quarter weve experienced significant growth in noninterestbearing deposits ending up at billion at quarter end up since last year obviously we believe a significant part of that is government stimulus our average loans to average deposit ratio was down only basis points to so we consider that a small victory our average deposit rates were basis points while eop deposit rates were at basis points so we continue to see downward momentum for and look to be around basis points by the fourth quarter of assuming our shortterm rate forecast remained consistent for the remainder of this year liquidity builds for nearly all banks is gaining more attention the steepening of the yield curve has gotten our attention but we remain neutral on any sort of big bond deployment strategy at present our securities to assets ratio has been to for a long time our estimates are that our peers were running slightly more than that in the to range we may deploy a modest amount of liquidity into bonds over the next few quarters but it will be months pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 we also allocated about million late in the first quarter into a repo instrument which is secured by a counterpartys investment securities portfolio this is a floating rate instrument that yields around basis points currently so itll be more impactful in the second quarter were looking at a somewhat similar product currently but it wont be as large i mentioned all of this to let you know we are actively looking at prudent investments where we can minimize or eliminate credit risk while creating some earnings momentum as the top chart indicates we will again have an opportunity to reduce our wholesale funding book in the second quarter which we fully anticipate this almost billion reduction is in our broker deposit books which we acquired as part of our intentional liquidity build last year at the onset of the pandemic this reduction should help reduce deposit costs and help our nim slightly on the go forward additionally we have about million in federal home loan bank borrowings but the prepayment penalty remains such that the payback period on those is still four to five years so we will hold tight for now but monitor those borrowings continue we believe our nim after ppp and liquidity was approximately in the same quarter which compares to a similar calculation last quarter of thus our adjusted nim is now up four quarters in a row also our gaap nim is now up three quarters in a row we anticipate flat to up slightly for the rest of the year ppp forgiveness will have a lot to do with that now to fee income ill be brief fees were million for the quarter for the quarter fee revenues were more than over the first quarter number of last year wealth management had a great quarter in comparison to last year we continue to be very active on the hiring front across our franchise particularly as we continue to build wealth management in the carolinas and atlanta mortgage beat our expectations by a mile posting revenues of million for the quarter up million from last quarter second quarter is looking strong as well as we sit here today we are much more optimistic about mortgage origination in than we were three months ago as the right market does not appear to be moving away from us as quickly as we anticipated it might our markets remain strong and we have hired several key originators in several of our markets over the last few quarters ill talk more about bhg in a minute but bhg continues to issue great report cards quarterafterquarter as to expenses specifically incentives i think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive costs to our expense base and if our earnings were hitting our targets then incentive costs go up if not they go down was very much a downer at least in terms of incentives for our associates but we fully anticipate based on the current operating environment that will come back strong and hopefully our associates will recoup some of that lost incentive from we have provided an opportunity this year to our associates to earn an outsized incentive that said theres no free lunch increased incentives only occur if our earnings growth supports the incentive last year provision expense and cecl required an outsized reserve build which directly impacted our incentive plans probably more so than most it only stands to reason that if were able to recoup some of that prior year reserve build this year then some of that should find its way to our associates this year our annual cash incentive is tied to the usual ph salaries and earnings growth numbers we also maintain the ppnr component which we added during the middle of pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 additionally our board has also changed the way equity compensation works for the leadership of the firm rather than achieving absolute goals for our performancebased equity awards our indiscernible will be based on how we rank within a peer group specifically targeting rotce and tangible book value growth over a threeyear period along with a modifier based on total shareholder return that change we believe is more shareholderfriendly over the long term i probably have spent too much time on incentives but those of you that have been around for a while you know our unique incentive culture incentive structure is cultural and it is definitely part of what drives the heartbeat of our firm for both the annual cash and equity incentive plans the first quarter would indicate were trending in the right direction as to expense run rate were anticipating personnel expense with all of our new hires coming on board and inclusive of our increased incentives personnel expense should increase between to each quarter for the remainder of the year conversely all of our other nonpersonnel costs which amounted to slightly more than million last year should see that highsingledigit percentage decrease thats right a decrease in as i stated before the leadership of our firm is determined to not let a trend develop with a less than target paid out to our associates thats a trend we will work hard to avoid in but to accomplish that we all are looking forward to meeting and exceeding our financial objectives this year quickly some comments on capital ill be brief we raised our dividend to a share last quarter with the share price where it is weve not acquired any shares and we dont anticipate buying any in the near term weve been working to redeem a couple of sub debt issuances this year and as i mentioned previously weve intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a component for it in our leaderships equity compensation plans as to our outlook ph and i wont go through this slide in depth as we have covered most of this previously so this is really a summary for the model builders out there of what we think obviously we realize that we appear more optimistic than most that said we have great confidence in our people our markets and our clients and renewed optimism about where the pinnacle is headed now bhg these slides that weve shown for several quarters the blue bars on the chart are originations and we have ramped up with more loans being funded with records being set nearly every quarter for the past three quarters first quarter was a record for both originations and placements the green bar represents loans from which gainonsale has been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream banks this is the traditional bhg model with gainonsale revenues being generated coupons have fluctuated somewhat over the last three years ending at for the first quarter as to bank buy rate they fell to in the first quarter so net spreads remain in the mid which over time is up from previous years the bottom right chart now over banks in bhg network and almost individual banks acquired bhg loans last year this has to be one of the strongest funding platforms for a gainonsale model in the country this slide is probably the best slide that demonstrates the growth potential of bhgs model indiscernible have improved significantly over the last two years and it is resulting in better hit rates and more loans meeting our credit standards as to credit weve updated the bhgs chargeoffs and reserve build chart these are for loans that bhg has sold to their network of community banks the green bar shows that currently they have just under billion in credit pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 with banks who have acquired bhg loan the orange line details the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks trailing first quarter losses landed at basically consistent with the last few years and during the year where who knew how covid would impact loss rates the risk the recourse obligation reserve is used to reserve for future losses for the loans sold to other banks with covid they increased the reserves by approximately ph million in the first quarter but as a percentage of loans it was down slightly the top left chart weve shown on several occasions the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily in the past and over the last few years bhg continues to refine their scorecards and increased the quality of its borrowing base again the right chart and as ive said before may be the most powerful chart i have to offer related to bhgs steadily improving credit quality looking at losses by vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination thus pointing toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans pandemicrelated events may cause these losses to move upward but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much better than just from a few years ago lastly we said in last quarter and well say it again was a big year for bhg and we anticipate big things in last year bhg executed on their first million securitization this allowed bhg to continue to diversify its revenues and its funding sources were expecting another similar securitization at bhg in the near future here in the second quarter of bhgs earnings continue to ramp up bhg had a great operating quarter in the first quarter very much exceeded everyones expectations even theirs weve upped our expectations for quarterly now expecting to produce outsized growth in relation to of to or more before we had anticipated highsingledigit growth so wrapping up loan growth and loan pricing for pinnacle in will take work but we are optimistic deposit growth has been remarkable deposit pricing is headed down nim should be flat to up bhg had another great quarter and we continue to believe in them personnel costs will go up but correlated to increased earnings credit for both pinnacle and bhg we believe is in very much great shape so with that ill turn it over to tim to talk more about growth timothy h huestis chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold good morning everyone using the traditional credit metrics of net chargeoffs npas classified assets and past due accruing loans pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well in the first quarter as in prior quarters during covid our bankers and credit teams continued their thorough client credit reviews particular emphasis was placed on nonpass credit our hotel portfolio and credits in our covidspecific lowpass risk grade our first quarter credit metrics are very encouraging our classified assets decreased again this quarter dropping by million and our classified asset ratio declined to a very modest npas also decreased this quarter down to just basis points and finally criticized loans decreased during the quarter by million similar to prior quarters in we conducted a fourquestion survey during march of ci clients with loan balances totaling million the survey was specifically targeted to our lowpass risk grade clients in a wide variety of segments such as entertainment restaurants consumer services and healthcare the questions inquired about revenue projections for the current quarter compared to the same period last year and months of liquidity the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 survey results report a more optimism than our fourth quarter survey responses that we previously shared with you of particular note versus in december said first quarter revenue should be between and of first quarter versus in december have seven months of liquidity or greater this slide is to provide an update on pinnacles loans that were modified under section of the cares act our section modifications were negotiated with borrowers from the perspective of providing the client a longerterm solution to help them bridge to the other side of covid our approach was to improve pinnacles position and simultaneously help the client with each modification we collected very current borrower information as we sought to accurately rerisk grade the loan and to contemplate the terms of our modification a key distinction between deferrals offered first and second quarter of and these modifications executed in third and fourth quarter is the vast majority of our clients with section modifications or at a minimum paying interest monthly with each section modification for our hotel loans was negotiated to fit the borrowers specific circumstance our modifications generally consisted of changing the loan repayment terms to interest only for three to months in consideration for borrower concessions such as pay the accrued interest that accumulated during the earlier deferral period establish an interest reserve on deposit with pinnacle and shorten the loan maturity as illustrated in our supplemental deck pinnacles hotel book has held up of particular note our hotel portfolio occupancy has been stronger than the national average as reported by str for eight of the last nine months as an example our average occupancy for the month of february was versus the national average at that time of on a very positive note str reported for the week ended april national hotel occupancy was this is the highest level in the past months given that of our hotel loans are in the economy limited service or extended stay segments we believe this improving occupancy trend bodes well for our portfolio many of our hotel clients in these particular segments can cover operating expenses and interest when occupancy is in the mid40 range as a testament to our conservative hotel underwriting prior to covid we only have four loans totaling million that are rated classified with the american rescue plan the deadline for banks to complete section modifications was extended from december to january as this table illustrates weve had very little change in our section loan modifications after the original deadline this next slide is to provide a brief overview of our different credit delivery channels while the structure of our different channels may not appear unique we believe it is our model of hiring experienced bankers in combination with the design of pinnacles loan underwriting channels that drives our results several of our key tenants that help us play offense during the good times and also execute defense very effectively include for ci and cre loan request greater than million we have credit teams in market working directly with our financial advisor the credit teams have historically joined the banker on prospect or client calls for loans greater than million we do not use remote centralized credit factories or hubs as many of our regional competitors do at pinnacle our fas partner and collaborate with credit very early in the loan request we believe this practice of quickly involving credit on loan requests is different than our competitors average years of experience for our senior credit officers is years and the average years of experience for our credit analysts is years we believe our credit teams experience level has served us well in converting prospects to customers and serving our clients pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 and our special assets team is led by a 40year industry veteran his team of special assets advisors average years of work at experience pinnacles financial advisors are encouraged to raise their hand early with any loan exhibiting early signs of distress our culture of involving our special assets experts early has been a key driver in the positive trend in our classified assets and npas pinnacles credit metrics have held up well although we have shifted back to an offensive stance we will continue our thorough defensive work on clients in the impacted segments and in particular our hospitality book and now terry ill hand it back over to you m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thanks tim on the one hand i think its too early to spike the football as it relates to covid but it seems apparent to me that as a result of the progress on the vaccines along with all the stimulus has been poured into the economy were setting up for a strong second half of and as weve said many number of times its been our intent since last january to get a position to seize those opportunities that would inevitably exist in the southeast as the economy begins to reignite as i mentioned in my introductory comments in my view first quarter was an outstanding quarter with npas of basis points classified assets down to past dues down to just basis points asset quality actually appears excellent and many of the threats we once feared seem to have subsided adjusted eps was up over the same quarter last year importantly adjusted ppnr was up over the same quarter last year and revenues were up roughly over the same quarter last year and now at a time when both fintech and asset generators are garnering enormous multiples we believe that bhgs validated the power of their differentiated model as they continue to originate and sell record volumes of loans through their proprietary auction platform as harold mentioned we expect that theyll do another securitization in  and as harold also has already mentioned even with the securitization theyre now forecasting income growth of to this year and so we believe all this sets up for a great building on that foundation and momentum as we move through the remainder of were extremely bullish on our organic growth opportunities coming out of the pandemic greenwich associates has estimated based on their market research among business owners that roughly of the revenues to banks is in motion there is a high level of dissatisfaction with large banks responsiveness during covid contributing factors including handling the payment deferrals early on then ppp and then certainly loan request also based on business owner feedback greenwich has developed a crisis response index which ranks banks based on their response to the crisis by aggregating how clients write them on the most important criteria during the pandemic not surprisingly in their fourth quarter data pinnacle is one of the highest rated banks in the nation naming that were one of the best positioned banks in the country to capitalize on this money in motion is of revenues available to the industry based on client dissatisfaction beyond that were one of the most attractive banks to work for in the country we were just listed again in fortune magazine as one of the top places to work in the country one of the limited number of banks on the list and that reputation is that it has enabled us to hire a record number of revenue producers in another record in and as the first quarter predicted we should track another record number of revenue producers in which would suggest outsized organic growth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 and perhaps most importantly were located in markets with some of the ph bestsized growth dynamics in the country nashville continued to create jobs which will further accelerate its growth most recently with its announcement of oracles expansion international jobs in billion capital investment also recent announcements by the partnership with gm and lg on a billion investment build a battery plant here in middle tennessee with jobs similarly raleigh recently announced that north americas largest endto end biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility will be located in wake county and create more than jobs and google will bring in an engineering hub with its many probably as many as jobs that add in all other successes in the triangle and of course atlanta continues to be the land of milk and honey georgia was recently named the top state to do business for the seventh consecutive year and im not exaggerating the metro atlanta chambers list of meaningful relocations and expansions for is a sevenpage document its unbelievable and finally ive already alluded to the importance we place on being in the largest and fastest growing markets in the southeast in the past weve published maps of the southeast exflorida to demonstrate our target markets and we filled out the majority of those markets with the acquisition of bnc in and de novo start in atlanta at this point i cant name a franchise with a more attractive footprint or thats better situated going forward i think the best illustration of our target markets is simply a list of the largest and fastest growing msas in the southeast now including florida were satisfied and believe that weve adequately demonstrated that our distinctive model is universally effective in the southeast and as weve already pointed out we believe theres great vulnerability in the large banks who dominate these markets i would say were seeing unprecedented opportunities to enter those markets in a few cases with potential strategic combinations but in many cases on a de novo basis which we like a lot our firm has almost always been a highgrowth financial services firm going forward we see extraordinary vulnerability at the large banks that dominate many of our markets we expect to attract best bankers in both our existing and potentially attractive markets around the southeast we love the size and growth profile of the markets that are in our existing footprint we expect to have opportunities to expand into other attractive southeastern markets so again i think we are excited about the potential growth both short and long term operator im going to stop there and well be glad to open the floor for questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and our first question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody maybe if we start with bhg i mean thats great trends that youre seeing there and with the securitization are they doing that just really to keep that avenue open or should we expect as we go through the year that securitizations will be a bigger part of that and i guess how big could the balance sheet at bhg get or how big would they be comfortable with that getting versus selling them harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think theyre pretty confident with growing their balance sheet they will have a securitization accomplished here in the second quarter and we would not be surprised to see they will accomplish another one before the end of this year so theyve not gone away from that diversification strategy jared so we fully anticipate them to grow it they think they can get their balance sheet up meaningfully here over the next couple or three years jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then with that revenue coming in and then terrys comments about the opportunities in these other markets including florida is there an opportunity for you all to be dramatically increasing the hiring pace of revenue producers in some of these new markets and can you take this as an opportunity to really expand that atlanta model into other markets and if so is that included in your expense outlook or would that be additional as those opportunities come up harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well ill talk about the expense outlook and whats in it and whats not in it and let terry go into the hiring plan for the rest of this year in other markets we do include a kind of call it a placeholder for new revenue hires for the rest of the year traditionally i think wed call that de minimis so that every market leader has at least some room in their plan for new hires but its in no way shape or form kind of the target that were looking for out of these market leaders and what we expect from them in these markets does that make sense jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah so if theres a bigger opportunity then that would not be reflected in the budget at this point harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right if they get outsized hiring going on well fully support that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared i guess i would add to harolds comments i do believe that we are likely to have incremental opportunities in markets that were not currently in we do have i think we do have great reputation and as you know theres a fair amount of turmoil around the southeast with some of the bigger companies and we found that we have people contacting us from various markets that are interested in coming and moving the team and so forth and so we continue to evaluate those opportunities and get those opportunities and so forth but i do believe that were very likely to have incremental hiring opportunities in markets that were not currently in jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just finally for me i guess can you give an update on how the new hires that have been brought on over the last months or so how are they doing in terms of actual production versus the goal and obviously covid threw everyone for a loop but are they getting traction are they able to start chopping some wood on that of bank revenue thats in motion right now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think so jared what we do is we track kind of our revenue producers based on how long theyve been with us and obviously the ones that have been here the longest are the ones that are producing most of the continual revenues for us but we track them based on tenures of one year three years five years and then more than five years and the newer i guess ill call them hirees are coming up the ranks were pleased with that and we fully anticipate that they will be the ones that give us the momentum we need here over the next couple of years as terry mentioned i think its something like to of our revenue producers have been hired during the last couple of years we think thats an incredible opportunity for us here in the near term m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jared again ill add to harolds comments i think your question is on the right track covid does impact and i would say it this way it lengthens the sales cycle both in terms of our ability to recruit people as well as their ability to recruit their clients to the firm so it does lengthen in covid where its just more difficult to get in front of clients and those kinds of things but that said as harold mentioned we are tracking and we are seeing the progress grow and we do believe that based on what the pipelines are building that theyll be able to deliver and as you say get traction on this of the share thats in motion jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess just that then when you look at your loan optimism overall though is it a combination of being driven by new clients or better utilization or sort of equally both m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think it is about we see increased line of credit draw thats helpful but we also see an extraordinarily high level of paydowns in commercial real estate so they sort of balance each other and so when you work your way down to the net growth i think the biggest factor in our ability to produce that will be these new hires ability to move that market share pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator and thank you and our next question comes from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone howre you doing m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good howre you doing steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co doing well thank you and i apologize if i missed the first couple of questions there but i guess one of my questions for you terry just longerterm as you think about bhg and obviously i know theres a lot of unknowns and if that ever creates a liquidation event but how do you guys think about capital priorities if and when that were to occur and maybe specifically around ma given you probably do have that advantage currency you have kind of sought in terms of ma over time i think youre at about tangible versus your peers at times tangible today so kind of just wondering how you think about that capital deployment and opportunity set there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think as ive sort of alluded to in the prepared remarks there it is obvious our stock is advantaged i do think theres ma opportunity that seems to be picking up again not such a wild stream of announcements but it seems to me there are lots of theres lot of dialogue going on and so we continue to evaluate ma opportunities really across the front and so anyway i think you know this steve and i think going back to last year somebody asked about ma and my response was what i mean i wouldnt spend my currency trading slightly above tangible book value but its ph that is a different equation and so we look to optimize both the opportunity and the advantage of the stock and so anyway i guess id just characterize it that way i dont want to overplay it or overbill it or oversell it as you know there are thousands of circumstances that come together make it work but certainly were in a different position than we would have been even six months ago as it relates to ma i think on the as it relates to bhg it is just so hard to if we get to ask questions a lot about what would you do with this what would you do with that i mean theres so many circumstances that are unknown what would the valuation be what how much might be sold how much there are just right ways variables that would influence what choice we make when we get there but i would say this its a really luxurious problem to having in a position with so much money interested in what they do so anyway right we just have to cross that bridge when we get there stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 yeah yeah definitely a high class problem i suppose its been a great investment does it make you want to think about other nonbank acquisitions i guess moving forward or is that something youre exploring more than just the traditional bank deals whether that be fintechtype investments i know youve done some of already or other line of business type acquisitions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think i would say that we hire and we continue to look at sort of alternative kinds of investments like bhg i think youre aware advocate capital which is its a smaller scale deal but its a meaningful deal weve got a small investment in our blazing gun weve got some our approach on these things is generally using indiscernible when you fire bullets indiscernible involved as you know and so we do like that theyre found in both fintech and asset generators that same differentiated and so you dont expect us to continue to look in that vein its not exactly like looking for a unicorn but its also they are not just everywhere so it takes a little more there might be a little more serendipity in that i think but certainly were interested in those kinds of things i think on the lines of business im not saying there arent any but i say less of those just to be candid weve got a pretty well fully builtout of product capability and when you look at some of these things that we would have an interesting line take pc insurance or something like that i mean when you get down to brass tacks of it you got all this rollup going on people buying extraordinary multiples and it creates too much goodwill for us i mean when you get into some of those sort of wealth management lines are really hard to acquire and feel like youre going to either make a good deal or youre going to be able to retain the revenues many of those things are personality and so forth so i would be less excited about lots of business than i am about bank ma or other sort of fintech asset generators stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful and then maybe just last thing for me i might need you to stop talking about atlanta so much because theres people everywhere here and the traffic bad again so you cant highlight it too much but im wondering kind of where you are on the progress front there in terms of how many lenders you have on the team now maybe the base of loans and then i know you mentioned specifically wealth management for atlanta and north carolina and is that just building out the teams or is there a specific opportunity around wealth management in those environments that youre really seeing thats leading you to push into that space in particular m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think again david i would characterize honestly i would characterize our opportunities in some of these north carolina markets specifically charlotte and raleigh are really similar to atlanta again of course atlanta is the biggest and most vibrant but those other two markets are really handsome markets and we have such small chair positions that we sort of look at those much like we would the de novo start in atlanta i think the hiring has generally been pretty even i cant recite the numbers in each of those markets but were hiring revenue producers in each of those markets both of which you might call traditional financial advisors or relationship managers as well as the rest of the revenueproducing categories like mortgage originators brokers and trust administrators i think you asked about the opportunity i do think that the large banks that weve been working on to hire relationship managers from have really high vulnerability in some of these wealth management pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 businesses trust administrators portfolio managers brokers and so forth and so thats really the opportunity that were trying to seize for the other revenue producers stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense thanks for the time and congrats on a great quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator thank you and our next question comes from brock vandervliet from ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc on bhg just to confirm so thats a to net income growth guide for this year is that right harold harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes or more brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and wheres that growth coming from a couple of quarters ago you had a lot of disclosure about new verticals is that been kind of sidestepped and this is all the traditional more traditional growth areas or is it new verticals too harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think theres a list of things that they because we asked them the same question i think the gainonsale model is operating at pretty much peak efficiency theyve got a better data theyre able to go out and send out more opportunities to do business with people so on and so forth i think their resolution of substituting loans is better than they anticipated post covid so theyve got some break there i think with the improved credit outlook youre likely to see some reduction in reserves for losses i dont think itll be like a big kind of cliff thing but i think itll be steady for the rest of the year so i think when you put all that into the blender theyre coming out thinking this year is going to be a great year for them and so thats how we got to the or more brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and shifting over to the funding side i believe relative to our model part of this was just the reduction in some of your wholesale deposits but it did kind of stand out to me as youre showing a decline in the rate of deposit growth it seems could you speak to that are you seeing any peaking there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 well we hope were seeing some peaking there but i cant really give you any kind of comfort that were going to see core deposit growth lessen were active in several different initiatives to kind of grow lower cost smaller account balance deposits but we will see more runoff in the wholesale book weve got like a like we mentioned we got billion coming out this quarter but hopefully that will be enough so that we dont grow the funding book like we did here in the first quarter brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone i wanted to m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the loan outlook i appreciate the improved optimism on loan growth but given the industry is up to its eyeballs on liquidity particularly your larger competitors can you talk about the competitive environment today for lending and could that impact your ability to get that highsingledigit growth m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question i think harold alluded to in his comments the fact that it sort of feels like a borrowers market theres a handful of reasons for that but clearly one of them is limited loan demand which drives pricing lower and those kinds of things so what your own is a correct theme and right theme i believe we believe that we have taken that into account in our forecast nobody knows the future i guess but what we believe is that if you just sort of look at the loan demand in our footprint if you will economic loan demand is still very low we expect it will pick up in the latter half of the year but it will be muted by all the liquidity in the system and so where we believe we get the growth is from really incremental hires moved in market share from where they were to us and so thats the principal assumption about where the growth comes from its less dependent upon economic loan demand than it is market share movement steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then if we look at the covid19 impacted segments hotel restaurant et cetera how are you looking at those exposures from a longterm view and do you have any plans to reduce those exposures over time pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc certainly in hospitality where we have no appetite we havent generated a new hotel loan since the first quarter of last year i would tell you that our underwriting for cre retail certainly has changed weve really shifted that to single tenant credit tenant exposures and grocery anchored so i think part of the answer is just shifting the appetite within cre restaurants are certainly more conservative we have some in franchise concepts that were still tracking well but i would tell you with restaurants its guardedly optimistic and strict underwriting so hopefully that might have helped to answer your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then my last question terry given the earlier commentary about the improved valuation and maybe youre looking at ma opportunities a bit differently is the flip side of that that youre not looking as active on the buyback side i know you have million plan out there but how are you currently thinking about that given the valuation of the stock thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think steven ill answer your question directly on the buyback but just to be clear i think i used the phrase and talking about that i dont want to oversell it overbill it im not saying were going to make an acquisition im just saying were in a different position and there are lots of discussions going on and opportunities to consider those kinds of things so i dont know im just trying to get that shaped up where somebody understands we do have a high valuation does create some opportunity but i dont want to overplay the likelihood that were going to run out here in and make much acquisitions because i dont think were going to make much acquisitions so at any rate let me hopefully theyll better frame that currently then as it relates to the buyback yes i think youre right i dont think you ought to have an expectation right now that we would ride back in and buy shares primarily as you say is a function of the valuation we just we looked at that differently wed like to have an authorization well watch it over time but i dont think we have an intent to buy shares at this price steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for the clarification and thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you steve operator and thank you and our next question comes from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is now open brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group hey guys good morning pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc how are you brett harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group im good thanks first harold i was curious maybe whats your crystal ball might be telling you on liquidity i know you thought that might start to drain at some point and its obviously extended out for yourselves as well as the industry can you maybe give us some color on how you see that liquidity being deployed over time and how much of that might happen and how much of it just kind of drains naturally with people using cash harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah that is a crystal ball its kind of question brett we likely will a modest amount of bonds will likely go into the market here over the next two to three quarters we might build our percentage up from a up to a or something like that it wont be a big number that weve got in all likelihood i dont know billion or so of ppp loans that we anticipate coming to us here over the next four quarters so were that will provide additional liquidity to offset redeeming some of these wholesale funds its going to be a fight itll be a war to try to drain some of this liquidity we remain optimistic about loan growth targets we remain optimistic about reducing deposit rates and we particularly got some larger depositors that are more ratesensitive and they fully appreciate how the value equation works and if they can find a better number at another financial institution theyll move that money and right now were okay with it we dont think it damages our relationship with our client at all so theres a lot of things that are in play to try to get some of those liquidity off our balance sheet brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group okay appreciate the color there and then the other thing i was curious about was in the guidance for expenses you talked about requiring increased infrastructure support but youre obviously giving guidance for non personnel expenses to be lower this year can you talk maybe about the increased infrastructure support what that all entails are you guys doing anything on investing or infrastructurally that might change the dynamic outside of the personnel line harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah not really i dont think were doing anything as far as bricksandmortar weve got a couple of branches i guess in play here this year but theres nothing big as far as buildings or technology that would cause you to be call it a blip on the radar most of our infrastructure build comes around personnel and itll be call it for one revenue producer we end up hiring two to three other people in support of that revenue producer so thats the infrastructure that we refer to in those comments brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 okay and then if i could sneak in one last one around the change to the equity compensation just the tangible book value per share growth being added to that does that change how you might view ma in terms of thinking about payback periods or ph tangible book dilution m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well it certainly is impactful so it would be something we would need to consider traditionally our board has been willing to work with us on significant events and how that might impact longerterm incentive plans brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group okay fair enough thanks for all the color operator and thank you and our next question comes from matt olney from stephens your line is now open matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey great thanks good morning i want to ask about the banks sensitivity to interest rates on slide you gave us some good disclosures and it looks like the bank continues to move to a liabilitysensitive position but when i read some of the comments on that slide it sounds like youve got some levers to pull to offset this over the next year or two should we be assuming by the time rates do increase on the short end whether its next year or or whenever that pinnacle will at least be in a rate neutral position if not assetsensitive just trying to appreciate kind of what the strategy is thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question matt and youre right weve got some levers weve got billion in loan floors that are a gain right now that we could unwind today and thatll free up billion in floating rate assets to move us to more an assetsensitive position so weve got some levers like that that we can pull to help alleviate whatever that slides indicating currently so yes were not panicked about our balance sheet or anything like that we think weve got a great opportunity when rates begin to move most of my liability sensitivity is tied around loan floors so its all about that once we can get a better view of where our rates move we can always start moving around on loan floors and cure the problem matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then circling back on the loan growth and the outlook definitely appreciate the guidance its kind of a bottomup review with all the lenders in the bank curious how do indiscernible utilizations rates look today compared to levels a few years ago just kind of appreciate if that does rebound how much incremental benefit we could see from loan balances at the bank thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah utilization i think is at down from something like that so those would be loans that are currently on our books not anticipating a big growth in utilization so all of our growth we think is going to have to pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 come from loans that are currently not all of it but most of our growth is going to have to come from loans that are currently on somebody elses balance sheet indiscernible matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it thank you operator thank you and our question comes from catherine mealor from kbw your line is now open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi cath good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wanted to start a followup on the gaap nii guide how much ppp do you expect to come through in within that guide harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question and we see each other up on trying to anticipate how much ppp ive got you can calculate the interest income with where that might pay down to but its all about the forgiveness and weve got about million in additional accretion to come to us we think a lot of thats going to come this year its probably more than of what we likely will realize this year maybe upwards to of it catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then as we think about harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think the big news catherine i think the big news we got out of a when we talked to our relationship managers is theyre not hearing anybody say theyre not going to go for forgiveness so i think most if not all of that billion is hanging out there on our balance sheet would likely find its way to forgiveness and i would imagine its going to be more sooner than later because i do believe sometime in the near future the loans last year theyre going to get into principal paydown loan here soon catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful and then as you think about the big picture ppnr growth indiscernible a couple quarters ago where we looked at ppnr per share kind of exbhg ex the excess liquidity and ex the ppp pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 do you think this is a year where ppnr ex those three variables can grow or is it more bhg is kind of helping you fund this expense growth this year and maybe thats more of a kind of a next year thing harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well theres no question bhg is helpful but also reserve release and provision expense is also helpful to help fund some of that incentive growth so that dynamic is very much present the ppnr growth for all banks is relatively benign this year and in most cases its negative so weve challenged our folks we think with a fair target itll be positive and hopefully we can work our way through it to see at least some incremental growth and big top quartile indiscernible catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then if i get you one more just for tim tim whats the path to moving loans off criticized timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah catherine good question as you know the vast majority of that is our hospitality book we go through every hotel loan when i say we thats myself our special assets manager and our cre credit officers every quarter every single loan million and greater and ive been thinking about that in particular with the hospitality book we may have some moving off to criticized this quarter second quarter well have some i think more third quarter and more fourth quarter but theyre still catherine may be a part of that book that well take until early so i think youll start to see it accelerate in terms of positive migration out of criticized back into past youll see that start this quarter and accelerate third and fourth quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay that sounds great thanks and great quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator and thank you and our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to touch on the fact that bhg is significantly adding to their staff this year and this reports that they may look into point of sale ending at their home improvement stores can you guys just clarify what the plans are there and where that stands thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc michael i think what they think their hiring plans will be similar to last year for and then they got similar hiring plans for the next few years i think they added or people in so they anticipate a similar pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 number this year the point of sale they are looking at all kinds of new product verticals and thats one of them so yes they are definitely looking at it and they are building plans to go after that market michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i thought they had employees kind of about and theyre going to add about this year what youre saying sounds a little bit different i guess was the article that i read about wrong or just what has that been harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think as we talked before that article was written off of an internetbased thing that talked to the marketing guy i think theyll get to the over the next few years but as it stands right now i think the number for this year is somewhere around to employees michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay helpful and then maybe just back to the nii guide this year it does seem like the ppp fees will be higher and then kind of the core will be lower when can you reconcile that to us versus days ago and then are we at a point where exppp that the nii will grow up from here is that the expectation harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well were very hopeful that core net interest income exppp will grow with core loan growth for sure right now were going to stick with our forecast that nii growth will be highsingledigits for this year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you and our next question comes from jennifer demba from truist securities your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you can i circle back to the ma topic terry just curious you said that the higher currency makes ma a little bit more attractive can you talk about what kind of properties would be of interest to you right now from a size geographic standpoint we know youre kind of biased towards with more commerciallyoriented properties m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i appreciate that indiscernible about the topic indiscernible why i think people understand what im trying to say to them so anyway i appreciate the question i think on ma its just obvious that if you have a stock to trade the tangible book value is not much of an option indiscernible versus peers that creates the opportunity to consider pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 to your question about what kinds of things would be considered i think you got your whole range of options that i think everybody in the industry is considering own ma which would include strategic combinations in indiscernible acquisitions indiscernible so you got the whole realm of things that could be looked at there i think when you get down into make an acquisition my own sense jennifer is that im not interested in doing a lot of acquisitions that wouldnt produce something close to doubledigit accretion and earnings accretion and so you can make your own assumption zone so what does that mean but just sort of back of the envelope math i think it means youve got to buy at least billion organization to that creates a kind of the impact and so you know this as well as i do its not like indiscernible there theyre going where that threshold of as you say being in a maker of the market having commercial orientation and producing that level of accretion so hopefully that would shape what our considerations are catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery your line is now open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys thanks for taking the question most of my stuff has been answered just one or two things harold just on the going back to the expense guide for a minute if you look at last quarter just kind of how youre thinking about it versus kind of hey laid it out this quarter and the bottom line impact is there much change i think last quarter was highsingledigit growth off of last years base of around and now this quarter you kind of tweaked it to be to on the comp and then a decrease elsewhere but just can you when you get to kind of the net number of what youre thinking about is it still a similar spot to that type of range is that how it still shapes out with the new guide harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so brian i dont think its moved much between the end of last year and current brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so its similar guide okay and then just one of the questions kind of harold i mean if the loan forgiveness the ppp occurs i mean its most of that coming back in the cash and until you can redeploy it or how is it changing the size of the balance sheet i guess is is it currently different now than it was previously harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think so brian i think as those loans paid down well try to deploy that cash into new loans someway somehow is that what your question was about brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 yeah just kind of the average earning assets i mean i guess as the loans get forgiven and it comes back to cash theyre coming back to cash right now until you can redeploy thats kind of whats continuing to occur harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so theres no doubt that well have additional liquidity from the ppp credits and hopefully we can get the loan engine moving and be able to get that money redeployed quickly brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay all right and then just one last one for terry just on that last question on the ma period i understand what youre saying just geographically its still i mean i guess is there more focus or more interest in i know its a limited number of targets but would there be more interest in adding to your existing footprint or i guess is it more likely that you would have to go to likely go to a different market than youre currently in given how youve talked about how much opportunity there is within your existing footprint m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i would say its i guess again brian to go back and think about the size of the acquisitions that we have to make those things are and so forth i think you have to draw a conclusion that you most likely go to different markets in existing markets but again im not ruling that out im just saying brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc it seems like you find more opportunities in additional markets than you do in existing markets that would meet that criteria brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes got you okay i appreciate thanks and great quarter guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc
