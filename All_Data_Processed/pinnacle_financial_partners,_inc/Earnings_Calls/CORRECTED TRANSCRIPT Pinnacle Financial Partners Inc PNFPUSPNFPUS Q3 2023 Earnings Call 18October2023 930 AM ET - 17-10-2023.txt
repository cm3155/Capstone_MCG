financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that i am now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you paul and thank you for joining us here this morning most of you have endured these calls before and so you know were going to begin every one of these calls with our shareholder value dashboard because these metrics are our north star there are a lot of interesting things that can be talked about but ultimately were here to produce shareholder value and this is how we think you do that and of course always us who believe nongaap measures because this is how we really manage the business at a glance you can see that we continue to grow revenue and eps more rapidly and reliably than peers we continue to grow our balance sheet volumes more rapidly and reliably than peers and that we relentlessly focus on tangible book value also our asset quality continues to be strong with problem asset metrics continue to outperform peers at basis points net chargeoffs are excellent but a little lumpy you can see that they jumped up just a little bit this quarter because of a large much publicized syndication we were in but generally our nonperformers and classified assets have been peer leading with npas ranked number three among peers in  and classified assets number two among peers so from feet its my opinion that we continue to deliver on all the key drivers of real longterm shareholder value creation so with that harold lets take a more indepth look at the quarter harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody we will again start with deposits reporting linkedquarter annualized average growth of almost in the third quarter was again a real positive for us the third quarter was yet another indication that obtaining deposits in an environment where competitors can be unpredictable is very much doable for this franchise early in the third quarter competitive rate pressures remain fairly intense as we approach the middle part of the quarter it appeared that rate pressures did subside somewhat the mix shift of noninterest bearing to interest bearing slowed during the third quarter as we were down million much less than prior quarters of this year allin deposit cost increased to id like to point out that we ended the quarter with the spot rate at quarter end of only basis points higher than the average for the quarter that is the smallest difference weve seen between the average rate and the quarter end rate in a long time signaling to us perhaps a much more modest increase in deposit rates in the near term and are optimistic about the pace of deposit rate increases as we head into the fourth quarter we also believe we will continue to be disciplined as to the relationship between pricing and growth of our deposit book we believe we can continue at a more deliberate pace for gathering deposits without leaning heavily on the rate component of our growth as many of you know our goal is to be the best organic deposit grower and we feel like we are on our way terry will speak more to our deposit gathering capabilities in a minute pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 the third quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us as we were reporting linkedquarter annualized average loan growth given that were maintaining our eop loan growth for at lowtomidteens growth as weve mentioned over the last several quarters were exhibiting much more discipline on fixed rate loan pricing which ended the quarter with average fixed rate loan yields on new originations of spreads maintenance on floating and variable rate loans continues to be strong were pleased with yields on our originations and believe we can continue to maintain similar loan spreads as we enter the fourth quarter as the top chart reflects our nim decreased basis points which is more than we anticipated at the start of the quarter what we did anticipate was an increase in average cash as we have more cash on our balance sheet spill over at the end of the second quarter into the third quarter during the third quarter our cash balances did decrease modestly as our liquidity did decrease during the quarter so were believing that liquidity will be less impactful on our margins in the fourth quarter that said with a backdrop of slowing deposit pricing and with fixed rate loan repricing at better spreads were growing more confident that our nim has found the bottom or we at least are fairly close were anticipating our fourth quarter nim to approximate our third quarter nim or perhaps be slightly down obviously should deposit pricing heat up in conjunction with competitors just becoming more aggressive we might need to revisit that assertion but as we sit here today we feel like we are close our rate forecast we believe is consistent with most rate forecasts out there our planning assumption is that were not going to see another fed rate increases and future fed rate decreases are not expected until the second half of next year because of a lever in the higherforlonger rate environment with that we dont believe a nearterm fed rate increase will be that impactful to us either in the fourth quarter or as we enter as you know the macro environment is volatile and very unpredictable right now and given that we will have a continued bias towards elevated interest rate risk management guarding liquidity of our balance sheet and modest capital accretion as for credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continue to perform well in the third quarter our belief is that credit should remain consistent for the remainder of the year our credit officers continue their routine periodic credit reviews of the portfolio and bring resources to bear for borrowers exhibiting potential signs of weakness the cre appetite chart on the bottom right is largely unchanged from the prior quarter but does reflect perhaps a slightly more conservative appetite for multifamily and industrial from what we have shown over the last few quarters chargeoffs did increase to basis points during the quarter during the quarter there was a lot of information out there about a single syndicated credit out of atlanta we were a participant in this syndication for about million not sure of any recovery opportunities at this point but we will continue to work with the lead bank and the syndicate to recover whatever might be available we have shown this slide before the top left chart deals with trends in construction originations we began dramatically reducing our appetite for construction last summer which is consistent with the chart a modest amount of new construction originations during the third quarter was primarily due to new home construction loans under existing officer guidance lines to our residential homebuilders pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 secondly much discussion about renewals of the commercial real estate fixed rate loans which is the objective of the chart on the top right over the next several quarters we will have approximately million in fixed rate commercial real estate renewals coming up for repricing where the average rate on these loans is currently around our current yield target for these loans at renewal will be in the to range all together we have about billion in fixed rate loans maturing over the next two years with a weighted average yield of thus we see real opportunity from a repricing perspective now onto fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg the impact of the gain on sale of fixed assets and the loss on the sale of investment securities fee revenues were up slightly from the second quarter couple of items to point out here which we believe are noteworthy during the quarter we recognized million revenues from a solar tax investment that we entered into in december of we received a thirdparty report as to the adjusted value of the investment during the third quarter which provided us with support for the results we posted were excited about our solar business and what we believe it can and will accomplish starting last year its relatively new to us as we only have about million in balances but we have a staff with seasoned industry veterans from large cap franchises so we expect great things from this business line just like many of our other equity investment valuation gains and losses are difficult to predict and thus the ongoing contribution to our fee revenues will always be choppy as i mentioned well go into bhg more in just a second but wanted to emphasize that bhg continues to represent less of our pretax revenues this quarter than in previous quarters as we noted in last nights press release we believe bhg has decreased to a contribution to this years fully diluted eps compared to approximately last year we anticipate that fee revenues excluding bhg the gain on the sale of fixed assets and investment securities losses will come in at around a midtohigh singledigit growth rate for over not a lot to say here this time on expenses total expenses came in about where we thought we did adjust our incentive accrual downward to of target this quarter based on where we believe our performance metrics will come in for all of our outlook for expense growth for over remains in the high single low double digit range same as last time one quick comment on fdic insurance we are expecting a special assessment to replenish the bank insurance fund before the year end our understanding is that the industry will likely recognize that as a charge to the pl when that amount is known just so you know we expect that charge to be in the million to million range and this charge is not reflected in our outlook for expense growth our tangible book value per common share decreased to at quarter end down slightly from june the decrease was primarily attributable to the rise in intermediate term interest rates during the third quarter and the resulting impact of that on the market values of our afs portfolio and of course aoci our outlook for the fourth quarter is that our capital ratios will likely be flat to down next quarter contributing to this will be the usual fourth quarter pl matters fourth quarter loan growth et cetera of note is that bhg will report their day cecl adjustment in the fourth quarter and this will serve to reduce our capital accounts by a pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 modest amount this day noncash adjustment will not impact our fourth quarter earnings repeat it will not impact our fourth quarter earnings and should approximate a charge to capital of approximately million subsequently bhg will likely need to maintain their reserves at amounts approximating of total balance sheet loans the impact of maintaining loss reserves at those levels going forward has been considered in our fourth quarter outlook for bhg we believe the actions weve taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital ratio have served us well and we have no plans currently to alter our tier capital stack in any sort of common or preferred offering the chart on the bottom left of the slide details several pro forma capital ratios as of the end of september although we dont anticipate significant changes to the capital rules were pleased with these results and believe they will likely compare favorably to other peer banks now a few comments about bhg the top right chart is consistent with our previous quarterly earnings calls and details that production has been consistent over the last several quarters at about billion to billion per quarter placements to the bank network were less in the third quarter while placements to the institutional investor were again at the highest level ever and signal that demand for bhg paper by some of the most respected asset managers in the country continues to be really strong as we look to the fourth quarter bhg believes origination volumes will likely be less than  as they continue to shrink their credit box and they believe sales into the bank network could experience some decline over the next few quarters as their client base continues to wrestle with a more restrictive funding environment and we also believe bhg will likely want to build loan inventories in the fourth quarter as they head into that said bhgs bank network which we believe is very unique and we believe will be difficult to replicate by any bhg competitor will continue to grow and provide ample liquidity to bhg as to liquidity we presented the slide last time in order to provide additional insight with regard to the significant liquidity channels available to bhg and placement of their loan production bhg successfully negotiated two private whole loan sales of about million during the third quarter importantly these type sales are executed with no recourse to bhg lastly bhg is anticipating their eight capital markets transaction here in the fourth quarter theyre currently anticipating the volume for the securitization will likely be in the million range all things considered we believe bhg has assembled a very enviable liquidity platform that should serve them well for many years to come this is the usual information weve shown in the past indiscernible spread trend since the first quarter of the top chart represents the gain on sale of the offbalance sheet bank network and the bottom chart is a blended chart of all onbalance sheet funding which incorporates the historical buildup of balances as anticipated spreads for all balance sheet loan placements have come in somewhat with higher rates and a tightening of bhgs credit box during the third quarter the blended spreads for all balance sheet loans were slightly higher than the bank network given the balance sheet loans reflect the buildup of balances over the last three years as we head into the fourth quarter bhg believe that spreads for both on and off balance sheet loans should be consistent with the third quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 as weve noted in previous quarters bhg has tightened its credit box over the last several quarters particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base production volumes remain strong even with tighter credit underwriting bhg refreshes its credit score monthly always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing base credit scores are obviously up from previous years the vintage chart on the right is helpful to understand how much underwriting has improved and does impact the loss content in the portfolio at the top of the chart on the lines reflecting originations in and through lines begin to level out at cumulative loss rates of to vintages after begin to reflect improved performance with the lines leveling out within the to loss range bhg continues to allocate resources to the postcovid vintages of through the first half of as those vintages bhg believe were graded higher than the borrower ultimately wanted and thus skewing the loss rates higher for those loans this slide again provides more information on credit and detailed reserve losses for both off balance sheet and on balance sheet loans bhg is optimistic about credit at the end of the third quarter typically for bhg approximately of the loss is incurred in the first three years of origination but with rate inflation as was mentioned about the and the first half of vintages loans should and has come to light sooner as a result bhg has expanded significant resources to bulkup collection activities and will be instituting inperson closings from new borrowers which were suspended during covid although higher than historical losses are likely for the near term the credit performance of the portfolio does appear to be improving holding towards cautious optimism as we enter the fourth quarter and into bhg had another strong quarter with approximately billion on originations and are on track to achieve billion to billion originations this year which is slightly less than last year but consistent with our outlook from the last quarter as we mentioned last quarter bhg had a conservative bias going into the third quarter such that as they continually tightened their credit box production in the last half of the year was expected to be lower than the first half the current fourth quarter loan production forecast should approximate million to million in order to follow fullyear guidance which is less than the quarterly production levels thus far this year during the quarter bhg record several onetime expenses related to the markdown of a building they anticipate selling as well as markdowns of some software assets and other items that were related to some business loans that bhg has elected to not support any longer these onetime charges amounted to approximately million during the third quarter these amounts have been incorporated in bhg results and outlook for net earnings for are forecasted at million to million inclusive of the onetime adjustments just mentioned and is basically consistent with the range from last years forecast quickly the usual slide detailing our financial outlook for we have a bias currently toward a more cautious outlook when it comes to credit interest rates and capital our job is to manage the risks that face this franchise every day what we know is that our business model remains relationship based nimble and resilient our management team has significant experience and has tackled economic downturns before we have great confidence that well be able to manage the highquality banking franchise that our shareholders have come to expect from us and can currently handle whatever curveballs get thrown our way pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 and with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks harold warren buffett and others have famously said manage the fundamentals and tell the story and the stock will take care of itself i believe that at pinnacle we are managing what we believe are the fundamentals the critical variables to creating outsize shareholder value and so my goal here now is to tell the story to crystallize extraordinarily valuable deposit franchise we built as an industry weve been in a war the last three quarters and in the fog of war its easy to get confused about whats really important weve all just witnessed three highprofile franchises go to zero primarily because of two things number one their enterprise wide risk management in my judgment they all take extraordinary risk and two the stickiness of their deposits and so the risk of management teams will undertake matters and how they use their security book matters and how they manage interest rate sensitivity matters and how they manage concentrations matters and then how they attract and retain their deposits matters personally i wouldnt want to belong any bank our size that stuck in the commodity trap that means an undifferentiated franchise from a clients perspective because in that case theres no ability to reliably grow deposits at a pace sufficient to sustain outsized revenue and eps growth and no ability to retain deposits in difficult times which again jeopardizes the reliability of their growth but a bank that can attract talent by virtue of being an employer of choice a bank that utilizes its client experience as the primary basis by which it attracts clients and retains clients a bank that can rapidly and reliably grow net interest income the largest component of the eps thats a valuable deposit franchise anyone whos heard me tell pinnacle story has heard me talk about the pinnacle philosophy that excited associates produce engaged clients and nothing enriches shareholders like engaged clients made in raving fans that bring more business to you and refuse to leave you in times of uncertainty many times when i discussed that philosophy i try to live the proveits the workplace awards weve won the service and brand awards weve won the outsize shareholder returns weve produced over short medium and longterm timeframes but today i want to show you the power of building a great workplace of being an employer of choice happily most of the banks that have leading market share positions in our footprint are hemorrhaging talent and while i cant provide a metric to prove it i do believe were the employer of choice throughout our footprint what bank do you know thats produced a compound annual growth rate of revenue producers of a per annum increase in the number of experienced revenue producers while still producing top quartile profitability thats a valuable deposit franchise and by virtue of the associate engagement youre able to create you provide clients an experience they like to love that engages them in such a way that they want to bring you more of their business and they want their friends and colleagues to experience the same thing those are what the researchers refer to as promoters at according to jd power we have the second highest net promoter score of all the top banks in the united states based on assets set number two in the country thats pretty top gun of course jd power has more of a consumer slant so we rely a little more on coalition greenwich which is more focused on businesses according to greenwich our ability to create an experience that results in raving fans promoters is literally one of the best in the nation i know no competitor in our footprint is coming close to a net promoter score and id be surprised if any bank in the country is exceeding the net promoter score pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 and of course that begins to explain our substantial outperformance in terms of deposit growth shown here on the far right our net deposit growth our ability to attract and retain deposits is wildly better than peers both prior to the bank failures and subsequent to the bank failures and id say thats a valuable deposit franchise nashville is the best case study of how this all works using the fdic summary deposit market share data you can see on the far left the market share leaders in nashville in june of prior to pinnacle opening in october of i included the data in the middle not only so you can easily see the outstanding market share we took and who we took it from but so you can see the most recent data on the far right that our model continues to grow deposit market share in nashville in at a very rapid pace so much for the law of large numbers what i hope i bring to light for you is that while it is incredibly advantageous to be in large highgrowth markets which we are nothing literally nothing is more valuable than a differentiated experience that can reliably take share from the weaker competitors that dominate our markets think about that over years in existence in nashville the top three banks gave up share and we took nearly of the market from them thats a valuable deposit franchise and honestly im not aware of a single bank in the country with that kind of deposit building franchise and while weve been at it the longest in nashville based on fdic market share data for were growing share in virtually every market that were in all of those listed here have positive share growth and look at this when you compare the deposit volumes were now producing in markets like atlanta and washington dc to our first three years in nashville where we now dominate you have to be blown away by how that propels sustainable growth going forward thats a valuable deposit franchise as ive alluded to several times now to be a valuable deposit franchise in addition to your ability to attract deposits is critical that you can retain deposits in times of crisis and we dont need to invent metrics that we hope might be predictive of how sticky banks deposits are we can know right i would say the best test of a banks ability to retain clients was how well they did in that period of time leading up to and immediately following the silicon valley bank value think about it it was the worst bank scare since the great depression and it occurred in this time of frictionless transfers its never been easier to transfer bank balances than at this time and really thats we saw three relatively large bank failures fail precisely for that reason but at pinnacle in that extreme crisis not one of our largest depositors left us in the month following those failures not one and the balances of those totaled billion at the time of the svb failure and billion roughly a month after that failure its just hard to leave a bank you love and trust and thats a valuable deposit franchise a further proof of the power of the franchise is that according to greenwich over the next to months in our footprint pinnacle is the most likely bank to earn more business and the least at risk of losing business the most likely bank to earn business and the least likely of losing business for each of the three banks that dominate our footprint in terms of existing deposit client share in other words for each of the three market share leaders between and of their clients indicate theyre likely to lose business in the next to months thats a huge opportunity for us to produce outsized growth given our proven ability to take their share pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 and because our clients engagement with us nearly of our clients indicate a likelihood that well earn more of their business i would say that a franchise is most likely to earn new business and least likely to lose business is a very valuable deposit franchise and of course the ultimate goal of that is to rapidly and reliably increase total shareholder returns over the last years our total shareholder returns have substantially outperformed all our peers as weve grown in asset size our pe multiple has contracted more than most of our peers largely i suspect due to fear of the fall of large numbers and so for us to produce outsized total shareholder returns as our pe contract we had to substantially outgrow peers in terms of eps which we did but given that net interest income by far the largest component of eps itd be hard to substantially outgrow peers in terms of eps over an extended period of time without growing them in terms of net interest income and itd be hard to outgrow peers over the long haul in terms of net interest income without outsized loan and deposit volume growth so hopefully youll agree that a bank that can attract talent by virtue of being an employer of choice bank utilizes its client experience as the primary basis by which it attract clients and retains clients a bank that can rapidly and reliably grow its net interest income the largest component of eps thats a highly valuable deposit franchise paul ill stop there and well take questions question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions and the first question today is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steve harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the deposit side and specifically on deposit mix so you guys had very strong growth in the interest checking account right its over half on the average balance and that rate is now can you give some color is that where new customers are coming into the bank or see a migration from noninterest bearing into that account is that where we should expect to see outsized growth harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 yeah i think well see more in the money market accounts interest checking accounts i think a lot of the new strategies and the new verticals will point clients in that direction looking at our new account growth over the last call it three months steve about to now it is in noninterest bearing so were still attracting class and need the operating accounts but i think a lot of the sales force is aimed at more products that are more aimed towards those interest checking and money market accounts steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it harold you called out the spot rate on total deposits but what about this account where are you pricing relative to the right now harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont have that right now but i would imagine that new account growth is probably in the just a wild guess steve i would think the spot rate is probably in the call it probably pretty close to the maybe a little north of that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then helping to offset that earning asset yields are picking up a bit bps quarteroverquarter given where longerterm rates have moved harold should we expect more of a lift in our earning asset yields coming in the fourth quarter is that picking up harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we are were expecting some more lift primarily through the repricing of the fixed rate loan renewals we got to like we mentioned about million in construction coming in but i think all together were looking at somewhere close to maybe call it million or million in fixed rate renewals coming through this quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so if we put those together you think nim is flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter is it safe to say thatll likely be the bottom of net interest margin for this cycle harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats what were hoping for steve were really hoping that it was this quarter that the bottom is when we hit but weve looked at the projections for the fourth quarter several different ways under several different scenarios and it looks like were really close steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the expense side i appreciate all the commentary that more of the expenses are now being directed at revenue producers versus support staff when i balance the commentary that youre putting out terry is that youre putting out the word to accelerate the pace of new hiring right just given the market opportunity but pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 theres less pressure on back office when i put those together how should we start to think about expense growth for next year could you give us just a rough range because i dont know how to put those two together harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were looking at the expense plan right now and we got to be the largest increase in expenses that were hopeful to cover would be our incentive cost were accruing so well add into the plan for next year we are introducing to our board and the comp committee several different ways that we think we can cover that additional cost and still produce the revenue growth that i think everybody expects us to produce so were obviously not going to introduce into our expense plan any number that its going to cause our eps to be unduly hit so were looking at what our projections are next year for us and our peers were likely to try to achieve some percentage growth and likely well well always be trying to get into the top quartile of that group so i know thats a lot of word salad for you steve but at the same time were not really ready to kind of talk about where we are on expenses terry has challenged us to look at our expense base with a lot more diligence here this quarter as we look into steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right but harold if we just put together new hiring with less back office does that imply less pressure on expenses or more pressure on expenses because of that harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well thatll obviously produce better operating leverage on that particular notion for sure we dont intend to hire as many in the support groups next year as weve done over the last two years so that is an added benefit what i want to make sure is that we get on the table that were also planning to increase our expense base next year to more of a target payout or incentive approval so just dont let us forget dont forget about that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc steve i think on what youre chasing there on just the impact of the net hiring of revenue producers and non revenue producers that ought to be a net positive and again i think what harold is trying to do is make sure everybody gets it that our incentives are tied to performance and so were hoping to produce a performance that warrants the target payout or above next year and so that in and of itself is a big increase to the incentive line but the item youre chasing on the net impact of hiring it ought to be a net positive steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it got it okay and maybe just lastly just if i zoom out right when you look at loan and deposit growth just fullyear expectations for this year maybe for you terry as you look at the strength of your markets the pace of new hiring do you see us exiting and entering with more momentum than what we saw in or is it about the same thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 i would think itd be more momentum in this has been quite a year lots of concerns about interest rates when you had it in lots of concerns about inflation quickly into the bank failures and bang bang bang boy just a lot of opportunity for caution but i would say weve stayed you know better than i do what all the variables are out here to figure but it feels a lot more stable as i look at what our business model is today than it did in early steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it perfect thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you sir operator thank you the next question is coming from brett rabatin from hovde group brett your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning thanks for the questions wanted to talk about the kind of the normalization of credit and just you obviously were into loan credit like quite a few regional banks were that raised net chargeoffs a little bit this quarter but wanted just to ask about the million increase in classified assets if there was anything that was sort of more normal or can you talk maybe just about that in general and then just maybe we can talk about the snc book and how big that is and how you think about that harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah as far as chargeoffs for this quarter without the amount express chargeoff i think wed be somewhere consistent with the prior quarters we think going into the fourth quarter we dont see anything outsized currently that would warrant us thinking that chargeoffs are going to increase significantly from that where we are today brett did that give what you were talking about are you interested in more information on brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc yeah yeah i know that one credit kind of impacted net chargeoffs but just wanted to kind of hear about the increase in classified if there was anything that was underlying there that had a commonality and then just maybe if you could give any color on the snc book and just any characteristics of that portfolio how much you lead how you kind of run that portfolio harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the classified did bump up on us i think the credit officers are all over that one its a healthcare credit that we have banked for a while and they just believe that their metrics are not looking where they or theyre not performing at where they need to be performing and so theyve downgraded it that contributed to primarily the increase in classified this quarter was that one credit so that was that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 as far as the snc book is concerned were running about of total loans in our shared national credits so the way we approach that largely is we want inmarket the loans themselves we want them to be inmarket we want them to be relevant to our business development such that we can bank the principles of the business and weve traditionally done that here in nashville and in other markets the one credit that chargedoff this quarter theres a little bit of an anomaly for us not only i know theres been a lot of discussion about it being idiosyncratic and all of that it was also kind of unusual for us because there was a bunch of banks in it and we were at the end of the line and so with that thats not something we normally like to do so i dont think youll see a similar event on those particular matters m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brett on that thing on the sort of normalization of credit metrics i think you probably heard me say theyll have to normalize theres no chance we can operate at historic lows forever and so theyll have to normalize but when you sort of look in there your nonperformers are down during the quarter classifieds my bet is even after that increase will probably still be the third best in the peer group and so again theyre going to have to pick up normalized but it still feels really good from my perspective brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful guys and then maybe i just want to make sure i understood on the guidance back on the margin in the fourth quarter it kind of seems like youve got assuming the trend continues of slower upward trajectory of funding costs and quite a bit of assets repricing in the fourth quarter im not saying youre sandbagging in the margin guidance but it just seems like the tenor would be a little bit better are you just being cautious on that relative to the deposit struggles for the industry this year and potentially an increase in competitiveness around deposit pricing or is there something else that im missing harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i dont think youre missing we do believe that were like we said were near bottom if not at the bottom on our margin we think weve got great opportunities on loan repricing like you talked about we think the deposit book is behaving well we will keep our fingers crossed as to whether or not we can move the margin up but as we sit today we think we are where we are and we think were going to be in pretty good shape as we go into brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great i appreciate the color guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brett operator thank you the next question is coming from timur braziler from wells fargo timur your line is live pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the question just keeping with that same line of comments lot of discussion around net interest margin im just wondering about net interest income and how that acts in the higherforlonger environment is the expectation here that as long as the fed is higher for longer nii is accelerating the growth in that nii is accelerating or is there some offsetting dynamic that might keep that growth rate more limited m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes thats a great question i think from our perspective the way our book typically behaves as weve got all these fixed rate loans that are going to reprice in this higherforlonger kind of narrative but if the fed kind of keeps the lid on shortterm rates thats where most of our deposit pricing will likely be influenced by so if you dont see any more rate increases then the competitive pressures will be what drives kind of our deposit cost and we believe that were really competitive on deposit cost presently so we dont think weve got a lot of i mean well obviously have some increases in deposits due to competitive rate pressures but at the same time we dont think weve got nearly the hill to get over that weve already conquered timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe one for terry in the release you mentioned a couple of times more vulnerable competitors and asking your line leaders to accelerate their efforts in recruiting can you maybe just talk through the competitive landscape i know youve had good success in picking up talent and market share from some of the larger banks now theres some dislocation from regional banks in that space as well maybe just talk through the broader competitive landscape and then if you could put some numbers around what an accelerating effort for recruiting might look like in m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the thank you for nice question give me a chance to clarify here a little bit so i think from a competitive standpoint the market share leaders are in our southeastern footprint generally in almost every major urban market theyre going to be dominated by three and to some extent maybe four banks truist wells fargo bank of america and regions and so thats the line of scrimmage for us tomorrow you know lot of people over the years ask how do you compete with this little bank or that little bank generally i dont know the answer to because the line of scrimmage is always those market share leaders we are finding and i think i mentioned in my comments a lot of those banks that dominate our market are emerging talent some due to integration issues some due to i think regulatory pressures all those sorts of things but if you think about those banks i listed there most of them have a difficult landscape which brings pressure in their organization a lot of them are cutting staff a lot of them are losing staff because of the continued rollout of tightened policies and all those kinds of things and so my belief is there weve enjoyed vulnerability among those competitors really throughout our existence but i would say that the vulnerabilities today seem higher say more than the vulnerabilities that weve enjoyed through our first years and so thats sort of the backdrop of what would cause me to say hey we need to be seasoned this opportunity i dont mean to be dramatic but i do honestly believe that it is a once in a generation opportunity to build a big franchise on the shoulders of that disruption pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 in terms of what does that mean in terms of hiring people i think youve followed us a while you know that i think over the last three years prior to we set a record for the new volume of revenue producers that we hired we wont do that this year you know maybe be down say this year from previous records of revenue hires my belief is well take it back north to approach those previous records so you might be able to hire more revenue producers next year than this year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color thank you for that and then just lastly for me on bhg i know in recent years theres been discussion on maybe lowering overall ownership or getting more creative in an effort to avoid some of that cecl impact with the cecl impact now here already and embedded in kind of the capital position in the fourth quarter does that change your longer term view on partnership with bhg does that maybe entice you to stick with the current structure for a longer period of time or is there still a want to maybe reduce some of the exposure harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah timur thanks for the question i dont believe cecl impacts our view of bhg our relationship with bhg and what our outlook is for bhg we still have a great partnership with them we meet with them routinely we understand what their strategies are now going into were optimistic about what they can accomplish and we think theyre building a very valuable franchise over the short and the intermediate terms that could be valuable to anyone that might think that that going into that market segment would be advantageous for them so were proud of what theyve been able to accomplish and were optimistic about what could be coming to us next year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks appreciate the time i guess it sounds like most of the growth is going to continue to come organically from the new hires i assume that a lot of dc atlanta some of these newer markets i guess my question is any new newer markets for you guys that you might push into with these accelerated hiring plans andor with some of the dislocation and weakness in other banks do you think about ma opportunities any more intensely at this point m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the let me take the last part first i think as it relates to are we considering ma more intensely than previously i think the answer to that is no were not i think as it relates to market extensions and so forth stephen youve heard us talk about this over a long haul if you go to memphis and draw a line up to dc and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 down to south florida we wont be in all the large urban markets in that triangle there the obvious void is florida florida is attractive to us because its dominated by those same players i just mentioned in response to timurs question and so anyway those are attractive markets we do not and i think you know this we dont sit up here and say okay we need to find our way to jacksonville florida we need to find our way to tampa florida and set out some initiative to bring that about it occurs the same way that all our other recruiting does generally somebody in our organization will turn somebody up it says hey this group right here these are my buddies ive worked with them they could build you a big bank and so well pursue those and see if we find something thats good for them and good for us we dont feel like we have to go to do any market extensions to produce outsized growth we think the current hiring methodology and the existing footprint will do that but theres no doubt we do see opportunities and if we find the right team that could build us a big bank well go next week or next month or next year if we dont find them thats okay too we dont have to get there we believe the current recruiting model in the existing footprint is going to produce outsized growth so i hope ive hit at what you want but if i have not ask again stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co no thats very helpful terry i appreciate that and then maybe kind of hopping back to credit i mean i know terry you said you obviously expect some normalization over time and you guys have been running the bank successfully for a while and gone through credit cycles there seems to be a big disconnect between what people are expecting or what fears there are around credit and what banks are actually seeing can you tell us for you guys what gives you the most confidence that that normalization wont be catastrophic or what have you or what some people seem to be expecting on the downside m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the principal thing is how we develop our business and so just a quick reminder what we do is we target experienced bankers who somebody has seen be successful at that job ph over the average experience of the people we hire is years and so when youre hiring people that have been at it for years handling local business for two and a half decades it does produce rapid growth because generally they handle that book that well and they could move the book quickly but more importantly it produces outsized asset quality because they leave the bad credits behind because theyre well familiar with whats going on with those credits and so forth and so again my belief is that that has accounted for the outstanding credit performance that weve had and i believe that it will continue to do that you know some people can go back and say well terry how did you do in the great recession you have outsized losses i think id say two things on that stephen for whatever is worth is a little more than yes but i dont want to comment on it when you look at the if you call the great recession the period from first quarter to the fourth quarter of in that period of time we lost a little less than thats a horrible number but all our major competitors the banks that we talked about here regions first horizon bank of america suntrust at that time lost anywhere from to times that level and so it was an outperformance although it was a bad number and so we say what made it bad we had just completed two acquisitions immediately prior to going into the great recession our natural model didnt produce much in the way of commercial real estate pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 but the acquisitions that we made left us with a concentration in residential real estate at the worst possible time to have one we dont have that concentration today and so the combination of the model and the differences in our company today versus prior cycles are the principal reasons i feel good about where we are stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect helpful and maybe one just last clarifying question here you just mentioned consumer real estate which you guys dont have a lot of this time around which is great but i did notice that you put the reserves up there to like as a percentage of those loans from harold was there anything meaningful there that drove that increase i think theres recoveries in that portfolio yeartodate so were just kind of surprised to see it tick up there harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the moodys model is what is driving that increase and the outlook for those borrowers they may require that small percentage increase stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it but nothing specific that youre seeing there right now that gives you any real indiscernible harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no not really i dont think weve seen anything of any consequence in that book we certainly i dont think we anticipate any losses in that book stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thanks so much for the color guys i appreciate the time m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks stephen operator thank you the next question is coming from brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hi so just wanted to get an idea of thoughts on the securities portfolio i know there was some more restructuring in the quarter just what are your plans there for how that should trend going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think were about where we need to be on securities we dont have any imminent plans to do any more we will probably hold right here and see what happens with intermediate rates here i think weve gotten the segments of the securities book that we were looking to get so were going to hang on right here and see how it goes from here brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it and then terry just wanted to take another angle just to place accelerate hiring could you just talk more about the type of talent thats available and kind of how that compares to maybe a more normalized environment m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so the type of talent thats available are the biggest category of revenue producers for us is we use the term financial advisors most of the industry calls them relationship managers but what were speaking of our bankers who control a book of business or book of client and the focus there would be what is wealth management advisors small business advisors and middle market advisors so thats really where most of that hiring should occur the other categories of revenue producers weve been pretty successful in other wealth advisory and when i say that im speaking about brokers trust administrators and so forth so those are sort secondary categories of revenue producers but the largest segment is just what you might think of as an old fashioned relationship manager that handles a large book of banking business brandon king q analyst truist securities inc great m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc have i answered what youre asking brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah and i just want to get a sense of are you seeing kind of maybe a higher level of talent thats more available now compared to a couple of years ago m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 i think it would be hard for me to say that the talent itself would be at a higher level than the talent that weve hired but i would say that we have an expectation that the volume thats available is more than its been over the last to months brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay no thats fair thats fair and then just lastly harold if you could give us a sense of what youre thinking about as far as the run off of fhlb advances and runoff in brokered deposits and wholesale funding harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah fhlb finances i think have longer terms i dont think they will be running off very much here until next year brokered deposits i think we have some meaningful deposits that are coming up for renewal in the first quarter of next year brandon and so right now we intend to just pay those off and rely on our core funding growth to replace it brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and do you know do you have the amount on hand of whats up for renewal in the first quarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think its about million something like that million or million we reduced our wholesale deposits some this quarter and we intend to do it some in the fourth quarter as well but i think theres a meaningful number that comes up in the first quarter brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brandon m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brandon operator thank you the next question is coming from matt olney from stephens matt your line is live matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning everybody on that last point harold on the broker deposits coming up for renewal next year any color on the cost of those deposits as compared to your more recent incremental cost of core deposits that you could potentially replace that with pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think those deposits were acquired right around the first quarter right around silicon valley and signature i think they were probably in the call it the mid somewhere in that matt olney q analyst stephens inc and how is that compared to the incremental deposit cost for the bank harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well right now new accounts are coming in at around in a weighted average rate so there ought to be some pickup there just based on that matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then you mentioned earlier about the pressure on the noninterest bearing deposits have slowed quite a bit any other data points you can provide about where you saw maybe later in the quarter or the first few weeks of this quarter and then as you talk to customers what are your expectations for that balance from here harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think theres going to be some drift downward but largely by about the call it the middle of july the end of july we started seeing stabilization in those numbers every day so weve been hanging in there now for a while and so hopefully thatll continue through the end of the year we typically get a buildup in balances in the fourth quarter so were keeping our fingers crossed on all that matt so we may be planning for some decreases but were hopeful were more flattish going into the fourth quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and then just lastly just to cleanup on the bhg commentary i think you mentioned some adjustments that were made mark have a building and some software i think you said the impact was around million did i get that right and how much has been accrued for so far in the third quarter and how much could we see in the fourth quarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think theyre done with respect to those two issues they exited their call it their indiscernible which is their merchant financing business they decided to get out of it i think that was about a million charge and they wrote down a building for about million so that was an accrual where theyre putting that building on the market hope to sell it here over the next couple of quarters but for those two situations theyre done they feel like theyve got adequate reserves in place for those matt olney q analyst stephens inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 and with respect to bhgs repositioning examples like that are there anymore items where there could be additional impairments or events like what we just saw harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think bhg has taken on a much more diligent review of all their product set i would imagine that going into theyll be keenly focused on our core lending products the securitization network and those two products because they spent quite a bit of effort with some ancillary businesses that i think theyre looking at whether or not they want to continue to invest in matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you guys harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks matt operator thank you the next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw catherine your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks one followup on bhg i guess maybe just a big picture question on bhg is how are you thinking preliminarily about earnings growth in bhg into it feels like weve got a lot of moving pieces but it feels like weve got potentially credit costs improving once you get through the losses in this e and f tranche from the vintages but then youve got the impact of cecl and providing at and maybe a little bit of a softer gain on sale margin so this is an area we could still see stable earnings into next year or potentially could there be downside harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well be looking at probably and im not trying to be cute here a more boring bhg going into and i think part of that is because theyre going to be focused on their core businesses and less on some of these ancillary businesses that theyve been investing in over time but youre right theres a lot of puts and takes here but i think their plan is to generate some growth next year into in spite of whatever headwinds they might have regarding cecl or where the rate curve is what have you catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and is the difference in the gainonsale margin between the placements to banks versus the placements to show investors is that difference large enough to make a big difference in the revenue outlook harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think they will plan on a lot of stronger allocation to the bank network next year now keep in mind those spreads are all pointintime spreads so those transactions are occurring every day and thats the spread they pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 flag the onbalance sheet spreads are a culmination of three years of buildup so theres historical spreads built into that which were higher two or three years ago than they are today so theres a weighted average kind of process on those spreads but i do think as far as to your question on new production theyre likely to allocate more to the bank network where they get to gainonsale ph tree catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay so your comment about that being less that was more of just a fourth quarter comment versus a strategy into harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so i think what they want to do is try to build some inventories going into and then be in a position to kind of make sure comes out where they want it to come out catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then circling back to this conversation of nii growth is it seems like you still have a fairly positive outlook for just balance sheet growth this year and typically youre able to hit eps growth targets because you grow revenue so fast and so as we think about this next year with revenue growth still better than your peers but probably moderating just given the rate environment were in can you help us think about just the optionality you have with actually generating positive operating leverage growing expenses at a slower pace than your revenue growth as a way to hit eps targets is that something that you feel like you would be able to do in the scenario where revenue growth comes in lower than expected harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well have a keener eye on operating leverage going into i think what weve got to do is position the firm in a spot to where revenue growth whatever that number might be that our expense growth is within that range well have to sharpen our pencils pretty hard this year to see that that happens but as it sits today thats kind of where were prepositioning all the budgeters and the planners that are working as a matter of fact today on how to get a good plan as terry said that warrants an incentive accrual at of target m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc catherine i think you know this but just to make sure everybody gives it the focus of our company has been and continues to be a top quartile performer in terms of revenue and earnings growth and so eps growth and so that hasnt changed at all that will continue to be the case and i think to harolds point its our intent and our belief that well build a plan that does that even in the base of a meaningful pickup to the incentive expense because as you know were currently accruing at and hopeful that well be accruing at or north next year so anyway that gives you some sense of what our outlook and belief is catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah and i dont mean this to be a loaded question but just kind of thinking about your peers and think about eps growth in this year you know weve most of the street is forecasting through eps could be down from pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 most of your peers into next year and so even if youre at the top quartile and thats flat eps growth or even down eps growth still better than peers but still flat to down is that a scenario that you can still have a full payout of incentive comp or do you feel like you hold yourself to a higher standard where you might need to still kind of adjust to that to hit an eps target thats appropriate for pinnacle m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thank you for that thats a good question i think what i would say is if we were to do what you just described there and just find our way to say okay all we got to do is get above of peers that wouldnt take much earnings growth and that would be about three years of flat earnings growth eps growth for pinnacle if that were to be the case and you can be sure that is not my target so at any rate i guess the technical answer to your question is that something that could happen i suppose it could happen but i dont think you ought to expect it will happen catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the clarity i appreciate it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you the next question is coming from brody preston from ubs brody your line is live brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey harold i just wanted to followup on the deposit costs i think you said the blended rate is coming on at is that thats inclusive of the noninterest bearing correct harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes yeah that would include noninterest bearing on now this is just new accounts so brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc right pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so thats right brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc so just based on the commentary i think you said to is noninterest bearing earlier on the call so it implies about like an interestbearing cost on new money at about is that accurate harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats probably fair cds are built into that so yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay so is that i guess on the interestbearing deposit cost slide the spot rate is that how we should expect that to trend maybe over the next couple of quarters harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think youll get that i think new account growth the volumes are theyre meaningful to us but theyre not what generates a lot of the bulk of the deposit growth so the net deposit growth i think core deposits was million probably new account growth was maybe half of that something like that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right and also just on the loan side i think you said you had about million to million coming due for fixed rate loans next quarter is that a fairly consistent level that we should be thinking about on a quarterly basis through harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i was trying to do the math in my head because ive got about billion coming up for renewal over the next two years and its pretty evenly dispersed weighted more towards the near term so whatever that number comes out to be probably with the cre renewals youre yes probably million something like that in the near term in the quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay cool and then just on the bhg i appreciate the commentary and some of the puts and takes there you mentioned that they had a building that they were planning on selling that they wrote down i dont know if you got this granular with them or not but do you happen to know kind of what percentage the writedown was im assuming that that was like an office building or something that they no longer need pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the number i think they bought it for like 20something million its down in south florida so i think thats what the right indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc you said they brought it for what harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc about 20something million i want to say its about a number but dont know indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i think you said you had of the loans were sncs do you happen to know of that what youre the lead underwriter on m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc the sncs that were the lead underwriter on brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yes sir m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc those are all where the other bank is the lead underwriter on the sncs weve got about a billion in participations that weve sold but none of those are in the snc category brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay so the snc exposure is all the is just all sncs that the other banks are the lead underwriters on m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thats right and you know how all that works in order for them to buy our loans we got to buy their loans theres a lot of reciprocity in this process and right now im running about billion or billion in acquired participations of card sncs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 okay then i just want to follow up you know and this isnt really a followup for this call but i think its been asked before just in terms of longterm view on succession planning and i think you guys have built a pretty unique model which is attractive but also might be challenging for another bank to kind of maintain if they were to try to buy you guys especially just given the independent culture that you have i mean how do you think about longterm kind of the growth path for pinnacle succession planning and maybe partnering with another bank m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think our board understands and takes seriously its responsibility for succession planning they review succession plans at least on an annual basis i think our succession planning here would probably resemble most peoples when i say most peoples most banks succession planning by first of all you got to plan on two axes what do you do longterm succession and what do you do in the way that our other key members get run over this afternoon so kind of a longterm plan emergency plan they have both i think in the case of the longterm succession plans a few they consider really three or four different variables for how you handle succession of course the one that most people are interested in is internal candidates and we have a number of high potential candidates that we continue to work with and give expanded responsibilities to and so forth to see how they develop and determine their capabilities over time we have candidates that are outside the firm that we have talked to and continue to talk to from timetotime that have probably both an interest and a capability to come in and work with us and move the company forward and then of course we can get in and do considerable range of companies that we could acquire to pick up talent and maybe more likely moes where theres a like mindedness and suitable talent there so the board considers all those variables and i think brody i dont know probably a year ago or more we talked through some grants that were issued to ensure that existing management stays in place until succession plans are set and so my belief is the boards active and has any number of options for how the succession would work is much like i was a basketball player you know in fast break you fill all the lanes and hit the open man i think thats really what the board view is theyll look at all the options and make the best way when its time to make one brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it i really appreciate that answer terry i guess maybe if i could just sneak one more in for harold i forgot to ask you harold do you happen to have what the reserve on the office portfolio is harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc its about basis points somewhere in that neighborhood it didnt change much from the prior quarter so thats where we are brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much i appreciate it everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 all right operator thank you and the next question is coming from brian martin from janney brian your line is live brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey guys good morning ill make it short here just the on the margin outlook harold it sounded though if were at the bottom here the those loans you talked about repricing the fixed rate loans and then just kind of the hope the outlook on deposits remaining favorably i guess should see the margin trend higher as we get into assuming this higher for longer environment is that in general how youre thinking about the margin here in the coming quarters harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think weve got a lot more buyers towards probably a margin thats going to accrete up but feel the same kind of pressure to run down as weve had over the last couple of quarters for sure brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay all right and then just on the fee income just as far as the kind of big picture ex the bhg commentary youve already given just the yeah as far as the growth youre seeing this year kind of that mid to highsingledigit rate does that feel like a sustainable level i know you talked about the solar piece this quarter being kind of maybe not one time in nature but you sounded pretty optimistic about that business going forward as well so just trying to think about how fee income looks here what sustainable m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean what we want to make sure is that people understand that its going to be a choppy line item and it has been a choppy line item for the last several years you know its kind of a recurring nonrecurring kind of thing but we fully intend to support the solar business stuff and weve got several projects that were looking at currently but the difficulty is trying to forecast when those projects close and when they get the necessary regulatory approval so were going to continue to invest in that product like i said weve invested in several industry veterans there that came from some of the large cap franchises and we like our prospects so along that along with our other equity investments that weve got we still feel pretty good about the decisions weve made on all those fronts and what opportunities that they present us brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay so kind of that core i guess youre calling it kind of the core fee income inclusive of that those equity gains but exclusive of bhg is still excluding some of the benefits you expect to get from the solar that mid to high singledigits still feels pretty sustainable as you look forward here at least in the near term m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 i think thats accurate brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay and then just lastly on the reserves i guess is your outlook i maybe i dont you harold or terry just with the normalization in credit if you do see chargeoffs or npas tick up a bit here is there any outlook for a change in building the reserve some given what the outlook looks like i know fourth quarter still sounds pretty strong but just as you get into next year should we be thinking about seeing some reserve builders the current level were at more likely sustainable m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah right now we dont anticipate any big buildup in the reserves starting in the fourth quarter weve been looking at the credit pipeline it seems pretty solid at this point who knows what will happen going into but right now we feel pretty comfortable about where we are and what our chargeoff experience has been here over the last few years brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got it okay perfect thats all for me thanks guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brian operator thank you there were no other questions in queue
