im now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you matthew good morning thank you for joining us this morning for the fourth quarter earnings call obviously well focus on performance in the fourth quarter of and our outlook for both of which i think are very good we always start with the shareholder value dashboard on a gaap basis and then as adjusted which is really what our focus on in trying to manage the firm there is no doubt presented one of the most difficult operating environment for banks since the great recession i expect few if any banks were able to completely outrun the rate environment and its impact on revenue and earnings growth in but despite the difficult operating environment we grew our tangible book value at in and produced a total shareholder return our unusual approach of investing in our business particularly in terms of acquiring new talent even during difficult times is one of the primary reasons weve been able to continue to take share and grow balance sheet volumes which of course has accounted for our rapid and reliable growth in revenue and earnings which we believe accounts for our extraordinary total shareholder return over nearly decades now pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 weve said for some time that its our expectation that credit metrics have to normalize its about to operate over time at the very low level of problem loans that weve enjoyed over the last two years we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter but the npas and classified assets still remain below our fiveyear median which is itself very low and net chargeoffs during the quarter were just basis points so fourth quarter of was an excellent quarter for us particularly on those metrics that point to future shareholder value creation and so with that in mind let me turn it over to harold for a more indepth look at the quarter harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody well well again start with deposits reporting linkedquarter annualized average growth of in the fourth quarter which we believe was a real positive for us we did see some endofyear deposit outflows that lowered our eop balances and are hopeful to see those balances return this quarter eop deposit rates were up only basis points the smallest increase in quite some time we felt like the rate of increase for deposit rates would slow as we entered the fourth quarter so were pleased with where we ended up deposit indiscernible down quite a bit with fluctuations in our overall rates driven somewhat by mix shift as several larger more expensive depositors built balances at yearonyear we remain disciplined as to the relationship between pricing and growth of deposits we will continue at a more deliberate pace for gathering deposits without leaning heavily on the rate component for our growth as to loans the fourth quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us as we are reporting a linked quarter annualized average loan growth for the fourth quarter as we mentioned over the last several quarters we were pleased with our results on fixed rate loan pricing which ended the quarter with average fixed rate loan yields on new rate originations of spread maintenance on floating and variable rate loans continues to be strong with coupons in the high and low on new loans this slide segments our net loan growth based on several categories to help everyone better understand the source of audio gap our expansion into dc atlanta birmingham et cetera was a source of much of our loan growth in thats why were so excited about our announced entry into jacksonville we have our experienced bankers in these new markets and give them the tools and resources to build a large local franchise much of our loan growth is not new in new borrower is not to new borrowers showing up a pinnacle bank with a new idea to pitch our borrowers have extended relationships with relationship managers over in many cases decades of working with each other this is not just true for charlotte nashville charleston and other legacy markets but that applies to atlanta dc birmingham as well as jacksonville as the top chart reflects our nim was flat quarteroverquarter we hope to see a modest increase and continue to believe we have great opportunity to see nim expansion in as we entered the fourth quarter we felt like we were fairly close to follow our margin and have some confidence that we have more importantly we feel we should see a stronger net interest income as we move into our interest rate forecast we believe is consistent with most rate forecasts out there our planning assumption is that future fed rate decreases begin in may and then we see three more before the end of the year importantly our yield curve shift is that itll that it will be less inverted by yearend as for credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continued to perform very well in the fourth quarter our belief is that credit should continue to perform well as we move into pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 absent a couple of large chargeoffs in was a good year as to losses realized from our portfolio we mentioned one nonperforming credit in the press release last night debated on whether to call it out or not or not and for all of our npas is basis points which is very respectable in comparison to prior quarters but given the change from prior quarter we decided to talk about that one credit we feel that particular credit is well down the road of being rehabilitated and expect no loss currently similarly there was an isolated incident in both classifieds and past dues we downgraded a channel a credit to classified late in the fourth quarter and one credit also accounted substantially all the net change in past dues for that credit the borrower did pay interest current before yearend but we were past maturity and waiting on the borrower to settle a few matters before granting the renewal which we anticipate in the next week or so concerning commercial real estate again some select information as to the top left chart construction originations are very selective and reserved for projects where we have a strategic reason to participate for those that follow regulatory ratios our concentration ratio was at at yearend roughly the same as the prior quarter our goal is to reduce that ratio ph approximately of the mix appetite for construction lending will remain limited at this time secondly much discussion about renewals of commercial real estate fixed rate loans which is the objective of the chart on the top right over the next four quarters we will have approximately million in fixed rate commercial real estate renewal coming up for repricing with the average rate on these loans is currently around our current yield target for these loans at renewal will be in the to range altogether we have about billion of fixed rate loans maturing over the next two years with a weighted average yield of thus we see real opportunity from a repricing perspective for these loans now on to fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg and various other ph non recurrings fee revenues are up to linkedquarter we are very pleased to report that our wealth management units had a strong and we fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue into as we noted in last nights press release we accomplished a significant boli restructuring program during the quarter as we sought to increase yields on about million in boli contracts with various carriers in the end we feel like the payback period on the approximately million in charges we incurred during the quarter is around a year and a half we believe the anticipated tax equivalent cash yield on our entire boli portfolio as a result of all this will approximate in and in this compares to approximately a yield currently now expenses fourth quarter expenses came in about where we thought as we noted in the third quarter we expect special assessment from the fdic in the fourth quarter a million fdic special assessment was recorded in the fourth quarter which we will pay to the fdic over eight quarters beginning in june of our incentive costs for the fourth quarter include the final calculations for our cash bonus awards the total costs for were slightly over million in comparison to our target payout the plan would have required about million more in cost so our earnings include million of incentive savings which is exactly how the plan is supposed to work if we hit targets participants are eligible for target awards if we dont then we arent i will speak more about our outlook for expenses in in a few minutes capital our tangible book value per common share increased to at quarterend up yearoveryear our focus on book value generation has been a big positive for our firm and has we believe benefited our firm pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 meaningfully growing tangible book value has been top of mind to leadership over the last several years and has impacted decisioning as management has not been willing to risk significant tangible book value dilution by perhaps building a large investment portfolio if we had we could have put tangible book value generation at risk impacting capital ratio in the fourth quarter were several matters that we discussed in the press release last night in addition to the boli restructuring and the fdic special assessment we incurred a million capital charge indiscernible bhgs adoption of cecl on october which was consistent with our expectations for the last year or so again this amount did not impact fourth quarter earnings but did impact our capital and our capital ratios the chart on the bottom left of the slide details several pro forma capital ratios at the end of ph this year and how we compare to peers on these ratios as of the end of september although we dont anticipate significant changes to the capital rules were pleased with these results and believe they will continue to compare favorably to other banks and speaks to our efforts to manage tangible book value effectively now to bhg as we look at fourth quarter originations and as we mentioned last quarter fourth quarter origination volumes were less than the third quarter as they continue to shrink their credit box and id like to emphasize that point bhg estimates that of their borrowers in and the first half of will not qualify for a bhg loan today we are very supportive of the efforts by our bhg partners with respect to credit discipline and client selection we are also very pleased to see that sales into the bank network during the fourth quarter were basically consistent with the third quarter the banks continue to have a strong appetite for bhg credit with original indiscernible fourth quarter placements to institutional buyers were about million less than the third quarter bhg did increase heldforsale inventories on its balance sheet by million in the fourth quarter which provides a nice runway going into as to liquidity not a lot of change here from last time bhgs liquidity platform remains exceptionally strong during the fourth quarter and again as we mentioned at the end of the third quarter bhg plays about million in loans as a result of their second abs transaction for bhg also successfully negotiated a million private whole loan sale during the fourth quarter importantly these private sale transactions are executed with no recourse to bhg with many of these clients coming back to bhg routinely and planning on being back in as well as to spreads this is the usual information weve shown in the past detailing spread trends since the first quarter of on the bottom chart the spreads for all balance sheet loan placements have expanded as lower coupon loans originated more than two to three years ago pay off so that borrower coupons for the onbalance sheet continue to increase again as weve mentioned for several quarters the spreads on the chart for onbalance sheet loans represents the buildup of the book over the last few years bhg believes that should the fed begin to reduce rates in mid year such a move would likely result ph in more loan spreads for bhg for both the bank and institutional platforms now to bhg credit as weve noted in previous quarters bhg has tightened its credit box over the last several quarters particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base average fico for has improved to from in the chart on the right details originations in through indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 level out cumulative loss rates of to whereas vintages after begin to reflect improved performance with the lines leveling out within the to ranges on the reserves again the usual trends on loss reserves for both on and offbalance sheet loans as expected the adoption of cecl on october for the onbalance sheet loans resulted in about basis point increase in reserves trailing 12month losses for onbalance sheet amounted to in the fourth quarter if you just look at the fourth quarter losses were for onbalance sheet loans bhg has been anticipating that credit losses will begin to trend down after the fourth quarter right now bhg believe they have a great shot at seeing reduced credit losses in the first quarter and with a much greater degree of confidence for reduced losses by the second quarter of now about bhgs earnings and production last quarter we anticipated that fourth quarter loan production indiscernible approximate million to million and it came in at the high end of that range impacting earnings and also as we mentioned last time bhg recorded several one time expenses that approximated million in the third quarter impacting our fourth quarter results was approximately million in severance and other nonrecurring costs a lot of work has been done by bhg to get ready for with a tighter credit box bhg anticipates flattish production comparing to that said the bank network and institutional platform both remain very liquid for bhg also as the postcovid credit issues fade into the background along with a potentially better yield curve all of this could add up to make a much more accommodating year for bhg than with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you harold well as harold mentioned earlier in the fourth quarter of we hired our leadership team for our market extension into jacksonville florida earlier when i was discussing the performance i highlighted the fact that we continue to invest in our business even during the difficult times which in my judgment has been the key to the extraordinary total shareholder return we continue to produce one of the good things about was that it showcased our enterprisewide risk management system which provided the necessary guardrails to protect us when the numbers stumbled but more importantly put us in a position to stay in the course while many are trying to restructure their business model with major expense initiatives which may gain shortterm earnings but have a devastating impact on longterm shareholder value creation our conservative approach to credit to liquidity and interest rates put us in a great position as we continue investing in our business the risk management system not only protected us but again left us a capital base and an ability to continue to grow which is what we intend to do most of you know that our target market has been all the large urban markets in the southeast which are some advantage where florida has been our principal ph void most of you have heard me talk about this for a long time the catalyst for when we decide to expand to a new market is when we have the availability of leadership that we believe can build a billion bank over a fiveyear period of time in any of those large markets last quarter i used this slide to build on the fact that having started on with a number bases back in in nashville we now dominate the nashville market by almost any measure including things like fdic deposit pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 share and were actually running faster in the relatively recent startups in atlanta and washington dc than we did as we built out the atlanta market as you can see here jacksonville florida is on par with our other large high growth markets extraordinarily healthy and rapidly growing and its ideally suited to us from the perspective of the competitive landscape its dominated by the same exact competitors that weve been facing out with for now years i always try to help people understand this the size and growth dynamics are really important in terms of the success in the markets that weve been in but more important than the size and growth dynamics would be the competitive landscape its important to have competitors from whom you can take market share as ive already said talent availability is what controls the time and as you can see our leadership team in jacksonville is uniquely prepared to build a big bank there scott keith wholl run that market for us is a 34year veteran in that market he was the former regional president for north florida at truist and he led an employee group serving clients in that market hes joined by debbie buckland who has years of local experience and was the former market president in jacksonville at truist and prior to that suntrust and they are also joined by bryan taylor who has years experience in the bbt truist franchise as well he most recently led north florida the middle market effort and through all of north florida so i think its evident why jacksonville and why now so with that i think ill turn it over to harold and well walk you through the outlook harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry quickly well go through the financial outlook what id like to do is condense all the information on the slide down to five key points first is deposits we have to maintain consistent reliable growth in our deposit book at a reasonable price thats what makes all the initiatives that weve invested in together new deposit is so critical i believe weve made great headway i think we have got great tools in place i think weve hired experienced professionals to promote and lead these depositgathering initiatives so high single to low doubledigit growth seems reasonable secondly bhg we dont anticipate bhg to have a great year we do expect modest growth ph midsingle digit so i think that comes basically from a new firm one that has the ability to achieve sustainable growth with an intense focus on growing core businesses weve had a great partnership with bhg and we believe that the partnership is as strong as ever we believe the leadership at bhg is focused on the franchise and not on pushing more widgets through the pipe the credit can get back to its usual run rate by the second half of this year bhg could have a great year loans and loan pricing primarily fixed rate loan pricing weve done well to get fixed rate loan pricing to their current levels in comparison to peers we do quite well but we can be better we will continue to focus on that as i think that will be absolutely critical to our ability to grow net interest income high single to low doubledigits in now id like to talk about expenses it seems like our expense growth rates are always a topic of great discussion in we harvested at least million out of our incentive plan to help support our eps results for in order to support our people in we need to have a plan that accommodates upwards of million to million in additional incentive expense as always we absolutely have to hit numbers if we dont hit numbers we wont pay pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 weve averaged about of targeted payout in my years here at pinnacle we are not bashful about using the incentive pool to help support our earnings results i do think a reasonable expense target at this point for probably would lie between million and million so as youre putting together your models that range seems fair for today lastly earnings this management group understands to get the share price moving up youve got to grow core eps we believe was a indiscernible year so were aiming north of that weve looked at peers and have stacked ranked earnings growth rate projections for our plan will be comfortably in the top quartile of earnings growth we have to grow earnings in so our targets reflect that to be successful we cant let expense growth outpace revenues its that simple hopefully we can achieve our planning assumptions such that all of our associates earn their incentive while in time the share price reflects all the hard work that theyve accomplished and with that matt ill turn it back over to you for qa question and answer section operator thank you everyone the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions analysts will be given preference during the qa operator instructions your first question is coming from ben gerlinger from citi your line is live benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning guys harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi ben m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc curious did we just kind of touch base on the expenses harold a good clarity indiscernible so when you think about just expenses overall is this entirely going to or a majority going to lenders or is there some technology or back office spending that needs to be done i mean it just seems like pinnacle is getting back to legacy pinnacle of kind of low doubledigit growth is good but it could put some pressure on ppnr over or just just kind of clarity on where that expense might be going harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 yeah ben ill start and ill let terry kind of add his comments as well on this whole topic kind of our non personnel expense base for next year is fairly reasonable i think last night we talked about in the press release that our if you exclude incentives growth rates probably in the low doubledigit range i think thats pretty conservative with a call it an to kind of target for this year i think were more of a high singledigit kind of grower with respect to excluding incentives our it team has gone through what they believe theyre going to need to do this year we spent a lot of extra time on operational expenses and information technology expenses for we think weve got a good plan and we think weve got a plan that they can accomplish and at the same time not overboard on kind of the expense burden with that ill stop and let terry kind of finish m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ben i think to your point weve continued to invest i think it would be foolhardy not to invest in technology i mean youve got all the digital progression ai all those sorts of things so were not a donothing company we continue to invest in technology and stay current i think you know about our firm were not trying to innovate anything were not trying to do something particularly new and different our idea is to be a fast follower and so to do that we have to stay current so certainly there are expenditures other than incentive type expenditures but one of the things that i guess i would offer for clarity in this company your question was phrased around is it all going to lenders so in this company of our salaried employees just buy an annual cash incentive plan and of us yet earn our incentive based on hitting our revenue growth targets our earnings growth targets and keeping asset quality strong so people are aimed at that outcome and that thats who gets paid and so having only paid at a level this year you wouldnt expect most of our associates desire to make therefore we have to run fast enough to produce enough revenue and earnings growth to satisfy the shareholder returns but get ourselves indiscernible i think we can do that benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc sure no thats good color i think its philosophically hitting commission targets and bonus payouts is a good thing because it literally means you hit your upside targets but then if you could kind of just parse through here a little bit so when you think about adding additional lenders and just running more lenders specifically than just revenue producers how are they incentivized or how much flexibility do you give them on gathering deposits in this environment i mean given youre pretty rapid at pace of growth are you giving them a little bit more slack to gather deposits im sure thats on the scorecard as well and kind of tangentially to that does that kind of put a lid on the margin overall i get the back book repricing will produce a higher margin by the end of the year im just kind of curious on how you guys are structuring their incentive on gathering deposits and any flexibility on the rate they might have m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ben let me just reinforce the point i made earlier most people have a hard time understanding that incentive systems here at pinnacle most people are used to structured plans where relationship managers get paid on one basis and branch managers might be paid on a different basis and so forth thats not what happens here of our salarybased associates which would include lenders financial advisors office pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 leaders every category of salaried person their incentive is tied to this company getting its revenue and its earnings targets and so thats a really important thing that i think a lot of people dont get that direct connection and so when you ask about the incentives for the lenders if you will to gather deposits and so forth they have an incentive which is were going to have to hit the revenue and earnings growth targets and to get that done weve got to produce the loan volumes to get that done we have to produce satisfactory deposit volumes and so thats the mindset inside this company people are aimed at hitting that revenue target for the company and the earnings target for the company its not an individual individually based incentive plan i dont mind to say to you i dont want to go too far afield from what youre asking but that idea is really important every quarter we meet with all the associates of the firm and we dont film about hey heres where we are on our performance on revenue and where we are on earnings and how that impacts incentive and these are the things we need to do but it is really easy to crystallize for every single person as an example if were not hitting if were not repricing fixed rate loans at a satisfactory margin man every quarter you can stand and hear its okay look heres what the target is heres what we did heres what that cost us in terms of revenue and earnings and man everybody can see through clearly to exactly what has happened and what needs to happen in order to hit the target so i dont need to go on too much about it i hope thats helpful benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah it is i was just more so curious like how much flexibility are you giving them on rate in order to gather those deposits m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc the our again well were getting way down into the philosophy here but as you know we hire experienced people the average experience of people that weve hired is years fundamentally what we do is try to make sure they know what our targets are and then give them plenty of freedom to execute generally the relationship manager has the flexibility to decide what the price is for the deposits and what the price is for the loans what happens is in fact because it is out there they know we have to hit the targets theyre not inclined to overpay on deposits or get underpaid on loans and so forth and of course we have a tight management system where every month were going down through everybodys performance with key performance indicators talking about hey whats the reason for this why are you doing this this price needs to come down all those kinds of things so it takes an active management but generally were handling that in arrears and empowering our clientfacing people to be able to handle client needs without a lot of bureaucracy benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you appreciate it thats helpful color thanks guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you ben pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 operator thank you your next question is coming from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi brett m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted to start with bhg and just try and understand a little better the confidence on the reduced losses by can you just walk us through your thought process on bhg and obviously the guidance is for fairly minimal growth and contribution this year but it sounds like youre thinking it could be a lot better if certain things play out right with credit and perhaps growth harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question for us its we have conversations with bhg quite frequently and they still believe that the first half of and the loans were aware these outsized losses are originating at large they will see substantially all their losses within call it the first months of origination and given the great inflation a lot of those loans have come to kind of the knowledge that theyre not there wont be good loans fairly quickly so they believe that where they are today at the call it the end of that a lot of the credits have already gone through this proverbial pig through the python and so theyre still looking at some of the credits and are watching those but they believe that theyre substantially through the bulk of the problems brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then just thinking about fintech m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold i think to say it safely brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc im sorry terry pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc brett i was just going to say i think to say it safely theyre watching their migration analysis and to harolds point the largest part of the losses occur in the first months so when you look at those migrations they really have just a few more months to go before they will have completed that 30month cycle for that period where the great inflation occurred and so again i think harold tried to isolate out the ongoing fico scores and so forth for more recently originated credits and so its just a matter as he said of getting that pig through the python which is literally just several months away brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then just around bhg conceptually the ipo market for fintech was fairly minimal last year and this year it could be better is there a potential for you guys to maybe sell a portion of bhgs ownership to potentially increase capital ratios or how do you think about bhg ownership from here and are they obviously at one point where it would appear to have been thinking about an ipo maybe just walk through your ownership of them from here m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brett i think i would say this its really just a reinforcement i think ph off of what ive said for some time so we still enjoy a fabulous partnership with bhg i continue to love that business as ive tried to say if i own of pinnacle i want to own of bhg and we would focus on gainonsale transactions but it doesnt work that way and so i think weve come to the conclusion that the volatility and the difficulty in getting bank investors to understand the model at some point its just not worth continuing the battle and so we have decided whenever the times right that we would like to reduce our ownership interest at bhg in whole or in part not to be trite but im more of a buylowsellhigh guy and so its not an ideal time to liquidate our position were comfortable with it it provides a great source of income to us and so well continue in the current arrangement but whenever the markets get to a point where you could enjoy a higher price we would be willing to sell some or all of our position in bhg operator thank you operator instructions your next question is coming from timur braziler from wells fargo your line is live timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning maybe m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc talk through can we maybe talk through the expectation for net interest margin cadence throughout the course of the year with the expectation for it to be relatively flat in the first quarter and then for your outlook with three pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 rate cuts it seems like there maybe isnt that much nim upside im just wondering kind of what your expectation is for nim cadence throughout the year given the broader nii guidance harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah timur i thought whats in our plan for this year is that we will see continued increases in our fixed rate lending so thatll provide somewhat of a tailwind here in for call it earning asset yields i think we will have to be very aggressive if there is a rate cut now keep in mind that basically of my deposit book is indexed so i do have that head start probably more so than maybe some others but our relationship managers will have to maintain constant contact indiscernible with their depositors over the course of so that we can respond very quickly with respect to rate cuts i appreciate that other banks can go into their systems and punch a button and lower deposit rates we can do that too for some portion of our deposit book but what its going to do for us or what were going to have to do is be in touch with our clients in a way that weve probably not been in play because were going to be taking money away from them basically timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just looking at the commercial real estate maturities can you talk through what years those loans were originated and im just wondering for the and prior vintages just how different are those credits given just how different the world is today compared to prepandemic harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think most of our commercial real estate loans are probably on a three to fiveyear kind of term most of the both owner occupied and nonowner occupied loans are on a fixed rate so i think by and large most are ready for rent increases i think the last number i saw was that theyve seen some to increase in rentals over the last three to four years but we feel like theyve got the cash flow to support the increased interest rates operator thank you your next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 im going to start guys with following up on that so when i look at slide you guys are pretty excited about these renewal rates coming in much higher on your commercial real estate portfolio but that same phenomenon is keeping many investors out of the banks particularly the regional banks and all of the regionals are even painted with the same brush no matter where your markets are so i have two questions one is for the commercial real estate loans that were reset in the fourth quarter excluding office i know you have a large office portfolio could you just share with the investor community whats happening with these loans theres this pretend and extend mentality that you guys are just extending these and theyre not renewed can you share with us whats happening how much of the value has changed are you able to just renew these without any impact on credit and as you look at the ability to turn those including office without seeing a material negative impact on credit harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc steve i will start m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold do you want take a first crack at that harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill start and let terry clean me up here im not hearing from the credit officers theyre having any kind of particularly onerous time with respect to getting renewals accomplished or having to sacrifice concessions or whatever to get these to get these new loans booked i think what we do enjoy and you mentioned you kind of you kind of mentioned it is that we are in great markets and were seeing rent increases were not seeing any kind of reductions in occupancy rates we think our commercial real estate book by and large is probably one of the best performing segments of our portfolio so were pleased with where it is and a lot of these developers builders borrowers have been with pinnacle now for a long time or with or with their relationship managers for a long time so we feel pretty strongly that our client selection processes have been strong and have been good and so we dont feel necessarily the need to be to be overly concerned that said our credit officers are looking under rocks for everything they can to be prepared should something come up that we didnt expect and theyre having conversations with clients accordingly terry how about you build from there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think i would add two or three things as it relates to commercial real estate in the whole and particularly as it relates to the office portfolio i think one thing steve that amazes people if you go through our largest loans that are being held by special assets people people that work difficult credits i think there are two loans in that top that would be crerelated and so again id just say that you know the phrase the platform is done its your future performance but it certainly is a strong indicator to me that that portfolio has held up so well so far i think one of the reasons that it has is two things one as we underwrote those loans when they went on the books to begin with in the construction phase and so forth we always underwrite with a mortgage cost that that projects a future cost and on what the permanent would take you out at and i would say most of the loans on the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 books would have been underwritten assuming a mortgage cost within the or range so granted that might be a tick below the renewal rates but its not substantially below the renewal rates it was underwritten to perform at that level i think the other thing this might be the most important aspect i like you i mean ive got cnbc on and i watch these disaster stories from markets like san francisco or up east and so forth but in these southeastern markets we use the map we talked about the growth going on in those markets but the rent growth over the last three or four years has really been extraordinary and so that rent growth obviously is what enables those borrowers to absorb the elevated fixed rates and puts us in a good position i think on the idea of the extend and portend every now and then we do as we renew we have people that have to rightsize a credit but if they have to rightsize it they have to rightsize it i mean were not just rolling and hoping for the best they need to do whatever it takes to rightsize that credit so anyway as i say i dont want to overemphasize past performance but it is a comforting thing to me steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats helpful color i want to pivot to the margin so harold i think you said youre assuming four cuts in the guidance is that right harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so if i look at your margin before the pandemic right you guys are pretty routinely at a to range which is way above where you are now if we think about even four rate cuts or five rate cuts well see what the number looks like but the yield curve is starting to steepen from a structural view is there any reason your margin with the more normal curve at this level of rates which is normal wont go back eventually into that range i know itll take time but as these renewals play out you cut deposit costs is there any reason to think over time were not somewhere back in that range harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think thats a great question and we debate that quite a bit as to what we think our longterm net interest margin is and we believe its somewhere in the to range and we get there by based on what our current spreads on on our floating rate credits and then what we think our depositors will will need to pay in relation to fed funds so we think were at to im not hinting at that well get to that this year but at the same time we do believe our margin is in great shape right now we think our balance sheet is in good shape we think we can we can definitely take advantage of what the market will present to us this year provided we can see some call it less steepening in the yield curve operator thank you your next question is pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 a or less conversion operator thank you your next question is coming from casey haire from jefferies your line is live casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey casey m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i wanted i wanted to just follow up again on expenses so just just to clarify this the base im assuming thats off to million which includes the fdic assessment and then just what is the what are some of the factors given its a wide range about percentage points between the high low like what are some of the factors that gets you to the high end of that range versus the low end harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so casey just to be clear what you said million casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yes oh sorry whatever your im sorry whatever gap expenses were in and and basically your guide is based on expenses which includes the fdic assessment correct harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah whats on the whats on the slide would not include the fdic insurance special assessment so with the midtohigh doubledigit you need to take out that special assessment casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay got you all right and then just what what are the some of the factors that get you to the high end versus the low end pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think if we can hit our revenue targets in the way we we think we can i think thatll drive our incentive costs up and that will drive our expense base up i think if we have a strong year in our hiring thatll also thatll also trend our expenses up our expense guidance does include jacksonville so weve embedded that as well in there and weve got weve got high aspirations for what we believe the leader we hired in that market can accomplish operator thank you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think thats it harold harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc okay operator thank you your next question is coming from michael rose from raymond james your line is live michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just a followup on bhg in the press release you mentioned that they exited some businesses can you just discuss what those are and what the kind of the impact was to their kind of origination guidance as we think about thanks harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah they had that buynowpaylater franchise that they were developing i think last year they originated like million in production something like that so that they were winging all off that theyve always experimented with this patient lending franchise i think theyve decided to abandon that as well theres a couple of others that are also on the list that im aware of im not sure where they are with discussions with the people that work in those units but i think theyve had discussions with them im just not sure michael but that is embedded in the production guidance they have for this year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just as my followup back to the margin i think if im doing my math right it implies a pretty steep ramp in nim progression as we move beyond kind of fourth quarter even against your expectations for rate cuts just just wanted to kind of put a finer point on just that progression or earning asset growth if you could thanks pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think we do see nim increases this year i dont know what how fast you have it going up but i think itll be fairly gradual we might have kind of a down the first quarter is going to be a challenging quarter i think after that we ought to see we ought to see we ought to see nim progression that you all ought to be happy with michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks michael operator thank you your next question is coming from brandon king from truist securities your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i noticed hey hey so i noticed that the spot rate for deposits was lower at the end of the year compared to the average for the quarter so is it fair to say deposit costs have already peaked harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think until we get a rate cut formally there will be some deposit creep but it wont be nearly at the pace we saw in all of brandon king q analyst truist securities inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 okay okay and and then on the mix side of things how are you thinking about how the mix shift will trend this year and how does that kind of flow into your assumptions on deposit costs harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question as far as the mix shift out of dda into higheryielding deposit products we still plan to see some more of that but again not like we saw earlier in but we do believe there will be some more attrition out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing products but again not at the same pace operator thank you your next question is coming from matt olney from stephens your line is live matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning everybody just wanted to go back and revisit the outlook and what this implies for the yearoveryear ppnr growth it feels like youre youre trying to say that there will be modest yearover year ppnr growth even with the higher expense guidance but just looking for any clarification around that harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think our planning assumption is that we will i think it will be if you look at what the peers are looking at for next year its a modest atbest kind of year for but we fully intend to outperform the peer group they probably wont be consistent with call it a year prior but at the same time we fully expect to see ppnr and net earnings accretion in matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay appreciate the clarification and then just a followup on bhg i guess i appreciate the i think the guidance you give us there it sounds like cost cutting will be a driver of the of the positive modest positive fee growth there any more color on the moving parts how much how much do you expect the bhg revenues to decline yearoveryear and then for you to hit that kind of guidance you put out there how much do we need to see expenses decline thanks harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah theyve had a pretty significant decrease in the fourth quarter from the third quarter i dont think theyll have that much more here in the next year but they they will see call it some reduction in expenses in comparison to they have a cost cutting exercise in the fourth quarter thatll be the primary contributor to that i think their revenues should shape up to be flattish maybe next year i think theyre optimistic with respect to growth there but the whole idea is to rightsize the franchise and get it more focused on their core products and then get into call it a sustainable growth rate going into operator thank you your next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 yeah thanks i guess my first question is just around the jacksonville expansion i may have missed it but is the belief that this can be billion to billion in asset bank and then with the you also have louisville noted on the map and im wondering if thats just the construct of the map or if thats intentional m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc two things stephen i think in the case of louisville we have started de novo operation there i guess harold help me three or four quarters ago or something like that so its an early stage buildout using the same model that we have market leadership with a long career at wells fargo thats leading our effort there in the case of jacksonville yes we do believe i think you use the number billion to billion generally our target is a billion bank in a fiveyear period of time as you may know generally for these buildouts the we cross breakeven anywhere from four to seven quarters dependent upon how steep or what the trajectory is there but were expecting a pretty rapid buildout in jacksonville that would likely resemble what weve done in dc stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just my followup is around net chargeoff expectations i think it was basis points this year and you said should be consistent with that whats kind of embedded within those expectations in terms of overall economic scenario i mean are we thinking about a soft landing and if things get worse overall that could be could be worse as well or is that just a function of youalls book itself and the strength of your internal book harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes stephen i dont know m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes well go ahead terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc no go ahead harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think ill say yes to all of that i think before we really started to have some conversations with the special asset people we have conversations with the credit officers they feel pretty good about where the book sits today they feel pretty good about what borrowers are doing and how theyre cooperating with us for those that might be under some some kind of special considerations so we dont we dont sense that nor do we sense that i mean its presenting huge challenges for the portfolio at large pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 so we think that was really healthy here this time going into and we believe also that many of the uncertainties that were around this time last year are not nearly as uncertain appreciate that we could have a recession it could be a soft landing and i believe our assertion as to where we think chargeoffs will be in is under kind of a soft landing no recession kind of scenario who knows what happens if we get into a hard landing but anyway i would say yes to all the items that you talked about stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc stephen i dont know about this narrative but yeah i think our assumption is that we are most likely to have a soft landing perhaps a modest recession and given the health and strength and current performance of the portfolio that guidance ought to hold up i think to harolds point do you have a great recession i dont think you ought to assume were going to have basis points in net chargeoffs operator thank you your next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a followup on bhg and just thinking about how to model the revenue for bhg next year if we look back at the size of the balance sheet and the loans that stayed onbalance sheet for bhg that grew a lot throughout and as they are kind of shifting from the gain on sale strategy to more onbalance sheet and of course that goal this year in the balance sheet was basically flat in just given the rate environment how do you think about how that looks as we move through just as we kind of think about how much of originations stay on balance sheet versus how much go out into the bank network or move offbalance sheet in the private sale transaction harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think whats going to happen this year is i believe based on conversations ive had with their cfo you should see more headed into the bank network this year than last year i think it was fairly close to a even split in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 i think theyll try to lean into the bank network a little more this year than last i think they still are planning one or two abs issuances here in they were able to get one accomplished in the fourth quarter which we think was great news for them but yeah i think they will use the bank network with a little more intensity in catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then on just the big picture kind of outlook and just thinking about eps growth and i know youve kind of answered this in potentially different ways but i mean your target for maybe question one is what is the incentive comp in versus i think it started out the year last year so curious what that looks like for this year assuming a full payout and then maybe within that im assuming that even with a full payout that is assuming youre going to grow eps yearoveryear kind of off of a lets call it a number in and so again just want to reiterate there isnt a scenario where youre going to have this kind of middoubledigit expense growth pace and have decline in eps or have midsingledigit revenue growth and just want to kind of clarify how youre thinking about how those two pair together and ultimately what you think is an appropriate eps growth rate to have in to get a full incentive comp pay harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah as we put together kind of our earnings number and ph we have had to do this in the past but i think its probably beneficial to do that were talking low to midsingledigit kind of earnings growth for this year and so with that what we have to do is build a plan that will get our associates their incentive were starting at call it of target and then well tier it upwards to where we think our earnings number needs to be for the year and itll go all the way down to zero as far as payout last year youre right we started at we ended at so basically from what our associates were looking at at the beginning of last year to indiscernible we cut it basically in half for were starting with like a call it payout and that number is somewhere in the million range if we can afford it but youre right the earnings have to show up and if they dont show up that million begins to get less fairly quickly m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine i might jump in and add to harolds comments and i know you know this but i get questions over time which make me believe some people dont understand this but that earnings target that gets set there weve never said it to be less than the top quartile as you know this year top quartile is not all that high but again we are projecting earnings growth here it will be top quartile and that earnings growth that were projecting contemplates the full payout of the annual cash incentive plan and in the event that the revenues dont materialize to produce the earnings at the targeted level the way you pay for that is you frame the incentive expense and so again i think i know there are a lot of companies that have all kinds of incentive plans where if they make some then they pay out all this other stuff but thats not the way it works for us the incentive is built into the earnings projection when the earnings show up we pay it out in the event they dont we retrieve that or harvest that to fuel earnings to the shareholder so i dont know if thats a helpful explanation or not but pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no it is and its certainly what we saw this past year and its just tough in a year where rest of to your point peers in general were forecasting a decline in eps yearoveryear and so top quartile may look really good but if or you may be to have top quartile but you still may be kind of flat eps growth so i was just trying to kind of think about how youre thinking about eps growth and marry that with the full payout to make sure were thinking about an eps target appropriately m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think harold gave it to you didnt he catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah he did i am good very helpful thank you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i got stuck indiscernible operator thank you your next question is coming from brody preston from ubs your line is live brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc harold im sorry to beat a dead horse on expenses i just wanted to put a pretty fine point on it so excluding the fdic surcharge youre at million of expenses for the year if i look at the guidance slide i take kind of mid to highteens to imply to kind of range so the midpoint of that would imply billion number off of your million versus the million to million you gave which is about million so its about a difference there and i was just wondering whats driving the delta between what you said on the call versus whats implied in the deck last night harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thanks brody thats a great question i think our number is more like to first pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so we call that mid to high i think the delta is around payout versus payout and some other things that im aware of in our plan where i think we have some cushions so thats what got me to the million to million number i talked about earlier brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful color i appreciate it and then i did just want to ask on nii a couple of questions and one here harold you said may i think for the first cut first part of the question is could you clarify within your within your nii guidance when the other three cuts you have occurring are and then secondly just when i look at the loan growth guidance and and compare it on an average basis it implies about 11plus percent average loan growth and so i guess im wondering is there the opportunity where you guys can kind of outperform even the highend of the guidance range that youve given just given the low doubledigit average loan growth youre expecting combined with pretty significant fixed rate repricing throughout the year harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think on first of all on the rate cuts and dont hold me to this but i had that question for some people here yesterday i think it was i think weve got embedded july september and november maybe dont hold me to that i think those are kind of splitting the dot plot but anyway ill go with that its just a steady decrease i think along with that you should assume a higher beta on our deposit cost we had a high beta going up we think well have a higher beta going down so we will try to recoup as much of those rate decreases as we can from our deposit book or just try to get as close to as we can as far as loan growth and ill let terry also talk to this as well i think the guardrails we have on loans are related to capital and related to the client deposit growth we cant let the loans just outgrow deposits extended in the fourth quarter we were like million to million something like that we need to push deposit growth up at the same time weve been steadily accreting capital over the last year or two we think thats healthy we think that we will continue to do that but we can absolutely beat the loan growth target that we in the in the on outlook slide brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it could i add just one quick followup i just wanted to followup on brandons question that he had on the spot rate on the interestbearing deposits being below the average for the quarter so if we dont see any i know you said to expect further creep but im just trying to think mathematically if you guys arent raising rates at this point what drives the average up if the spot rate is below where it was for the fourth quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the what could contribute to increased deposit rates are just new accounts new clients trying to move money across the street from somebody else i think that would be one of the primary contributors additionally mix shift could occur primarily around our public fund deposits we think the we believe the bulk of our public fund depositors have already built their balances up but we could see some increase in their balances most of those accounts are indexed and so consequently as they collect property taxes and whatnot that money finds its way to our bank operator thank you your next question is coming from brian martin from janney montgomery your line is live brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey good morning guys harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey just a couple couple of easy things terry just the hiring outlook i think last quarter you talked about it maybe being a little bit better in than is that still your expectation or just kind of especially with jacksonville how are you thinking about hiring in m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think that i think we had a little bit of a reduction in the hiring pace in from i think were likely to migrate back somewhere closer to the level of hiring and to your point jacksonville will be a big contributor to that hiring brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay and i think you guys talked in the slide about some deposit initiatives just to your last point harold about getting the deposit growth you needed for the loan growth are there any new initiatives you have in place or just the ones you talked about in the past harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah its the ones weve talked about in the past pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc terry why dont you take the rest of it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i would say that with a numerator topped about four in the past we introduced three more toward the tail of and my expectation is well probably introduce two or three more over the course of i think the three additional specialties probably the one that holds the most opportunity for us is focused on all manner of escrow accounts whether it be exchanges mortgage escrows attorney firms all those kinds of things but we believe that we have an advantage software capability for people that are running as agent on escrow money we think weve got some advantage software thats helpful there and look for that to be the biggest of these most recent three product specialties that weve introduced and so i think whats important about it brian is two things one the size of the market is huge we have an advantage product which had let us penetrate it well but the second thing thats really important is most of that money is either no cost or low cost money and so thats a powerful specialty that we have brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay thats helpful and just the last one for me guys was just held back on the margin it sounds like first quarter is flattish or stable and then up from there the biggest drivers of that cadence of increase throughout the year is it is it outside of the fixed rate repricing is there something else in there i guess thats the key driver is that it i know you have liquidity drop a little bit this quarter so just trying to understand the the benefits there going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we do have some indiscernible liquidity shrinkage over the course of the year that will be a contributor to the margin primarily not necessarily net interest income but we do intend to be very aggressive on reducing our deposit cost brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think we determined that based on what happened during the covid crisis last year that that and our ability and the fact that we raised rates so aggressively that weve got the ability to lower and i believe a lot of the large caps we are talking about that theyre still trying to catch up on deposit rates well we think were pretty much already there so pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so yeah we fully intend to take advantage of rate cuts on our deposit book brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay perfect thats all for me guys thank you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief
