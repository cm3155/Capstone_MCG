partners is mr terry turner chief executive officer and mr harold carpenter chief financial officer please note pinnacles earnings release and this mornings presentation are available on the investor relations page of their website at wwwpnfpcom todays call is being recorded and will be available for replay on pinnacles website for the next days at this time all participants have been placed in a listenonly mode the floor will be open to your questions following the presentation operator instructions during the presentation we may make comments which may constitute forwardlooking statements all forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other facts that may cause the actual results of the pinnacle financial to differ materially from any results expressed or implied in such forwardlooking statements many of such factors are beyond pinnacle financials ability to control or predict and listeners are cautioned not to put undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements a more detailed description of these and other risks is contained in pinnacle financials annual report on s it seems like they would suggest that youre being somewhat conservative with your assumptions for to basis point rises in rates just given the liquidity that you still have on the balance sheet can you talk maybe about the assumptions that go into your upside for nii and then just talk about what reprice is in the first days on the loan portfolio following a rate hike harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well i think the advantage we got here in the near term is that we anticipate a basis point increase in rates from the fed and so thats going to take a little over billion in loans out from their floors and put them back on what another coupon is but what we do is were talking to our market leaders were trying to anticipate what they think their growth is going to be over the next several quarters and then we just fashion that on out we also look at what our pricing has traditionally been and use that as the forward on the forward curve some people might say its not rocket science but there are a blue million assumptions that go into this forecast and just to get on my soapbox just for a second because i know time is precious the disclosures that we include regarding our asset sensitivity in the back are primarily weighted towards what the regulators generally require and so its a stable balance sheet and a parallel shift in the curve and all those kind of assumptions that go into it and it really lacks a lot of creativity and a lot of ingenuity that were always thinking about around here to improve both the earnings content of our firm as well as what we think our growth is going to be so weve got several levers here that we can pull periodically that helps us either in the near term the short term or the long term and thats what well do and so what we try to do is provide that information thats in that asset sensitivity table but at the same time kind of get you to a realworld kind of growth perspective that we think is going to is more likely brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 okay fair enough appreciate the color congrats on the quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brett operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo jon rau q analyst wells fargo hi this is jon rau on for jared how are you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good jon jon rau q analyst wells fargo i just wanted to go back to the comment earlier in the prepared remarks about line utilization was a benefit this quarter i was hoping you could just quantify how much that increased from the fourth quarter and what the dollar impact of that was and i guess if theres any further for that to go as we move through the year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jon im looking for the slide in the back i think generally well give you that information so i think commercial real estate lines went up the active balances on commercial real estate went up million million on ci so the utilization went up on commercial real estate and on ci m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc so jon just my color commentary in addition to that slide and harolds comments i think you asked at the end if we see an opportunity for that to pick up speed i think the answer to that is yes i mean theres sort of two components to it one is the sort of inevitable fund up of construction loans so that utilization ought to pick up and then secondly in the case of ci my belief is that if the economy moves forward it spins the sales cycle and that results in receivable and inventory financing line utilization and the like so depending upon what your economic outlook is if you think the economy is going to find a good footing you ought to expect line utilization to pick up jon rau q analyst wells fargo okay thats very helpful and then just on the rate hike assumptions does the faster assumption in increases in shortterm rates impact your beta assumptions at all like moving to a basis point hike in may versus kind of spread out throughout the year does that kind of ramp up how quickly you have to pass through that on the depositors pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah our planning would be that initially our beta will be relatively small and that over the course of the rate cycle we increase the beta up meaningfully jon rau q analyst wells fargo okay so the pace of hikes is factored into that now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc for sure yeah jon rau q analyst wells fargo okay great thank you and then sorry just one last one for me on the prepared remarks you talked about six rate hikes being assumed in the guidance but on the slides im seeing six additional hikes throughout the rest of the year i am just wondering if the actual guidance assumes six or seven total for the year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were thinking six more for the rest of this year jon rau q analyst wells fargo okay great so seven total harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes jon rau q analyst wells fargo okay thank you thank you very much thats all for me thanks for answering my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jon operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning just going back to bhg and just awesome loan growth guide for this year just wondering as youve been talking to them and some of the macro clouds have darkened materially yeartodate or at least pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 gotten more uncertain how much discussion has there been internally in terms of okay if we are less comfortable with the environment what would need to happen do we need to narrow the credit box drop guidance on loan growth boost reserves like how much of those discussions have been happening behind the curtain m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the only my exposure to bhg is through their board meetings and we have access to their obviously to their credit people im not sure how much increased diligence i cant really put a measurement on that other than that they are looking at their portfolio statistics theyve added people into their credit units and so on and so forth so they like us have an enterprise wide risk group that is trying to look out and around the corners i dont know if thats exactly giving what you wanted brock but thats where im headed brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thats close enough and separately harold just on your pinnacles reserve guidance weve repeatedly estimated way to the high side in provisioning it sounds like we should be expecting this neighborhood of provisioning near to intermediate term as that reserve continues to trend down am i on target there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so we have a stronger chargeoff forecast for this year in our numbers but i think thats just out of caution when i talk to the credit officers theyre really excited about where the book is weve had now a string of probably four quarters where provisioning has been a lot less than even we anticipated so there may be some elevation towards the back end of the year brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start terry on slide you have quite a few markets where first horizon has really strong market shares im curious based on your experience in these local markets do you see this is a similar opportunity to what happened with truist or do you think this could be even better from a talent acquisition perspective whats your take there pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i would say comparable to be honest with you steven i think you know this i would say if you and im speaking off the top of my head id have to go get numbers to prove it but what i believe is if you looked at over the last five years suntrust would have been the principal benefactor to us in terms of new hires i think when you make it a more recent time period meaning over the last two or three years that evolved to wells being the biggest benefactor for us and so today i think the indiscernible sort of moving back to truist theres lots of vulnerability there and so i dont know my own sense of it is first horizon is probably going to be a comparable thing for us steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then on the next slide terry where you break out this once in a generation opportunity these different markets from a big picture view where do you see the revenue producers moving to in these markets im not looking for an exact number but is this the start of these other markets moving towards atlanta and atlanta continuing forward m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think so theres size differences in those markets and so atlanta and dc are the grand markets just in terms of the total size and growth dynamics and so when we go into those and we hire leadership in those markets part of our discussion centers around how do you think you can build a billion bank over a fiveyear period of time or something and so that would be indicative of what we set out to do in those big markets huntsville and birmingham are meaningfully smaller markets and so the penetration should be similar in those markets maybe even better but the growth opportunity and the number of revenue producers that we hire in those markets will be less but yeah just sitting here today steve i love whats going on in atlanta ill be shocked if we dont run faster in dc than even in atlanta i dont know we just have to see but i am so encouraged by whats going on there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats good color and then finally ill get harold into the mix on deposit rates so the end of period deposit rates were up modestly maybe harold whats going on behind the scenes you have many customers now asking for a higher rate how are the rms handling that and maybe what are you seeing from competitor banks on that front thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean we are first of all were not seeing anything from competitor banks so i dont think competitors are increasing rates of any consequence at all we are getting phone calls from various clients that tend to focus on their rate and we are working with those clients as you might expect us to do and theyre primarily the ones look now we do have several clients that are on an indexed deposit rate pricing scale so they obviously got increased rates but theres a lot of our client base out there the notforprofits and the churches and those kind of businesses where they pay attention to every last nickel and so we expect them to call and you should expect us to work with them so thats whats really going on were not a lot of the operating companies that are around a few are pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 calling but most of the operating companies are more concerned about where theyre going to get their next person to put on the line to drive the truck to do those sort of things steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and based on harold what you expected right from an exception pricing view is it about in line what youve seen so far in terms of the number of requests coming in for exception pricing harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think were doing a little better than i would have thought i would have thought with that basis point rise that we would see more increase on our deposit cost because we look at it every day and we particularly took interest when the fed increased rates basis points so we had some inclination as to what rates would do given the indexed accounts but i think i really do and i meant that in the comment is that my hats off to my relationship managers because i think theyre doing a great job in explaining to our clients where we are in this rate cycle steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you operator our next question comes from michael rose with raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to get an update on how many or how much loans you guys are adding from bhg each quarter and if that would be expected to increase i know they did a securitization in february and could be a little tougher given the environment so just want to get a sense for how much of this quarters growth and then maybe expectations for adding bhg loans are kind of built into the guidance for the year thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah michael i dont think we added any loans in the first quarter from bhg if we added any it was about million and i think what weve always communicated between us and them is that we may look to add million or so this year but im not sure if we added any here in the first quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then maybe just switching to credit quality obviously things are really good but clearly some potential clouds on the horizon if i look at post day one cecl i mean its definitely lower than where the reserve is now and you talk about that going down can you just kind of talk about the countervailing forces there in terms pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 of improving credit metrics versus kind of what could happen out on the horizon and what that could mean for provisions and reserves thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the influence to cecl for us would be that the migration period in the past is gradually moving forward and credit metrics are improving with that so thatll put downward pressure on it and the same thing exists with respect to the forward outlook theres less nearterm kind of macroeconomic pressure on a reserved bill so i think those two things will in combination give us more confidence that the reserve will likely go down than up here over the next at least the next couple of quarters now we dont expect it to get down into the kind of the day one cecl area code we dont think thatll happen but we do think weve got some more room here like i said over the next couple of quarters michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from matt olney with stephens inc matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning and i want to go back to the discussion of the impact of higher rates on the bank and my question is really on new loan spreads and on page you gave us a good summary but with higher rates i know youre hoping to see that flow into the new loan originations im curious with your expectations are for this year it seems like the market is assuming that many of your competitors also have really strong liquidity like pinnacle does like really slow down the list of the new spreads but curious what your expectations are this year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah matt this is harold i think for new loan originations we hope to get kind of a similar spreads to the what the book is currently our planning assumption is that wed likely wont that in order to bring new borrower across the street we probably wont get the loan beta that we anticipate that wed like to get out of our current book so there is some caution built in to what pricing is going to be on the new credit that were looking matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then i guess just taking a step back and thinking about pinnacle rate sensitivity more broadly throughout the cycle it seems like last rate cycle the bank performed pretty well the first half the cycle but then deposit costs accelerated in the back half so i guess what are the expectations for this cycle i mean it sounds like you think that deposit betas could be lower given the higher levels of liquidity but what else should we think about in terms of how the banks balance sheet has changed since a few years ago thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 yeah i dont know if theres a whole lot significant change in how our balance sheet is built as far as on the left side i think our bond book is probably maybe a couple of percentage points bigger than what it was back in the last upgrade cycle obviously this liquidity has influenced how our balance sheet has moved since the last time and i think that gives us some comfort that maybe the deposit beta wont be as significant this time as it was last time but i think beyond the structure of the balance sheet i think just the macro environment here where there is massive liquidity and modest loan demand theres a pretty different phenomenon than what we faced before so i think that will have more impact perhaps than just changes to the structure of the balance sheet matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah okay thats all from me thanks guys operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc terry could you kind of elaborate on your commentary on your optimism for the greater washington dc market and then my second question is on pinnacles buyback appetite right now thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay yeah i think in the case of washington dc jennifer so it just starts with a large market with high growth as you know beyond that for us the whole story is about people and who are the people that you hire and where they come from and who else can they hire and what business can they move and all those sorts of things and so im just its still in early stages as you saw on the slide there the balance sheet volumes have barely scratched the surface there in the first four months but the pipeline is very large and again you cant celebrate until you get it booked but my belief is theyll be successful in getting it booked and theyre off to a really rapid pace on hiring and their pipeline for hiring is also large and so the combination of the people that are there the long pipelines that theyve generated and the hiring pipelines that also are building is the basis for my optimism jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks and the appetite for buybacks at this point harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 yeah jennifer this is harold im not really i dont think were at a point to execute on any kind of buybacks right now one thing that we do consider in buybacks is what our loan growth forecast looks like and so currently it looks like our loan growth is going to be fairly significant and well look at that in relation to capital so right now i think were probably on a hold but obviously if we see more pressure on the stock then we might start wading in and trying to defend the stock with a little more effort jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great thank you so much m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator our next question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys appreciate the time terry im curious just how youre thinking about loan growth from a market expansion standpoint if i do the math on the slide you laid out for the new hires it looks like maybe thats about growth just on their potential so im guessing the next amount to get to the up teens is more market expansion is that a fair way to think about it and how do you see the prospects shaking out from a market expansion standpoint currently harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah stephen i think i might go at it the other way so we dont have specifically market extensions baked into the forecast but when you start compartmentalizing that growth you get growth from new hires and you get growth from existing bankers and the footprint and so thats where that midteen growth would come from is that math the people that we have hired and the people that are sort of legacy lenders here in terms of market extensions i think it is a good question weve tried to it comes up stephen as you know theres always question about ma and so i always try to say look man our opportunity in the markets that were in is so strong its hard to figure out it has to be an overwhelming transaction for ma same thing for market extensions i think we will have more market extension opportunities we have had discussions in a number of markets and just to remind you for us its not about hiring a sales team its about hiring somebody we think can build a big bank in that market and so when we plan those well move and so when you think about where might we move stephen basically we keep going back to this triangle if you go to memphis and draw a line up to dc and down to the state of florida the big major urban markets are the markets wed like to be in and so as we find people we think those big bank will pull the trigger at that point but thats not included in sort of the growth projection stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 okay perfect yeah thats really helpful i probably should have said economic expansion not margin expansion but thats a great answer terry appreciate that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co and then if im thinking about bhg the atlanta expansion i think that was noted in the presentation was that about any extension of their product set or is that just more about being able to tap a new market for talent to run that platform harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think its a little both i think a lot of the people that are part of some of their new products are in atlanta and so they decided to establish kind of a foothold there in atlanta and i think that gives them opportunities to introduce their brand through some more potential employees that have the talents that theyre looking for stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful and then just one more question maybe around bhg and kind of credit outlook as a whole i know you said some of the stuff could change in the back half of the year but with bhg how do you combat maybe some of the investor pushback that just says hey this is more unsecured consumer type of lending this is what we might be worried about if we are in a recession how do you maybe combat that sort of ideology as you think about that book and their business and then if the moodys modeling were to start to shift would that also have an impact on near term where your provisioning could go m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think obviously if moodys were to change their position on where they think gdp and unemployment goes that could be impactful to everybody as to bhg and their credit systems and their borrowers now granted theyve kind of gotten into the shallow end of the pool on point of sale but as far as their traditional business lines theyre lending to consumers at an average ticket sales of so these are not low ticket kind of credits these are credits that are established they believe in their credit scoring system and so these are folks that have legitimate credit histories that they can lean into with confidence so i wouldnt classify it as traditional consumer book based on what i understand traditional consumer books look like these are folks that are focused on different things with respect to use of proceeds so on and so forth stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense well congrats on a great quarter guys and appreciate a lot of the new slides in the deck very helpful stuff pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks stephen operator our next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one followup on just the balance sheet and the margins the cash is sitting at of average earning assets today how do you think about where that ratio moves to through the back half of the year and how that goes into your gaap nii guide harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean we do have some reduction in that but not a lot we think its going to be fairly stable for the rest of the year we are looking at a couple of nearterm products that will give us some exposure on the shorter end of the curve with some floating rate kind of instruments that will maybe give us a little bit of an extra little punch but for all intents and purposes that will be just another cash item thats making a little more money i think technically it will be in the bond book but it will be a shortterm security catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just a picture on credit i mean credit is till good and you were just seeing chargeoffs low and npas decline and reserves are still coming down i feel that theres a big disconnect between what were seeing from the banks and just concerns that we have with investors on wall street any commentary on what you can do today to prepare for any potential increase in credit costs types of credits youre looking more closely at or youre staying away from parts of your book that you think are at relatively higher risk today and things you can do to prepare yourself would be helpful thank you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well like i mentioned before i spent a lot of time with the credit officers particularly the chief credit officer on what kind of diligence theyre about doing today given what forecast looks like regarding inflation and so on and so forth we got a and i think one of the things that gave me some comfort from what tim was talking about to me is that theyre going back into that covid book that we looked at over the last two years revisiting those credits particularly around hotels because probably the first exposure will be to discretionary spending so on and so forth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 and right now they believe that our client selection processes are sound that we feel good that those type credits that are more subject to discretionary spending are looked to be in good shape now past that then you look at all the fuel consumers call it truckers and concrete companies and indiscernible and right now all of them are passing that cost along how long thats going to be able to do that not sure but right now everybody is up to their neck in business opportunities the biggest issue like we talked about is can they find workers catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great its helpful thank you so much great quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator the next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc steve you there he must have dropped operator okay ill move on to the next one our next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery scott brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys hey harold maybe i joined a little bit late but just maybe the last question you talked a little bit about the liquidity it sounded as the last quarter you kind of expected that liquidity to drop a little bit in conjunction with the loan growth is your stance a little bit different this quarter based on just your comments to last question or so that maybe its not going to change all that much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think itll come down but i dont think its going to change a lot catherine noted it might go to something like that i dont think its going to jump itll go down that much brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay all right and then just if you gave it harold maybe i missed it just the timing of your rate increase expectations you said basis points next meeting in may beyond that is it just kind of one day meeting or what harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats right brian pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right and then just the deals on new loans that you guys were getting i know you talked about spreads but just new loan yields today on the commercial side in general can you give any thoughts on those relative to whats coming off the books right now on the books harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i dont think theres a whole lot of big delta between the new loans and the former loans right now were hopeful that we can get some increased rates on the fixed rate credit i think weve been kind of i dont know we just need to probably do a little better on fixed rate lending and what kind of rates were getting on those but other than that i think our spreads are hanging in there there are other issues thats out there that our folks i think are doing a really good job on is this whole libor cessation thing i think our rates that were gathering on indiscernible that the spreads are hanging there its not increasing a little bit so we feel pretty good about that brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thats all i had guys i appreciate it thanks and great quarter m terry turner a president chief executive
