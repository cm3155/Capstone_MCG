financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that im now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you matthew and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning i expect most of you know that we begin every earnings call with this shareholder value dashboard gaap measures first but quickly go to the nongaap measures because personally i find that the nongaap measures provide a clearer picture of the job were doing for shareholders you can see third quarter was a fabulous quarter balance sheet volumes all grew nicely with loans up linkedquarter annualized earning assets up linkedquarter annualized and core deposits up annualized asset quality remains very strong and because theyve historically been the most highly correlated with longterm total shareholder returns the three most important metrics for me are revenue growth eps growth and tangible book value accretion all up nicely again this quarter let me point out the persistent growth in those three critical measures and the doubledigit fiveyear cagrs for the three most highly correlated metrics with total shareholder return obviously im proud of the longterm consistent trajectory of those three measures but i know that even after years of sustained outsized growth there are always some that remain fearful that somehow we wont be able to propel the culture as we grow that the law of large numbers is going to overtake us that somehow those results are primarily dependent upon me or on my partner rob mccabe or some key man that wont always be here as opposed to a simple consistent repeatable model third quarter was another great quarter of outsized growth for our firm but before we review those results in detail well take a minute and make sure everybody understands exactly how that growth comes about and why weve been able to consistently deliver it over time obviously the fact that we serve major markets in the southeast is huge census bureau numbers paint a vivid picture of the tailwind that exists for banks in the southeast it will be very hard for banks in shrinking northeast west and midwest markets to match our growth but more important than the size and growth dynamics is the competitive landscape here were plotting the share gains and losses for us and the other market share leaders in tennessees four urban markets over the last decade were blessed to do business in markets where we consistently take share from vulnerable competitors whove dominated the market heretofore we entered the north carolina south carolina and virginia markets in with our acquisition of bnc we specifically targeted the carolina and virginia markets to some extent because of the size and growth dynamics but more importantly because we wanted to compete against those same vulnerable competitors with whom we have successfully competed in tennessee so you can see here that share is concentrated among those same vulnerable banks and there for the most part theyve established a track record of consistently giving it up which is why the competitive landscape is the most important contributor to our ongoing growth even more than such impressive size and growth dynamics heres what the share client look like in our first market nashville tennessee according to the fdic deposit share statistics now firmwide assets are over billion and you can see that we have a lead share position in nashville with roughly more share than our next closest competitor an astounding position as most of you pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 know were a commercially focused bank so this is the commercial market share data according to greenwich for businesses with sales from million to million in nashville there in the middle you can see that we have a lead bank share more than our next closest competitor weve been executing the same playbook across the state of tennessee first with the de novo start in knoxville back in followed by acquisitions in chattanooga and memphis both in you can see the remarkably similar growth in all three markets in following our acquisition in memphis we were number on the fdic chart in the most recently released fdic data we climbed to number three in chattanooga where we were in the fourth position in terms of fdic share following our acquisition in today were number two rapidly closing on number one and in knoxville from a de novo start of were now number four on the fdic chart a similar position to where we were at the same tenure in nashville and like nashville were number one in terms of the commercial market share as measured by greenwich as i mentioned a minute ago we acquired bnc in here you can see the dramatic transition we made in the carolinas and virginia with a loan cagr and a deposit cagr since the acquisition importantly on the right you can see the growth in commercial deposits when we apply pinnacles simple consistent and repeatable model just like the urban markets of tennessee were executing the same playbook across the carolinas and virginia and in we began a number of de novo market extensions in the large southeastern markets like atlanta dc and jacksonville florida all with similar growth dynamics and a competitive landscape to that in nashville ive already demonstrated the trajectory that we had in nashville over our 24year history there where we are still taking share by the way you can see the largest markets on the left that the deposit growth is even more rapid than it was in the startup period in nashville and even some of the smaller markets on the right using a simple consistent repeatable model it appears were replicating our startup pace in nashville there as well so yes we have the added benefit of operating some of the best markets in the us frankly its even more important that the share leaders in those strong southeastern markets are vulnerable offering us a once in a generation opportunity but the hedgehog strategy here is to attract and retain the best bankers in the market leveraging our awardwinning work environment using our differentiated recruitment model we create a laser like focus on revenue and eps growth for every single noncommissioned associate in our firm using our win together lose together incentive plan and then for roughly years virtually every year weve targeted top quartile revenue and eps growth in order for management and associates to earn their incentive at target think about that an ability to continually attract the best bankers in the market and allowing nearly all roughly associates to produce top quartile revenue and eps growth with one simple annual cash incentive plan it is simple consistent and repeatable not luck or happenstance this nice and recognized culture continues to propel itself with pinnacle just listed last quarter as fortunes third best place to work in america among finance and insurance firm and its pervasive in most markets we are perennially the best place to work with memphis and nashville repeating again just last quarter as investors i know most bankers will try to convince you that their people are the best that their people are their most valuable asset so im not going to try to convince you that im going to let our clients do that on the left this is our business clients and our eightstate footprint indiscernible relationship managers and how they relate to those vulnerable banks with the larger share in these southeastern markets we literally have amassed the best talent in southeast from a business clients perspective according to greenwich and as you would expect highly valued relationship managers produce better financial outcomes over the longterm pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 on the right you can see how our associates compare to our primary southeastern competitors in terms of ppnr per associate a critical test of effectiveness attracting the best talent has enabled us to build a national reputation for an unmatched client experience both among consumers and businesses both in terms of people and systems which resulted in peerleading longterm value creation its about our ability to consistently and repeatedly grow earnings you can see on the topright tsr leadership its not a new phenomenon and its true across and year time frames and if you look at the eps growth across the bottom of that chart our earnings growth has substantially outpaced peers for a decade and nobody is close and so to put a bow on all that in this one chart you see our unusual ability to consistently attract and retain market best talent and their ability over time to consolidate their clients and associated loan and deposit volumes we validated this model any number of times over the years averages are dangerous so nobody is average everyones above or below average but on average it takes relationship managers about five years to consolidate their books it generally comes in on a roughly straight line basis and when consolidated its roughly the selffunded book in the million range on both sides of the balance sheet you can see on the left that we currently have a total of sic relationship managers that are at various stages of consolidation and within that five year consolidation startup period and on the right you see the extraordinary loan and deposit volumes that we believe well land on our balance sheet just in and if these cohorts of relationship managers continue the consolidation of their books over the next two years at the average pace and ive already told you its our expectation that well layer in another large cohort next year and the year after that and so on producing an incrementally laddered volumes its a simple consistent repeatable model and so as harold walk you through our third quarter results hopefully youll able to see these factors that underlie not only our historical success but our third quarter success and our ongoing success for that matter that our culture continues to strengthen as we grow not diminish and that this persistent growth model is not dependent upon me or other key leaders its not dependent on the change of administrations its not even meaningfully dependent on a more vibrant economy although a vibrant economy with strong loan demand would very likely enhance our growth our remarkably persistent growth even in difficult times is the result of this very simple consistent and repeatable model so harold will walk us through the quarter in greater detail harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everyone we will start with loans which increased by million during the quarter or linked quarter annualized when we consider just cni and owner occupied commercial real estate our loan growth in these two critical segments was approximately million or linked quarter annualized were modifying our growth expectations for to now reflect a range of to growth we were obviously pleased with loan growth this year its been an uncertain environment all year long and there is quite a bit of uncertainty currently but with the election coming up and what appears to be the initiation of a down rate cycle both of these matters tend to point to somewhat less uncertainty in the near future which hopefully creates calmness and brings out the users back to the borrowing type pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 as to our end of period rates particularly sofrbased loans end of period rates are beginning to reflect the fed decrease by quarter end more on loan and deposit betas in just a second one of the keys to our financial plan all year long has been increasing pricing on the renewal of fixed rate loans as the top right slide indicates were expecting about billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan portfolio during the fourth quarter of this year with an average yield of around we believe yield lift of nearly basis points is reasonable as these cash flows come to us during the fourth quarter our competitive advantage is that approximately of our revenue producers have been with us less than two years all of them are ready continue to move market share which bodes well for us as we begin our planning processes for we will continue to lean on our new lenders as we enter for the fourth quarter and head into deposit growth has been a real bright spot for us all year excluding brokered we increased deposits by million in the third quarter were also pleased with noninterest bearing deposits and their performance in the third quarter again signaling that we are finally beginning to see volume growth for dda accounts even our third quarter deposit growth we are maintaining our deposit volume forecast with somewhat more specificity around a to growth estimate we continue to move deposits into the index deposit product area almost of our deposits are now indexed to fed funds as we prepare for a down rate environment this should be helpful as we have said before we continue to like our competitive position as to deposit rates and believe it gives us more flexibility to our current rate indiscernible materialize which includes two additional basis point rate cuts in the fourth quarter weve included an information on betas thus far for loans and deposits we are very pleased with how loan and deposit pricing has performed over the last few weeks as our relationship managers have been diligent in making sure that were able to reprice our deposits as quickly as we can to offset the impact of a lower rate environment on our earning assets so far our deposit beta has outperformed our loan beta and we remain optimistic that we can continue to mitigate the impact of rate cuts by the fed to both our net interest margin and more importantly our net interest income as we move through the next several quarters as expected with the investment securities restructuring late last quarter we did anticipate nim expansion and are pleased with the we posted this quarter our outlook for the fourth quarter is that we believe our nim will be flattish as we consider the incremental rate cuts we are modifying our outlook for net interest income growth for just under growth for we know everyone is thinking about net interest income as we are the yield curve will have a significant influence on how all of that plays out next year so we are running a lot of rate scenarios currently we believe all banks perform better with the traditional yield curve and i believe all of us are optimistic that the rest of the existing inverted curve continuing are in fact decreasing a traditional curve commercial clients coming back with increased energy to borrow again and national elections in the rearview mirror we believe all point to a better operating environment for growth indiscernible were again presenting our traditional credit metrics we mentioned one million chargeoff of cni accretive in the press release last night we performed an indepth review of that credit during the quarter electing to charge off a portion of the credit in place to remain on nonaccrual resolution we hope will occur next year as the company seeks a permanent take out part as to our outlook for charge offs were narrowing our guidance to a pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 range of to basis points for we are also narrowing indiscernible provisioning in relation to average loans to a range of to basis points no real change in how we feel about credit as we head into the fourth quarter or for that matter our charge for past dues classified loans and potential problem loans indicate were performing near historic lows which should be a meaningful indicator as to when we believe credit is coming we have no reason to believe this wont continue to perform well as we head into the fourth quarter as well as into more about commercial real estate and again in the supplementals theres more information on commercial real estate primarily from a multifamily industrial and office as we noted in the press release we have now successfully dropped the lower part of for construction loans to total risk based capital at september which was sooner than we thought last quarter our appetite has changed modestly now that were below the threshold that said and let me stress any new commitments to this space continue to prioritize strategic client relationships only and that we will proceed cautiously we anticipate that our construction concentration will fall further over the next several quarters into the range and we dont expect to see any incremental lift in the concentration until midtolate beyond all that we are currently tracking to achieve our target for total nonowner occupied commercial real estate multifamily construction in mid candidly we have always admired our commercial real estate book the last couple of years have been a rollercoaster of negative media attention around cre and the impact on regional banks i know many of you know this for pinnacle our house limits are very modest we pride ourselves on granular book our largest ticket sizes for our bank or conservative in comparison to what we hear from other franchises thus far for pinnacle our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very well and we expect that to continue now indiscernible and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding the loss on the sale of securities in the second quarter fee revenues were up to in our wealth management units have had a strong year and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue into the fourth quarter and into the fees associated with deposits are also doing quite well with commercial analysis leading the way as to run rates in comparison to the second quarter during we realized an increase of about million from the sale of fixed assets and approximately million in increased fair value adjustments from several of our other equity investments as to our outlook for we are again raising guidance for our fee revenues excluding bhg from to to a range of to growth over last year which seems reasonable given the performance of several of our primary business lines this year expenses came in slightly more than where we thought they would be as of the end of the second quarter importantly we are increasing our incentive target to a target payout for fiscal year again were raising our target with indiscernible to our belief will be better than we thought as of the end of the last quarter as you know direct linkage between our financial performance and our incentive plans are correlated and thus we cant raise one without believing the other will move up as well additionally our hiring was really strong in third quarter with new revenue producers compared to for the first six months of the year going into the fourth quarter our recruiting pipeline remains strong across the franchise lending related expenses are up quarteroverquarter primarily due to a million new recurring charge related to the loss protection fee from the credit default swap we executed in the second quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 as we look to the fourth quarter we currently estimate our total indiscernible expense level for should approximate the third quarter level now to bhg and we will be quick as the slide indicates originations picked up again in the third quarter with originations approaching billion as for the fourth quarter bhg production should be somewhat consistent with the third quarter as to placements total placements were less than originations which was consistent with the second quarter bhg continues to build inventory in order to fill larger orders in the fourth quarter and as we enter also there remains great demand for bhg paper both from our office platform and the institutional buyers more than unique bank borrowers acquired loans over the trailing months and the number of banks eligible to purchase loans from bhg continues to grow as the spreads auction platform spreads increased to in the third quarter balance sheet spreads have remained fairly consistent with the prior quarter all in bhg believe spreads are holding in what has been a higher rate environment bhg believes as rates decrease now the good news for them both a volume and a rate perspective off balance sheet substitution losses amounted to in the third quarter up from in the second as a result bhg increased reserves for off balance sheet losses to the good news is that past dues are trending in the right direction which hopefully is a sign of a better credit experience in the not so distant future on balance sheet losses were up modestly to in from again even though the percentage of all balance sheet losses increased in the third quarter the actual dollar amount for all balance sheet losses decreased a similar indiscernible has occurred in the prior two quarters as balances fell faster than national losses which is why the percentage loss was higher our bhg fees amounted to approximately million in the third quarter and we expect the fourth quarter to approximate that amount our concluding thoughts on bhg this time around are that the management is focused on building the sustainable franchise and as such pushing as much product through the pipe is not as important as maintaining and building an even stronger balance sheet we believe bhg remains one of the most profitable and dynamic fintech models in the country and with an even stronger balance sheet bhg should be an even stronger competitor in the future now to our outlook for the remainder of again weve raised our expectations in some cases and lowered our expectations in others in the end we feel more confident about our outlook given our strong performance in the third quarter all of this should be a good sign for weve started our annual planning effort for next year our financial goals will be the same top quartile revenue and top quartile earnings the investments weve made in our new markets and our indiscernible success are the building blocks we will lean into as we build our plan as i mentioned earlier if we can get beyond an inverted yield curve and our ownermanager clients getting more confidence and start borrowing again for growth im confident will be another strong year for pinnacle weve been through a lot of information so i dont want to spend a whole lot of time wrapping up as we move in the qa we are very fortunate that we operate in what we believe the best banking markets in the united states and in markets where we believe our large competitors are vulnerable and given up market share as they shy away from relationship based banking and the impact that has on delivering differentiated level of service pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 we have also over the years become an employer of choice our recruiting efforts have helped tremendously out of success of our brand in all of our markets no longer do our market leaders have to spend hours introducing our brand to our prospective associates as brand awareness has already found its way into our markets in and outside of the world our best place to work and work environment results resonate among not only our associates but also potential recruits and that translates to a very successful client experience and ultimately to our shareholders in the end we are focused on earnings growth revenue growth and tangible book value growth top quartile performance is the goal year in and year out we believe if we consistently hit these financial goals as well as our strategic goals our shareholders will be rewarded and matt with that we will open up for qa question and answer section operator certainly everyone the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions your first question is coming from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning wanted to start with slide and just talking about the flattish margin expectations for given the beta performance that youve seen so far with loans and deposits and the fixed rate loans repricing in im a little surprised margin expectations arent a little better for at least the fourth quarter can we just walk through again kind of your expectations for the fourth quarter betas loans and deposits and maybe how you see some of those sofr tied loans performing in harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sure ill try to get at it this way as to the margin itself we think that will be fair will be flattish i think as we get deeper into rate cuts well have better opportunities for some balance sheet hedges to take to come into play but that wont occur until we get like past basis points so were still got some heavy lifting to do with our client base over the next call it basis points basis points on rate cuts if that make sense so well have to still work on depositors pretty hard here over the next few months just to get to a point to where some of these balance sheet hedges kick in and we get some kind of a call it a mini cavalry shows up as to net interest income we still expect to see some growth next quarter and so we dont expect that to be flattish but we do expect the nim to kind of be flattish for the year brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful harold and then just thinking about one of the pushbacks i tend to get is like hey you guys have obviously done a great job moving a lot of deposits to being indexed but the loan portfolio is fairly variable with over repricing fairly quickly do you guys think the margin i know you got a lot of things to think about and its maybe not fair to ask until we know what the yield curve looks like in a quarter or two but just thinking about timing maybe versus liability sensitive versus asset sensitive is it fair that the margin to be lower in a pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 quarter or two from here or do you think you can outrun maybe some of the loan repricing as betas matriculate through that sofr portfolio in particular harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well we do believe weve got the opportunity to kind of keep the margin where it is theres obviously going to be some risk that the margin does go down but it wont be a lot it might be a basis point or two but again what were going to have to do is rely on our relationship managers to continue to communicate with their clients to be able to reduce these lower into these lower rate categories and thats what were going to do by pushing a lot of deposits into the index thats obviously a tailwind for that so i guess ill stop there brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then if i could sneak in one last one just around dda you know impressive in your prioryear growth versus average any seasonality in the dda this quarter and just maybe any comments around your efforts to grow that bucket which the whole industry is focused on harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think there is seasonality we dont think thats all the story for the third quarter and we dont think itll be all the story for the fourth quarter in order to attract those deposit accounts noninterest bearing you got to get the entire client relationship and weve been successful in a lot of our new markets in attracting that and pulling that critical product across the street and so thats where we think were going to get some lift as we move forward in not only atlanta but also dc and jacksonville m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc brett if i might just add if you look at greenwich data i would say our lead bank penetration is extraordinarily high versus all our competitors which is a way to say that the class business class view us to be their lead bank which means we got their operating accounts and so again were adding clients at a pretty dramatic pace taking share so from indiscernible thats the biggest thing that were doing relative to growing the dda to market share brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great you certainly taken a lot of market share over the years thanks for all the color guys harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc great operator thank you your next question is coming from russell gunther from stephens your line is live russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hey good morning guys you spent some time in prepared remarks in the slides discussing how successful youve been in terms of ma and then organically taking share from there into the carolinas into memphis is that a strategy today that still makes sense or is of interest to you could you just touch on your thoughts there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc let me clarify the question youre asking do we have an appetite for ma russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah thats right i mean we spent some time on the deck going through the success youve had there and then the next slide taking organic share from there is that part of the strategy going forward m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what i would say is its unlikely i never say never but i think it is very unlikely that well be acquiring banks and i think youve heard me say before the reason for that is our ability to hire so many people our ability to do these market extensions and grow so rapidly with a significantly lower risk profile than doing that vision because i dont think its likely we will make acquisitions russell i think one other point id hope to make is okay we entered some of these markets by way of acquisition but the organic growth that we put on it the pace of that organic growth was substantially beyond what those companies were doing when we acquired them so it really does drive to illustrate the power of this simple model of hiring the best bankers in the market having them consolidate their books of business from where they were to here is a really reliable growth mechanism so because of that i dont think you ought to have much expectation well be acquiring banks russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc understood okay appreciate your thoughts there guys and then just one more for me switching gears if i could to bhg appreciate the thoughts on the trend but as we think about the comment that lower rates should be better from a volume and rate perspective and past dues trending in the right direction is it reasonable to think that revenue could grow in or are there big picture things you could share in terms of the revenue trajectory going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah russell ill try to work my way on the question we really dont want to give out too much numbers but weve had conversations with bhg as to their expectations for next year i would imagine that is probably going to be a midsingle to high single digit kind of number when we finally get to it but weve got more work to do there and weve got some weve got a lot of kind of work to do around what their expense base will look like and so forth for next year russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc got it okay guys thank you very much for taking my question pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you russell operator thank you your next question is coming from jared shaw from barclays your line is live q hi this is ph john rowe on for jared harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi ph john q i guess just sticking to bhg for a second the reserve for on balance sheet losses has been coming down i guess the last few quarters but the liability for substitution and prepayments look like thats still trending up i guess why wouldnt these be moving in the same direction and i guess is there any color on where that liability for substitution and prepayment could be at a good level here harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ph john ill give you a couple of things to think about one is a substitution the loans that are better that have been sold out to the community bank network are the responsibility of the community bank so bhg there is some lag in how those losses come down versus the loans they have on their own balance sheets secondly those loans are likely have longer tenure so the losses related to the own balance sheet loans are newer and they typically see most of the loss content within the first months so this tail thats going on with the off balance sheet has to do with some of these losses of loans that have been around for quite a while as well as the community banks so making them back nearly as time q okay thanks thats really helpful so i guess maybe we can think of the on balance sheet credit trends as somewhat of a leading indicator of the off balance sheet credit trends harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we believe so we believe initially the off balance sheet will replicate with the on balance now the reserves associated with them are calculated in two different ways one is a ceclbased reserve and the other is the trailing loss content with emphasis on the trailing q pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 okay great thats really good color and then i guess just one other one for me moving over to the hiring it sounds like is going to be a pretty big year for bringing on new hires as you kind of deepen your presence in the some of the expansion markets can we still expect the new hires to ramp up in terms of bringing on loans and deposits at the same pace as the some of the initial hires or was there sort of a diminishing return that we should expect as you kind of add to the total number of rms in the market m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah my belief is that the assumptions that we used in that illustration are good assumptions on a goforward basis and the reason i say that is you might guess weve tested this model a lot of different times and it almost always comes back to numbers that resemble what were showing you there in terms of you can see the build up from when people have been here one year when theyve been here two when theyve been here three when theyve been here four and so forth and those are the current those that associates or relationship managers those are the today at whatever late stage of consolidation theyre in and so yeah we believe that for them to move forward at the average run rate is a good assumption am i answering what you asked q yeah that was exactly it thank you so much okay operator thank you your next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning just a clarifying question around the move in index deposits i know harold you touched on this a little bit last quarter as well but how exactly are youre getting those customers to move from negotiated to index and do you think that this creates any sort of pressure on potential outflows as rates presumably move lower in the future harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well its i think what were doing were doing it with individual clients taking them out of the negotiated rate bucket into the index rate bucket i dont think theres any increased risk for clients to leave us based on rate that we will lower the rates and that did not change but in any way so i think what weve got to do is lean into this relationship that our folks have with these clients and i think weve got great confidence when they not not seeing a lot of outflows there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steven one of the things that you remember some of the conversations that we had back when it seemed apparent we were headed into a down rate cycle i think we gave indications that we had already begun prepping both our services particularly our associates and also our clients for how we would respond in the down rate environment and so inside the company there is great understanding by our relationship managers which is you know the whole key to both how we get business and how we keep businesses thats the relationship they have with those clients pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 so as harold said those are one off negotiations were not sneaking up on somebody any of those kinds of things so it would not seem to me that there is much risk of attrition stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co fantastic thats helpful and terry i mean you guys added in a lot of great slides in the deck this quarter and clearly like you showed across and nothing changed across nothing changed the growth profile is still what it is but as you continue to look more and more like one of the large regional banks that youve kind of taken a lot of the personnel from through the years how do you continue to outperform them so significantly or how do keep yourself from starting to look like a large regional bank is it really just the incentives and the culture or is there anything in particular that keeps you from i dont know centralizing in the ways that they have that becomes an impediment m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats a great question so first of all i think start with the culture everybodys said youve been around what a long time even before you showed up people were saying terry you cant indiscernible culture as you get big but the truth is if you we do an internal work environment survey here we have of our associates fill it out if youre not familiar with those estimates i dont think youre going to find anybody that would have that kind of engagement with their associates so that they would give you the feedback and beyond that the answers that they give are in always above in the top bars rating in other words as they rate their level of agreement those numbers have been consistent over a long time theyre not getting worse any of those kinds of things that specifically were moving up the chart on things like best place to work among millennial best place to work among women and as i said in the presentation theyre best place to work among financial services third best behind american express and synchrony those things are getting better not worse and so i just i dont mean to go and on about it but i just want to say that the culture theres no doubt that i and others have an important influence over you could screw it up if you wanted to but it does more or less propel itself once it has the power once its rooted in so forth it propels itself so i think the culture will continue to help us i think our geographic focus will continue to help us ive got peers that are smaller than me that have gone to a lot of business organizations and so forth i get it thats how all the big companies do it and so if your goal is i want to be a big company then you do that thats not really our goal what were trying to be the best were trying to offer a distinctive client experience and thats the motivation to keep it geographic it will get bigger in my opinion because we got all these market expansion opportunities and we can take share from these people and so forth but my belief is that we ought to continue to take share one of the things i was trying to get across because so many people steve and your question there are skeptical i mean low large numbers dont get those guys they cant keep growing that thing at that pace you know we do keep growing at that pace and its just a really simple thing were able to attract bankers from other banks who leave those banks and come over here and bring their clients with them man i wish i had some really sophisticated thing that weve thought up some hightech fintech cool thing we aint got it what we do is we just have a great place to work that people want to leave other big companies to come here and bring their clients and so you can see were hiring people at a dramatic pace thats not slowing down is picking up speed and so again not to ramble on too much but just my whole communication is at least as i see pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 it i dont think the low or large numbers going get us im not saying it wont get you years years years down the road i dont know about that but as far as i can see it doesnt look like the low large numbers are going to get us it doesnt look like culture is going to disappear all those kinds of things stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect terry thanks for the comprehensive answer thats fantastic and congrats on all the continued success m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you for calling comprehensive operator thank you your next question is coming from ben gerlinger from citi your line is live benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning how are you doing ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc doing well appreciate it also really appreciate slide i know you touched on it quite a bit i think its really just illustrative of kind of the dna you guys have like when you look at it roughly onesixth of the bank isnt there yet like you have the people but you dont have the loans so its kind of just shows that like even if you stopped hiring you should still ramp up pretty materially it kind of leads into my next question is when you think about like most banks manage both sides of balance sheets left and right with rates where you guys you have so much growth potential i think its much more of the come in the calculus is what are you putting on rates and deposits thats come on so more so kind of curious of the people youve hired im sure its more ci oriented but when you think about the clients that theyre bringing over is there a general mix of deposits or what we should kind of expect for relationships coming over between loans and deposits im sure theyre obviously franchise additive but thats a huge part of the margin outlook going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ben thats a great question i think we do emphasize ci and private bankers i think we have a general belief that commercial real estate lenders weve got those with wellheeled there with our capacity there so we are interested in private bankers and ci lenders and i think they bring just a general mix depending on what market theyre in if youre in a market like huntsville or bowling green or louisville so on and so forth then youre going to have a broader client base than say if youre a ci lender in atlanta or jacksonville or dc say so i think it just all depends but the calculus that we use is pretty much consistent that were looking for that person to bring a significant amount of their book from their former employer over to our bank and to do that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 within a reasonable time period so we keep up with that we try to make sure if somebody needs help we give them the help to do that otherwise were saying go get them m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc ben i might just add to that i think as ive said in my comments averages are always dangerous because nobody is average everybody is above or below but on average its a pretty selffunded book its about million on both sides of the balance sheet over a fiveyear period of time that these relationship managers bring and harold brought there that includes some private bankers it includes some commercial bankers and large business bankers small business bankers and so forth but thats sort of how the average works it is a self funded book and theres you do have to provide energy and emphasis around deposits to your point the biggest riddle for a company like ours is always how do you fund the balance sheet when you can produce assets at the pace we can but if you take a look at something like dc which is a really large highgrowth market that were building miles an hour that thing is more than selffunded and so anyway im just rambling to say generally people are consolidating their whole relationship and that includes both sides of the balance sheet benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you no thats helpful also kind of just dovetailing off of that like with the additional hires i know you gave guidance but this flywheel isnt stopping if anything its speeding up is it fair to kind of assume doubledigit hires equals double digits expense growth next year or is there any sort of initiatives behind the scene or synergies that there are obviously some synergies just like scale but anything kind of leverpulling on you guys side of the table where you could kind of mitigate some of the expense growth harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc we can always do things to slow down the hiring i dont think well do that the biggest impact that we will have to our expense growth next year will be where we end up in the incentive pool this year and how much more it will take us to get back to target next year because we will load the expense target for next year the expense growth number at target and that will be the biggest influencer of how much growth well have next year or at least in the first part of the year m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc ben if i could say this and obviously somebody is going to take this comment the wrong way but ill just say this we generally take great pride in if you look at our noninterest expense growth over a decade over two decades over the last five years whatever its a doubledigit expense growth rate we just grow the revenues faster and so again to the point you hit out which is really important to me is like you look at all those people that have yet to consolidate their whole growth rate ive got of that expense run rate with the revenue coming and so again as long as we believe were going to continue to hire people and theyre going to continue to move those books of business which i do then you dont fear elevated noninterest expense growth rate were really concerned about revenue growth and eps growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah that makes sense i appreciate indiscernible bankers because theyre doing a great job its a high class problem to have indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you operator thank you your next question is coming from anthony elian from jpmorgan your line is live anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning in the prepared remarks you commented that if the yield curve slopes more favorably in the coming quarters that could lead to a better revenue outlook but if the yield curve doesnt become more positively slope than it currently is for example if loan rates continue to decline to what degree would that impact the optimism you have for next years revenue outlook harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc tony thanks for the question i think youre getting at why we want to try to pursue as neutral balance sheet as we can and you know this as well as i do indiscernible assumptions that go into that but life just gets harder with an inverted curve and has been hard over the last couple of years in dealing with that and trying to manage the spread target over the last couple of years we think were advantaged because of the neutrality of our balance sheet we think we can manage through it if the inverted curve continues to just kind of lag along during but we can always be hopeful and it looks like that weve got some reason to be hopeful of that at some point in and when we talk about an inverted curve just to be candid were talking about from the overnight rate to probably around five years so if we can get a traditional sleep curve there we think thats good news for us and probably a lot of bankers as well anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then my follow up on slide just going back to slide the cumulative growth capacity there you highlighted in deposits and loans for and do the numbers you have on the bar the billion and billion for loans represent the blue sky scenario that you expect to come on to the balance sheet over the next two years or is that just an average basis of what you expect could be recognized on the balance sheet thank you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think its more indicative of an average were not prepared yet to kind of give you any sort of outlook on other than what weve talked about in the prepared remarks anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you your next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw your line is live pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning one follow up on just the nii outlook i mean if you have the ability to grow the balance sheet at a doubledigit pace into next year is there any reason and i know its all maybe dependent on the yield curve but i mean is there any reason to believe that we cant grow nii at a doubledigit pace as we move into next year or is it safer to kind of do this highsingle digit level that we saw in harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc catherine for us there is strong correlation to loan growth percentage growth as well as nii percentage growth probably because the way our margin performs and how tight it is but i think if you look out over the last several years they would be closely correlated so were not ready to put out kind of a loan growth target for next year but we are optimistic that we should do better than what were doing this year catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great and then on fees that was a really great beat this quarter and kind of higher guide for can you talk little bit about especially ive noticed your service charges are coming in higher and im assuming this is just account growth but just any kind of commentary there and then maybe your outlook for growth in service charges and in this quarter or maybe i can even say like in the back half of fee run rate is there anything that feels elevated that we need to be aware of to kind of pull back as we model harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well we touched on it a little bit in the comments around some fair value adjustments for other equity investments and some gain on sale of fixed assets that are in the third quarter that we dont know what the fourth quarter is going to show up as but were not planning on that kind of those numbers repeating going into we think the core businesses ought to grow at a reasonable rate next year whether it be wealth management or mortgage or what have you we will have a full year of growing revenues next year as well so were optimistic about where fees could be next year as far as deposit service charges a lot of it was related to our commercial analysis accounts and if youve been indiscernible a long time like we have the devils in the details and its going back through that file and making sure that youre getting paid the right fees for the right service levels and weve done a lot of that over the course of the year negotiating with clients that use a lot of treasury management to make sure that were getting paid a fair price for what were delivering catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great all right thank you for the commentary great quarter indiscernible operator thank you your next question is coming from sam varga from ubs your line is live samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hey good morning i just wanted to indiscernible specifically the investment services line item and i just wanted to i guess ask for some commentary on what you think the run rate is here it seems like based on just the aum numbers youre getting better at monetizing that again and so i wanted to see if some of that is impacted by private banker hires or just how to think about that business level over the next couple of years even m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes its very much impacted by hiring and the ability of those recent hires to bring their books of business to pinnacle we run a dual platform with raymond james so theyre the backbone to that but its getting theyve transferred to our platform and particularly like in jacksonville weve had great success in jacksonville with recent hires and so we fully intend to see that line item continue to grow is that what you were after sam operator sam your line is live samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc im sorry i might have been on mute there so as you bring the private bankers over i guess how quickly do the brokerage accounts come over as well m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc so let me make sure i clarify so we have private bankers that typically most typically control the relationship and then we hire brokers and we hire trust administrators that both are involved in product specialties that were generally paid as a function of whatever the assets under management are and so were hiring across all of those fronts the private bankers the brokers and the trust administrators i think on that investment services line thats primarily about the commissions which of that commission income is an advisory fee its not transaction commissions its an advisory fee and so again weve been extraordinarily successful with the brokers that weve hired the series licensed brokers consolidating both indiscernible and i think in jacksonville where weve been less than months they have brought a number of like million in assets and so again just give you some sense man you can drive revenues up pretty quickly when youre making those kinds of hires and so were hiring like that all over the footprint samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for the clarification just one last one really quickly on the bond book harold i guess can you comment on seems like you have more variable rate now are you hoping to keep that bond book shorter or are you hoping to extend it out a little bit to capture sort of the background of the yield curve harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think we like where it is currently sam i dont see us growing it i dont see the duration extending on it we are picking up quite a bit of yield out of it where it is i think when we looked at variable versus fixed when we acquired a lot of those hedges to convert it more to variable we got a lot of running room in front of us before but pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 particularly with respect to where rates go if rates continue to fall weve got still quite a bit of yield that we can pick up before rates fall to a level to where the fixed rate decision would have been a better decision if you can follow that that sounds like a lot of words sam but at the end of the day were picking up quite of bit of yield out of that variable rate bond book and well continue to pick up that yield until rates fall quite a bit samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you harold i appreciate it operator thank you your next question is coming from brian martin from janney montgomery your line is live brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys couple quick ones for me just harold on the margin just on the loans that reprice immediately with rates can you remind us what that is harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc the loans that say that again brain the loans that reprice immediately brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc with rate cuts what will move immediately as rates cut on the loan side i know you talked about the fixed rates that are going to continue to move higher but just in terms of rates declining on the variable rate loans kind of the variable rate loan percentage harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc indiscernible credit will reprice immediately and thats about are you looking for variable rate brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so that would be probably about of the variable rate loans its about of total loans brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc theyre repriced daily brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc daily got you okay perfect and then just one question i know youre not commenting a lot about the loan growth outlook but just in terms of just in terms of the mix like this year weve seen that the focus on reducing the cre exposure as we look to next year does the mix of loan growth looks similar or should i guess it seems like it would include a bit more from your comments earlier harold that cre maybe at the back half of next year of or just how we should be thinking about that in terms of your comments also about maybe looking for a little bit better loan growth next year than this year harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so we dont expect to see any kind of big uptick in construction or commercial real estate investment property likely until call it the last half of the year as you say brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc for next year okay got you okay and then just the deposit growth was very strong this quarter just was any part of that and you guys have been focused on the deposit verticals was some of that driven by those verticals or was there anything outsized in terms of contributing to that growth this quarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i think its largely in those verticals and the business model that we put forth with those verticals where weve got experts in those industries that are across the footprint helping relationship managers garner those deposits brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay okay and last two for me just housekeeping harold just the tax rate how to think about that and i think you said on the fee income side the only two really nonrecurring nonsustainable numbers to think about are that you know the securities the equity investments and the gains this quarter about the million in gains this quarter everything else is pretty repeatable harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we feel pretty good weve kind of dug into that fee base pretty hard to try to figure out what the run rate might look like and those are the two items that kind of came to the top brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then the tax rate how to think about the tax rate going forward pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we ought to be at kind of etr kind of brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc going forward perfect okay thanks for the questions and great quarter guys harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brain operator thank you your next question is coming from tim mitchell from raymond james your line is live tim mitchell q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone this is tim in for michael just one question on deposits you kind of just talked about the indexed portion of the portfolio but on the cd portion i was hoping you could shed some color on the maturity schedule kind of the rolloff rate the renewal rate as we move into next year harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah generally about of our cd book is one year or less and about of our cd book is three months or less so thats how it kind of flows year in and year out sometimes brokered deposits we will extend it out with brokered money just to kind of get some fixed rate liabilities on the books but just kind of the indiscernible that time deposit book will be half of it will be three months and about another call it to will be maturing over the next nine months after that tim mitchell q analyst raymond james associates inc understood thank you and then just one more on the target rate for indiscernible so youve taken that down a bit from the previous range indiscernible expectation for lower rates but also maybe some competition just hoping you could kind of shed some light on what those conversations with borrowers are like and how you would expect that to trend as rates presumably continue moving lower harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah youre absolutely right on that we did lower the target rates into something that we think is more competitive were also seeing a lot more inbound traffic for call it private wealth mortgages and the like and we think with these target ranges our relationship managers will be more inclined to negotiate with borrowers and try to secure some of that business for us in the past our target ranges were probably on the high end of the market and we felt like we were missing out on some loan growth because our relationship managers were hesitant to try to negotiate with borrowers when we were indiscernible others pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 tim mitchell q analyst raymond james associates inc great appreciate the color thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc
