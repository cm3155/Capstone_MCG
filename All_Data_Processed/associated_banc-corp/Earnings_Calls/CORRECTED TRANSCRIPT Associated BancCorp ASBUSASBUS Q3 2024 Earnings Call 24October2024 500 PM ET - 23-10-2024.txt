banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well good afternoon everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined once again by our cfo derek meyer and our chief credit officer pat ahern ill start off by sharing some highlights from the quarter and then from there derek will provide a few updates on our margin income statement and capital trends and pat will provide an update on credit at a macro level the third quarter did bring a variety of data points indicating a slowing of the us economy but closer to home we continue to see signs of resiliency and stability in our midwestern footprint unemployment in wisconsin is at and many other midwestern states are also below the national average our prime and super prime consumer base has remained strong and our commercial clients have largely been able to manage their way through elevated rates supply chain issues and inflation we serve stable markets and in tandem with our conservative approach to credit that stability has translated to strong asset quality trends again this quarter importantly it has also enabled us to stay squarely focused on the execution of our strategic plan and now were seeing several tailwinds start to emerge across our company on the consumer side we now have a value proposition that stacks up well against just about anyone in the industry whether thats a commercial bank or a fintech over the past few years weve completely transformed the customer experience by building out a modernized digital banking platform to make it easier for our customers to manage their money when and where they want weve deployed customer favorite product enhancements like grace zone early pay credit monitoring and weve launched a new mass affluent program to deepen relationships with the strategically important customer segment were going to continue to make enhancements but we already have what we need to grow in our markets on the consumer side of the business and we are growing we believe were right on track and importantly so do our customers in weve seen the highest net promoter and mobile banking satisfaction scores on record were also growing our customer base for the first time in years and attracting a higher per household deposit balances with these new customers on the commercial side we continue to build momentum by adding strong producers in key growth markets following the addition of several experienced leaders such as phil trier neil riegelman and michael lebens over the past year were progressing on our overall plan to add commercial and business rms by early earlier this week we announced the launch of a new specialty deposit and payment solutions vertical focused on deposit centric industries such as title and escrow hoa property management and fintechs this vertical will be led by rick bruhn an industry expert who joins us from us bank where he spent the past years of his career our organic phase initiatives are already impacting our financial results here in the third quarter we saw encouraging signs of progress with over million in core customer growth core customer deposit growth and nearly million in ci loan growth and solid core earnings growth we have positioned ourselves to outperform in both an improving macroeconomic scenario or in a low growth market condition with that said id like to walk through some of the additional financial highlights from the third quarter beginning on slide on a gaap basis we posted diluted eps of per share core customer deposits grew by over from the prior quarter but they also grew by relative to the same period last year demonstrating the incremental impact of our initiatives above and beyond the seasonal inflows we typically see this time of year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 this core deposit growth has also enabled us to work down our wholesale funding balances by during the quarter on the other side of the balance sheet weve continued to make progress on our efforts to enhance our profitability profile by diversifying our loan portfolio total loans grew by over led by emerging ci growth and steady production in our auto book shifting to the income statement our balance sheet growth combined with an expansion of asset yields and a slight decrease in liability costs drove a basis point increase in our net interest margin and a million increase in nii during the quarter our revenues were also boosted by a million increase in noninterest income led by continued growth in wealth management fees total noninterest expense increased to million for the quarter but our efficiency ratio decreased slightly as we continue to diligently manage our expense level while executing on our growth strategy throughout the year on the capital front the stability and expansion of our core profitability profile has enabled us to accrete capital throughout the year here in  our cet1 finished at a basis point increase from the end of underpinning our entire strategy is our foundational discipline on managing credit risk and we again saw solid results in  during the quarter our nonaccruals and net charge offs decreased meaningfully we added another million in provision and increased our acll by a basis point as always we remain committed to staying ahead of the curve by taking a disciplined consistent approach to loan risk ratings so we can better understand credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography we will continue to monitor asset quality closely shifting to slide weve talked at length about the foundational outcomes from phase of our strategic plan and here in weve worked hard to build on the momentum by steadily executing our phase initiatives as we sit here in october much of the consumer product work has already been completed specifically weve continued to roll out quarterly product and service updates that enhance the consumer customer experience and position us to attract deepen and retain customer relationships you can see that in the front line where weve addressed pain points that improve the branch and client experience and you can see it in the product set weve added tools to make it easier for customers to manage their money regardless of where they are we still plan to make regular enhancements going forward but the fact is we now have a value proposition that enables us to compete with just about anyone in the marketplace whether thatd be the community banks down the street the large banks in the urban centers or even fintechs we also remain on track for growth on the commercial side of the company where weve continued to make progress in our plans to hire commercial and business rms to support and amplify our growth strategy today weve added a net of rms since september 30th of last year and we expect to hit our target of by early next year the impact of our hires thus far is beginning to emerge in our financial results and we expect this impact to grow throughout as the new our rms across our footprint settle in and build their respective pipelines taken together we remain on track with phase and we continue to expect cumulative incremental commercial loan growth of million cumulative incremental deposit balances of billion and annual household growth of by the end of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 we added slide to give a more visual snapshot of where weve been where we are and where were going as a company these are the three metrics that drive our story first our customers are more satisfied after being named number one for customer satisfaction by jd power back in april were now seeing the highest net promoter and mobile banking satisfaction scores weve ever seen on record at associated bank secondly weve taken a yearslong negative household trend and flipped it to positive in this sets us up to deepen relationships and drive deposit growth over time and finally were continuing to add top talent to our commercial team as weve said in the past this sets us up to drive loan growth but it also positions us to deepen full banking relationships with deposits and other services like tm we feel good about our trajectory and look forward to sharing more specifics around our outlook in january with that id like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the third quarter beginning on slide with the loan portfolio total period end loans grew by million during the quarter and this growth was once again led by our ci and auto verticals we look to continue remixing our balance sheet while retaining our conservative approach to credit as a partial offset to this growth we saw cre construction loans decreased by million during the quarter as an elevated payoff trend extended into  we also saw our resi mortgage book decreased slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to diversify the consumer side of our loan portfolio across our broader portfolio weve continued to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns with this in mind we continue to expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our original range of to in moving to slide we mentioned back in july we expect the deposit growth to ramp up in the second half of and here in  that trend has played out just as expected during the quarter we added over million of core customer deposits a increase relative to  while the primary driver of this growth was customer cds we kept it short funneling the vast majority of that production through our seven months cd and importantly most of our cd holders are already customers of active cd holders had a checking account with us in september this percentage has risen significantly from prior years thanks to our relationship deepening initiatives such as mass affluent those relationship deepening efforts are also visible through growth in other deposit categories such as dda and interest bearing checking during the quarter the inflow of core customer deposits during the quarter enabled us to work down our wholesale funding by with the primary driver being a decreased decrease in fhlb advance we continue to expect core customer deposit growth to finish at the lower end of our original to growth range and we remain confident in our ability to attract and deepen quality customer deposit relationships over time with that ill pass it to derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy ill start by discussing our asset liability yield trends on slide despite the basis point rate cut at the tail end of the quarter we saw asset yields inch higher in all major loan categories including cre ci auto and resi here in  largely driven by these trends our overall earning asset yield increased by basis points during the quarter to on the liability side interest bearing deposit costs ticked up by basis points but growth in deposits enabled us to decrease the reliance on higher cost wholesale funding during the quarter as such our total cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 moving to slide the trends i just described netted out to a basis point expansion in our quarterly net interest margin landing us at for the quarter our nii came in at million for the quarter representing a million increase from prior quarter and an million increase from the same period a year ago based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we now expect to drive net interest income growth of between and in on slide we provided some additional color on the proactive steps weve taken to dampen our asset sensitivity and prepare for a falling rate environment this process started in late when we began adding fixed rate prime and super prime auto loans to our books as of september the portfolio has grown to billion while weve been clear all along that we dont intend to become known as the auto bank these balances come at an attractive yield with less prepayment risk or extension risk than mortgages in addition we began layering in a portfolio of receive fixed swaps to our books in to protect against downside rate risk as of the september we maintained a notional balances of approximately billion and finally weve been thoughtful about our funding mix emphasizing shorter term durations for contractual funding sources such as cds and wholesale funding as of  we had over billion in obligations set to mature in one year or less which is about of the total taken together these actions have put our balance sheet in a much more neutral position with a down ramp scenario representing about a impact to our nii as of  which is reduced from the impact we were modeling in  of our goal is to maintain this modestly asset sensitive position going forward shifting to slide we continue to manage our securities book within our to target range with the benefit of rising rates combined with the securities repositioning we completed late last year the average yield on our securities book is basis points higher than the same period a year ago on a dollar basis both our cash and investment securities positions increased slightly as compared to  and these combined positions now represent of total assets over the remainder of we continue to target investments to total assets of between to on slide we provide an update on noninterest income through  total noninterest income came in at million during the quarter which represents a increase from  on a yeartodate basis noninterest income continues to track roughly million higher than in here in the third quarter growth trends were primarily driven by wealth management fees which were up million compared to  and service charges which were up million over the same period this growth was partially offset by smaller decreases in indiscernible mortgage banking and capital markets we continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged environment and as such we continue to expect full year noninterest income to finish in the range of negative to growth as compared to our adjusted base of million moving to slide we continue to make ongoing investments to support our growth initiatives but maintaining our thoughtful disciplined approach to where we invest those dollars continues to be a foundational focus in the third quarter total noninterest expense of million was up million compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by increases in legal professional and fdic assessment costs despite the dollar uptick in expenses our adjusted efficiency ratio actually decreased during the quarter to and our noninterest expense to average assets ratio has remained in line with prior quarters at these metrics are a reflection of our commitment to keeping expenses in check while investing in our organic growth strategy with this in mind we lowered our full year expense outlook we now expect total noninterest expense growth of between and in off of our adjusted base of million as a reminder this outlook excludes associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 the million fdic special assessment expense booked in and an additional million of net fdic special assessment expense booked in the first three quarters of on slide we once again saw key capital ratios increased across the board here in  we saw a basis point net increase in our tce ratio during the quarter finishing at this net increase was driven by aoci recovery and improved profitability partially offset by asset growth in the ph denominator aoci recovery represented about basis points of benefit after falling to as a result of our balance sheet repositioning in  of last year our cet1 ratio has steadily climbed throughout and currently sits at as of  this is now the highest cet1 ratio weve posted since  of tce and cet1 both remain well within our target ranges as of  given current market conditions we continue to expect tce to remain in the range of to in we also expect cet1 to remain in a range of to over the same timeframe ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start our credit portion with an allowance update on slide we utilized the moodys august baseline forecast for cecl forward looking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent for the resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment the baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive gdp growth rates a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation our acll increased by another million in  to finish the quarter at million with an increase in cre partially offset by a decrease in commercial and business lending the uptick in cre largely stemmed from some migration into criticized loans during  we do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant shift in credit stress but rather it is a reflection of our adherence to risk rating definition guidance acknowledging shifts in credit profiles the bank does not view these credits representing risk of loss at this time as reflected in our stable acll altogether our reserves to loan ratio increased by basis point from the prior quarter and basis points from the same period a year ago to moving to slide we maintain a high degree of confidence in the quality of our loan portfolio with continued solid performance in core credit quality trends credit metric changes are reflective of the continued theme of normalization within the portfolio at the front of the pipeline total bank wide delinquencies landed at million during the third quarter after a downtick last quarter  is in line with recent trends and historical averages further down the line total criticized and classified loans increased from the prior quarter as noted earlier the majority of this increase was driven by a migration within cre loans again we do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant shift in the credit profile of the portfolio but rather it is a reflection of our adherence to risk rating definition guidance which acknowledges shifts in specific credits but does not represent risk of loss at this time we continue our ongoing portfolio deep dives and dont see a systemic shift in the cre portfolio in fact we see nearterm resolution in many of the noted downgrades within the nonaccrual bucket specifically we saw balances decrease for the second consecutive quarter to million we continue to see a steady pace of resolution within these stressed credits finally we booked million in net charge offs during the quarter and million in provision both of which represented the lowest numbers weve seen in the past several quarters associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 our net charge off ratio decreased by basis points to taken together our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that what weve seen todate is a handful of credits migrating through the rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters overall outside of these specific situations we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity weve seen across the bank going forward we remain diligent and monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures and labor cost to name just a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effect of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank wide we expect any future provision adjustments will continue to reflect changes to risk rates economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality finally weve provided a refresh of key cre metrics in slide in building our cre portfolio we focused on partnering with wellknown developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable midwest markets two thirds of our cre portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties we do not have any exposure to rent controlled new york city real estate market office loans now represent just of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio we are weighted towards class a properties in nonurban environments we continue to take a proactive approach to cre office credits with the majority of those maturing for the remainder of and into already having strategies in place whether thatd be refinance sale or qualifying for extensions and prevailing underwriting standards while we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in we will continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely with that i will now pass it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat ill wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide starting with the balance sheet weve continued to seek selective loan growth that emphasizes full banking relationships quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns with this in mind we continue to expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our original range of to in were pleased with the work thats been done across the bank to attract deepen and retain customer relationships and with the resulting momentum weve seen in foundational areas such as customer satisfaction and household growth remain confident in our ability to deliver core customer deposit growth and we continue to expect our core customer deposit growth to finish at the lower end of our original to growth range on the income statement weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and rate environment taking these factors into account we now expect net interest income growth of between and for we continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged environment and continue to expect noninterest income growth of negative to positive in relative to our adjusted base and finally our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our company with this in mind weve lowered our noninterest expense outlook to growth of to in after excluding the impact of fdic special assessment with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is from daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hi thank you good afternoon everybody maybe first just on the margin as we think about how we might go forward just you have a table on slide that that shows the funding maturities just curious kind of some of the rate pickup opportunities you think on a especially on the one year funding opportunities that you show there what that might look like andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so ill say a couple of things i am getting a little feedback page we put out there on purpose i mean we wanted to show our contractual funding obligations really have been contained to one year or less and i think that jumps out pretty clearly when you think about the one year out we feel like we have a lot of ability to work with the rate increase that is slow and steady i would say where anybody would get in trouble is or be pressured more on margin would be if you see a big jump quickly and then you see an inverted rate curve were not believing that those two things will happen and so with the fact that weve been ph able to remain short and then on the cd side it doesnt even pull up the fact that we have billion in customer cds that are essentially seven months in duration when those are renewing were getting plus retention on those and were picking up basis points plus so far so we feel like we can manage the downward interest rate risk there are a lot of factors that come into that during the year we havent given guidance for next year but weve set ourselves up in a way to be ready for that and i would say the other thing that dereks done a very nice job for us is making us less asset sensitive which is also on page you can see back when i had gotten here we were very asset sensitive and we kind of wrote that up and then steadily over a couple of years derek and his team managed that down purposefully where now we think were very much in line with the industry and with an even playing field it comes down to execution of strategies daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc and then maybe one on the lender hirings where you you provided an update as to where you stand now it looks like theres it looks like a pretty good jump here in the next quarter or two with the kind of final leg of those hirings but curious where you stand in terms of where you think you stand in terms of kind of fully baked in opportunities from those lenders for from a lending perspective and where that that might end up andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so we gave we put at the beginning what our forecast for increased performance would be maybe i could share some stats that we havent explicitly called out but when we look up were about up in rms over the past year whats interesting is we track pipelines greater than probability to close and pipelines above now above some people might say thats wishful thinking below that if you have above associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 certainty youre pretty likely going to close those deals that pipeline from a year ago is up so we already see the early its great to hire people we dont make money by hiring people we make money by having them get out there get a full relationship and book it so right now the category that has the probability of closing above is growing at a rate very similar to what were seeing in the hiring front so thats pretty impactful to us we also hired people have not solicitations those expired we had one expire in october we have one expire in november our ability to attract top talent and ph im just confident right now as i have been since i joined this company years ago so i feel quite confident were going to be able to bring in talent over the next three to four months and get the entire team net the net team at a position where we are up rms it takes about six months for somebody typically to really hit their stride so we and i expect the impact from the folks weve already hired throughout the year were sticking with what we believe we can get an upside because these folks are talented and theyre bringing their pipelines up at a rate that is as quite good so its a long answer to a short question but now weve gone to the second phase which is weve gone from hiring people to seeing a pipeline that has certainty in this past quarter we saw a little bit of growth we expect that that will continue on even a modest growth marketplace through daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific appreciate all that color ill step back thanks andy andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you thanks daniel operator thank you our next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everybody thanks for taking the question andy i was hoping you might be able to kind of discuss the outlook for the complexion of loan growth in the fourth quarter i think you ph really touched on it or a portion of it with the comments about onboarding personnel from earlier this year but it looks like i mean need to be just a touch stronger than you generated in the third quarter so just curious where that will come from and maybe more broadly if you can spend a moment on sort of what your customers are saying about appetite to borrow what might get them off the sidelines et cetera andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah well you asked a lot in that one question indiscernible and so what i would say is every quarter that goes by if you think about a ramp up of six months we got another quarter for the folks that are here in the commercial team so that piece of it gives me quite a bit of confidence weve been able to bring auto loans in at a really nice yield and when were bringing people in last month i believe derek the fico was ph associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i mean derek and i are concerned that we wont be able to get financed so were really pleased with the quality of that customer but were also steadily growing that portfolio going into the rest of the year we wont accelerate that but those have been the key drivers for us on the commercial real estate side its healthy to get payoffs when people have completed some of their construction projects so were down in that category i actually see that as a good thing for the bank and for the borrower however that longer term rate stayed a little bit high so we may not we may not see the payoffs in the fourth quarter that we did in the third quarter thats uncertain but it looks like if those stay a little high and we get the yield curve we are seeing now that that could also lead to a fewer payoffs and then finally when you have a situation where you bring in a lot of new people you do have some people exit and so we look closely at the portfolio and say with the exits what credits are we willing to exit and so we had a few credits that we thought were okay if they exited in the second and third quarter we feel pretty clean right now and so we dont think that we would have the payoff volume that we had in the prior two quarters either so you marry a seasoned commercial group with a steady auto book and a decrease in payoffs and thats where we think well weve stayed pretty steady in the range that we have but now weve gone to the lower end of it on loans r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got you okay perfect thank you and then maybe pat can you would you mind spending just a second kind of expanding on your comments regarding the increase in criticized loans it feels kind of like because there was just a risk rating shift in there would that be sort of a onetime step up or does that take a couple of quarters to work its way through how do the sort of pushes and pulls in their work patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp well as i noted i think weve circled a handful of those credits that we think are kind of shortterm they could see upgrades in the next quarter or two so were not overly concerned that theres going to be some continued migration there these are kind of a lot of the things these are not portfolio wide these are more select credits and its kind of normal course of business stuff that were seeing and ill point out that in the cre book we continue to focus on longterm customer relationships and these are sponsors weve worked with for many years we remain very confident in how those relationships are stepping up and working with us to address some of these issues and like i said theyre more kind of normal course of business stuff and nothing systematic or a big shift within the portfolio r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got you all right sounds good thank you very much associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you scott operator thank you our next question is from jared shaw with barclays please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good evening thanks maybe just going back to the auto side the auto growth has been a little lower than i think what you had indicated earlier in the year but you call out good yields and great credit metrics there whats causing you to keep that growth rate a little lower than maybe you would that ph to range earlier is it just trying to build that capital ratio or whats sort of the dynamic from keeping you from seeing better growth there andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah its not thanks for the question jared its not the capital ratio this is a category ph where weve said we want to be prime and super prime and we want it to fit into the rest of our book and we dont want to be aggressive weve said we dont want to be the auto bank per se and we want to make sure that were keeping our outstandings in a range for us as weve seen a little bit slower growth we dont want it to outpace the rest of the portfolio however the deals that were putting on with the ph fico and a very nice yield is very good business we dont want to dip down in fico we dont want to dip down in credit risk on a balance scorecard we wont and so when demand has gone down a little bit we could expand our network of dealers we havent aggressively done that to make up for it we like the pace that were running at we like the dealers that were dealing with we like the steady growth in the business and frankly we want our commercial business to ramp up and that is thats the area of focus for us right now where weve where were trying to get a pivot in the overall portfolio so as weve seen some softening in the auto sales overall we havent felt that we need to press on that to put something put additional volume on the books jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks for that color and then on the securities portfolio i mean derek whats the expectation on cash flow over the next year coming from securities and can you just sort of remind us of what the roll off yield and roll on yield is looking like derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so we have about million a quarter that rolls off were probably putting on million the differential in whats rolling off and whats ph going back on is not as large as it was but its still probably basis points to basis points we have a good portion of that still in our held to maturity thats more muni and those ph not rolling off theyre more longterm investments so we but we still think for the next five or six quarters youre going to get basis points or basis points a quarter pickup in the total book associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks and then just finally for me i guess yeah looking at expenses and maybe looking out into to not guidance for but just sort of the outlook with you pulling back the expense growth going into the end of the year but still bringing on these new hires how should we think about the trajectory maybe of longer term investment in the business and this positive operating leverage something we should be thinking is attainable as you as we go out over the next year or so andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp let me take that one so you said a few things in there and i will say we dont share guidance for until january but a few things with regards to positive operating leverage because you started with expenses but of course its expense and revenue and the revenue part of it is really impacted by rate and so when we think about the first piece of that we think we set ourselves up by staying short on deposits what we do know going into next year and im particularly happy with is that we have momentum in categories that we need momentum in in order to drive revenue and that is customer growth that is deposit growth thats sustainable and when you have customer growth with really high satisfaction that lead to sustainable deposit growth so i feel really good about that heading into next year we have a commercial book on the deposit side that we right sized a couple of businesses were done right sizing that so as we head into my expectation is to market outperform versus our peers going into that and then look we have spent a lot of energy getting really good leaders on the commercial side and good people attract good people and we mix that with a team that was really pretty solid that we already had at the bank with the new folks were adding that are quality i dont see anyone that has that combination of customer satisfaction customer growth leading to deposit growth on consumer and then investment in additional rms on a base of and so i find those to be good lead indicators that were set up to outperform now to get to positive operating leverage we have to understand what happens in the rate cut scenario and theres no one on this call that knows that we know that the rates are likely to be cut we dont know at what pace at what time and we dont know what the yield curve will do on that and id say that those the impact of those theyre not just generic loan and deposit impacts they could impact stuff like the amortization of resi loans that are at lower rate which we would love to see so were going to get a feel for that we think as we go through this final quarter and well be set up in a better position to answer that positive operating leverage question but jared you know thats on my mind obviously i could rattle off a lot of things that go into that but thats what our team is discussing what we think the impact of rate thats probably the biggest unknown because were tracking every other key indicator going into it so we think were relatively well set up from a revenue and expense standpoint and i will tell you weve already as we have in every single year weve actually just wrapped up our expense management tactics going into so were ready on that piece down to the line of business at this point jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks thanks for the color associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp jon indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey one followup on jareds question derek on the securities portfolio size should we expect modest growth like weve seen in the last few quarters is that the right way to think about it derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thats right yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc noninterest bearing deposits we talked about that a little bit last quarter i expect them to be a little bit higher but maybe just help us understand whats going on there and what kind of an outlook you have is that maybe troughed derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think well we saw a little bit of growth this quarter its ph it works were closing in on probably the level that we thought wed finish the year maybe its million to million less than we thought four quarters ago but its it grew this quarter and we think its stabilized on the nominal dollar amount we think the rest of the book is going to continue to grow faster going into next year so as i think ive said before i think as a percent the industry is going to see a smaller percent of noninterest bearing but i dont see it as a risk to earnings like it was at the end of the year and last year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and i would say comparatively if you think about a bank thats growing at on their customer base checking household customer base for one thats growing at to which is what we expect and by the way we havent been able to enjoy that kind of growth in the past we went from minus to to we expect associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 this year and were forecasting ph next year so that plays a positive role when you think about noninterest bearing accounts and balances jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay and then just on the net interest income guide the to when you kind of play around with the numbers it feels like net interest income is troughing i know the margin is a little bit tougher but is it safe to say that net interest income is likely at a bottom at this point based on what youre seeing derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think we think as we look at this year and start to think about scenarios for next year that second quarter was our trough jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right one more if i can pat i understand you answered the question earlier on criticized but any thoughts on the provision from here is this just something thats going to match loan growth and charge offs or is there something telling you you guys need to continue to slowly build reserves patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp i think were pretty solid with where our reserves are right now and i think well continue to watch any movements but i think loan growth is obviously a factor so well look at that but we feel pretty good about the reserves right now jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks guys appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you jon operator thank you our next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens inc please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions maybe if we could start how is your deposit pricing strategy on noncd products how has that changed following last months fed announcement and more rates to come and i ask because i do think of associated is to be more of an offensive bank playing offense and then how do you see the ph downrate deposit beta tracking going forward andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp indiscernible associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so the so i think whats been pleasing and it might be because of softer loan growth during the quarter we as an industry weve seen at least initially everybody drop rates pretty aggressively so that allowed us to do that we took our rate specials down to from to and i think were already moving those down in the next week again and that seems to be similar to what i see other banks doing so thats been a positive normally you see deposits lag quite a bit in the first quarter after rates start dropping again i see the industry moving pretty quick which gives us room from that standpoint if we think about going into next year we think that the indiscernible are the same that weve shared before which would be to on interest bearing probably on total deposits i think thats looking at this before this first rate cut all the way through next december terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect and then a follow up for patty how much should we read into the increase in the construction cre reserve is up to and was that connected at all to the migration into substandard loans that weve talked about a couple of times patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah in part it was due to that migration and then as always were always looking at the cre office book to make sure were thats still playing out in many markets so we want to make sure weve got enough cushion there just for the future but its a combination of both terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great and then maybe one quick on that the million of wealth management fees is that a good run rate the markets been strong or are there any onetime estate fees or something like that that can show up in any given quarter andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah now look im really pleased with our wealth business were just starting to hit the tip of the iceberg with that the markets been good thats been a driver of it however were seeing referrals into that at a rate that weve not seen before and so when you start to grow your customer base when you create a mass affluent strategy that logically upstreams into private wealth thats starting to happen in addition to that when you add commercial rms in that and then you get to those all have business owners and the partnership there has been spectacular and so theyre starting to referring to there weve had good financial performance there frankly in the future weve had investments in our consumer bank with step one weve had investments in our commercial bank that was step two were going to meet at wealth here at some point in the future and but in the meantime were seeing a really nice trend going into that business terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect thanks for taking my questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you terry operator thank you our next question is from timur braziler with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon starting with some of the changes on the funding side with the incremental time deposits coming on and the mix shift within the wholesale base can you give us some sort of proxy as to where funding costs were at september to help us kind of formulate the starting points of derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp im not sure you mean a spot funding cost estimate timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp what is timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no i dont have that calculated i would refer you to indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so theres just a lot of movement and theres just a lot of movement on the liability side i thought well maybe we can get a little bit more detail as to what that did to the pricing dynamic maybe even just within the deposit base i guess where were the cds ph brought on was that at a rate below the rate or how does the number of indiscernible on in indiscernible derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 yeah i mean you saw that we changed pricing all throughout the quarter so you had us or most of our cd rates were at our specials were at we took them up above that for a few weeks at the end and then we took them right down to another at and were taking them to on november so its been very dynamic from that standpoint and then you had about half the cd book in the brokered market and all those we had four handles on it in terms of production so when you see our quarteroverquarter cd book it was flat we grew it but the rate was exactly the same the two quarters put together timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp that and that was timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp youll see that on page of the tables we set out and that was at for both quarters on an ph aev basis timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for that and then i guess just looking at the nii guide that imply a step up in the fourth quarter and i get that asset sensitivity has been reduced kind of when you extend out over the next months but im just wondering where the confidence is and nii being able to grow in given maybe some of the nearterm asset sensitivity pressures and the lag that might come on the liability side derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think our biggest confidence in nii growth and the fact that we think this second quarter this year was the trough is driven by the our strategies and that what i mean by that is the loan growth and the deposit growth both in improved profitability products so ci loans versus resi run off core customer deposits versus the wholesale funding and then the overall growth of the balance sheet is what gives us that confidence i think if we werent taking market share and didnt have a plan to take market share visàvis our ci strategy it would be harder for us to say that because you just wouldnt have enough balance sheet growth to support the nii outlook were talking about timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then maybe another way of asking my first question just any thoughts around interest bearing beta as it sits in and then what the expectation is for beta on the way down and kind of magnitude and timeline associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no we dont i dont have a quarterly beta for you i think the best guidance would be what already answered the question before looking out between before the first rate cut which would have been august and where we expect our beta to finish in december of next year i can add that that would have assumed basis points of cuts yet this year basis points cuts of next year and you get to a full deposit beta of timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks timur operator thank you our next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks for the question derek the loan betas i guess can you just help us on loan betas your assumptions on the down beta for the assets there derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so i guess i think the easiest thing because thats going to depend a lot on mix is to is we do disclose its in the q and i think i dont think its changed much since the last one youll see it in the new one our loan book either reprices or mature of that either reprices or matures within a year if you take our we have a billion of swaps about billion of that is against the loans that would take that that reprices in a year down to about so that offers you some opportunity christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and then if you think of the securities book on of that in terms of earning assets you expect those yields and i think like i mentioned early in the call to trickle up throughout the year so that can take your overall asset beta below the deposit beta or total liability beta i talked about you are right the challenge is going to be is that just how things end next year and we think that that gives us the opportunity to expand margin higher at the end of next year than this year but the path there will largely depend on the aggressiveness in the industry for deposit pricing and thats why i think a little bit slower growth is probably better for us from a deposit standpoint because we dont think people be as competitive on deposits we still have the advantage of generating our own loan growth because we have the market share strategy by hiring the more ci relationship managers associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats really helpful thank you the i guess maybe a housekeeping  seasonality on deposits anything to be aware of and then also on the securities book can you just remind us whats ph fixed floating in that portfolio thank you derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp almost all of its fixed theres a little bit in terms of the securities theres a little bit of fhlbs in there sometimes but thats so i treat that as largely all fixed and then seasonality for us on deposits tends to be strong if you look at the back half of last year we were strong also i expect that to repeat itself particularly with the additional initiatives in place christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you chris operator thank you there are no further questions at this time andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well we really appreciate everyones interest and the questions we look forward to talking to you soon if you have a question between now and next quarter feel free
