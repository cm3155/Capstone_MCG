andy harmening and im joined once again by our chief financial officer derek meyer and our chief credit officer pat ahern id like to start off by sharing some highlights from the quarter and then from there derek will provide a few updates on our margin income statement and capital trends and paul will provide an update on credit midway through we have remained squarely focused on supporting our markets while continuing to execute on our plans to grow our customer base deepen our relationship and enhance our profitability in the context of the broader us economy we remain pleased with the stability and resilience of our upper midwest footprint several states including wisconsin and minnesota remain below unemployment our primesuper prime consumer base has largely taken inflation in stride and our commercial clients have remained upbeat while navigating a challenging rate environment with these trends as a backdrop our credit performance remained solid here in the second quarter delinquencies criticized loans and net chargeoffs all decreased versus the prior quarter and weve steadily added to our provision over the past several quarters todate we have yet to see any meaningful negative trends that are concerning with regards to specific asset classes or geographies this stability is a reflection of our home markets but its also a reflection of our disciplined proactive approach weve taken as a company weve anchored ourselves in familiar midwest markets and weve developed a diversified cre portfolio with limited exposure to ph downtown office properties and other key pressure points and while were pleased with the results weve seen to date our experienced team remains vigilant methodical in reviewing our portfolios on a continual basis to ensure were staying ahead of any issues that may emerge down the road thanks to our strong credit foundation weve stayed on offense steadily executing on our strategic plan this pattern of execution was established shortly after i joined when we launched phase of our plan back in september of over three years weve built a foundation for growth weve enhanced our lending capabilities through the addition of new loan verticals and expansion of our commercial team weve strengthened our ability to attract deepen and retain customer relationships through product service and marketing enhancements and weve invested significantly into digital to better compete in an evolving financial services landscape the tailwinds of phase enhancements continue to benefit our company in exciting ways were seeing meaningful improvement in our customer satisfaction scores where after being named number one in retail customer satisfaction by jd power in april were now seeing the highest net promoter scores weve seen as a company since we started tracking internally in customers today are more likely to recommend associated bank to friends and family than they have been in years weve seen household growth where after several year period of negative trends weve seen a net positive growth in consumer checking households in both  and  of this year in fact net households grew at a faster rate in the second quarter than they have in any other quarter in over a decade and were not just opening more accounts they are higher quality accounts as well yeartodate weve seen a increase in deposit balances per new checking customer as compared to last year and while these trends are fun to talk about they are also foundational for revenue growth and our ability to transform our profitability profile over time and they give us confidence that were on the right path associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 phase of our plan is designed to build on this momentum by accelerating our organic growth strategy and midway through the year we remain on track since april weve made several additional key leadership hires further expanded our promising mass affluent program and launched new marketing tactics just this week we launched another upgrade of our digital platform with a new credit monitoring tool enabling digital customers to easily track their credit score and safeguard their financial future as i mentioned back in april we expect our phase initiatives to have an increasing impact as we get to the back half of and into looking forward the progress weve made todate against our strategic plan is foundational for our company weve combined legacy strengths in credit and expense management with initiatives that help us grow and deepen our customer base enhance profitability and accrete capital while the macroeconomic path is somewhat uncertain in the near term we feel wellpositioned to work through that uncertainty and to accelerate with a growing economy thanks to tailwinds from initiatives already completed and incremental momentum from phase simply put we remain on track towards creating a stronger return profile for associated bank and our stakeholders with that id like to walk through some financial highlights from the second quarter beginning on slide on a gaap basis our earnings per share came in at for the quarter this figure includes a onetime million tax benefit resulting from a strategic reallocation of our investment portfolio excluding this onetime impact our adjusted eps was or flat versus  this figure demonstrates the underlying ability of our earning profile in what has continued to be a challenging operating environment for banks during the quarter we continued to remix the asset side of the balance sheet with average loan growth of million once again this growth was led by commercial and our primesuper prime auto book but the pace of loan growth slowed in several categories due to payoffs and slightly lower loan demand in an elevated rate environment average core customer deposits decreased by less than in what is typically a slower growth deposit growth quarter for the bank this broad trend was largely in line with our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to grow our core customer deposits in the back half of the year shifting to the income statement asset yields and a shift in our funding mix together drove a million decrease in net interest income noninterest income trends have remained stable overall with continued momentum from our wealth business leading the way on feebased revenue on the expense front we continue to invest in our initiatives but discipline remains a foundational focus for our company total interest expense came in at million for the quarter and we will continue to diligently manage our expense level as we execute against our growth strategy throughout the year shifting to capital the stability of our core profitability combined with the onetime tax benefit recognized during the quarter added meaningfully to our accretion of our capital ratios here in  our cet1 finished at or basis point increase relative to  and finally our conservative approach to credit continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy here in  asset quality remained solid with delinquencies criticized loans and net chargeoffs all down compared to prior quarter we remain committed to staying ahead of the curve by taking a disciplined consistent approach to loan risk ratings so we can better understand credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography as always we will continue to monitor asset quality closely associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 on slide we provided a walk forward of our gaap and adjusted eps to more clearly display the impact of the million tax benefit we incurred during the second quarter as mentioned this onetime item was a result of a strategic reallocation of our investment securities portfolio this represented a impact to our eps for the quarter adjusting for this onetime item eps of was flat compared to the first quarter moving to slide id like to provide a little bit more color on where we are with our strategic plan and how were setting up to create a stronger associated since announcing phase of the plan back in weve added several new loan verticals grown our commercial rm base upgraded our product set invested in digital transformation and amplified our brand presence throughout the footprint these investments have generated several tailwinds that are foundational for our company we diversified our asset base by adding nearly million in assetbased lending and equipment finance verticals and billion in primesuper prime auto loans weve expanded our commercial rm base since weve added over billion in net new mass affluent deposits since launching the program in december of weve seen meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction scores where after being named number one in retail banking customer satisfaction by jd power in april we are now seeing a fourandahalf year high in our digital satisfaction scores and the highest net promoter scores weve seen since started tracking this metric in and finally we are now growing primary checking households at associated reversing a steady trend of net decreases over the past decade after posting net growth across the board in consumer business and wealth households in  we posted the highest consumer checking household growth weve seen in over a decade in  were also seeing higher quality accounts being opened with the deposit balances per new household up versus we continue to believe that customer growth and higher quality accounts will deliver enhanced financial tailwinds over time shifting to slide phase of our plan leverages foundational tailwinds up from phase and an infusion of proven leaders in key areas across the bank to accelerate momentum as a company we continue to expand and deepen our talent base over the past two years weve added a number of executives and key leaders across the bank who are uniquely positioned to support and amplify our growth strategy thats particularly true on the commercial side where most recently we added ph mike levins to our commercial team in minnesota mike joined us in may after years with wells fargo where he most recently served as the division portfolio executive for six states including minnesota and wisconsin whether at the executive level or on the front line having the right people in the right places is essential to the success of our strategic plan with that in mind were also progressing on our plan to hire additional commercial rms which represents an incremental increase versus september of while the recent hires weve made todate are already making a valuable contribution in the short time with associated were confident that their impact will grow over time as we continue to add talent to our team weve also made steady quarterly progress with our product marketing and digital initiatives in phase after launching a new social media campaign in  to amplify our brand and highlight our products and services we expanded that campaign through a partnership with multiple social media influencers in  including local wisconsinbased charlie berens weve also continued to expand our mass affluent program providing training for bankers across our footprint associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 since launching phase in november weve trained an additional bankers to manage mass affluent relationships and we now have a total of bankers who are specially trained to handle these unique relationships helping to grow this promising segment for the bank and just this week we introduced a new credit monitor tool for our digital customers taken together with the enhancements weve already made actions like these are expected to bolster our efforts to attract new customers and deepen existing relationships while we remain encouraged by the ongoing momentum weve seen from phase we expect our phase initiatives to have a more meaningful impact on our financial results as we get to the back half of and into this gives us confidence that were on the right track with our strategic plan and as such we continue to expect cumulative incremental commercial loan growth of million and cumulative incremental deposit balances of billion and an annual household growth rate of by the year end on slide this is just a reminder that we are in the process of remixing our balance sheet to drive higher returns through multiple different efforts ill quickly transition to slide id like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the second quarter beginning with loans on slide on a quarterly basis loans grew by million during the second quarter led once again by our ci and auto portfolios weve continued to emphasize these two areas as a way to help remix our balance sheet over time and decrease our reliance on low yielding low relationship asset classes and to enhance our return profile while still maintaining solid credit standards with that said we did see the rate of growth slow in the second quarter particularly in auto book where we saw softer demand across our dealer network in  we were also impacted by elevated payoffs in our cre portfolio and saw average cre loans decrease by million during the quarter across our broader portfolio we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns while we continue to expect tailwinds from our initiatives in the back half of the year we now expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our range of to due to market conditions and previously mentioned increase in cre payoffs moving to slide we mentioned back in april that our  deposit trends were somewhat inflated by seasonality and as we expected those balances normalized in  while the second quarters typically a slower seasonal growth quarter for associated bank anyway we also saw an unusually large swing in our pointtopoint balance flows relative to the first quarter this period end decrease was largely a timing issue driven by disbursement of seasonal balances that were expected to flow out before the end of  but didnt flow out until early  this timing issue was a key driver in the period end flows in both total deposits and dda nonetheless the broader trend over the first half of the year has largely remained in line with what weve communicated previously we expected balances to bottom in  and then grow modestly the rest of the year that continues to be our expectation on a quarterly average basis which allows for a more normalized view of these flows core customer deposits decreased by less than slide we include a broader threequarter view of our quarterly average deposit trends more clearly show the stability weve seen in the first half of the year despite the lumpy pointtopoint balances between  and  quarterly average core customer deposits were essentially flat from  of to  of in fact they were slightly up as discussed earlier we continue to feel very wellpositioned for core customer growth in the coming quarters due to expected tailwinds from promising leading indicators such as customer household growth and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 satisfaction metrics these leading indicators are foundational changes for our company that will enable us to sustainably grow our customer base over time while we remain confident in our ability to deliver core customer deposit growth over the back half of the market for deposits has remained competitive in this higher for longer environment due to current market conditions we now expect core customer deposits to finish at the lower end of the to range given previously so with that ill pass it on to derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends derek derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy ill start on slide with some color on our asset and liability and yield trends while the target fed funds rate has remained stable since july of last year weve continued to see asset yields inch higher in most major loan categories including ci auto and mortgage here in  we also saw our investment yields increase basis points during the quarter as we continue to benefit from the securities repositioning we completed last year with that said our overall  earning asset yield was also negatively impacted by basis points relative to  due to a lower level of nonaccrual interest rate recoveries particularly within cre and ci loans taken together with the core growth in our loan and securities yields mentioned previously our earning asset yields increased by basis points and landed at during the second quarter on the liability side of the balance sheet we continue to see lingering funding cost pressures due primarily to elevated wholesale funding costs weve actually seen both our cost of total interestbearing deposits and cost of total deposits decrease slightly in  these trends were more than offset by the addition of higher cost wholesale funding during the quarter all in our cost of total interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to for the quarter on slide the trends i just described netted out to basis point decrease in our quarterly net interest margin with basis points impact coming from the quarterly swing in recoveries on the asset yield side and the other basis points attributed to higher funding costs despite this pressure on nim our net interest income has remained stable the million we posted in  was down just million from  and it was higher than our nii in the third and fourth quarters of last year based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we expect sequential growth in our net interest income over the remainder of the year and nim expansion by year end with that said given market conditions we now expect to drive net interest income growth of between and in this guidance assumes two basis point fed cuts by year end beginning in september shifting to slide weve continued to manage our securities book within our to target range with the benefit of higher rates combined with the securities repositioning we completed last year the average yield on our securities book has now risen by basis points from the same period a year ago on a dollar basis both our cash and investment securities positions increased slightly versus  but as a percent of total assets these positions held firm at in  over the remainder of we will continue to target investments to total assets of between and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 on slide we highlight our noninterest income trends throughout the second quarter our noninterest income came in at million for the quarter which was up slightly compared to  and down slightly from the same period a year ago on a yeartodate basis noninterest income was up million or compared to during the second quarter our results were highlighted by growth in wealth management fees cardbased fees and boli income this was partially offset by a million decrease in net investment securities gains with the decrease driven by the million gain on sale of visa b shares we booked back in  as a reminder we have no visa b shares remaining as of march 31st we continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in the challenging environment and we now full year noninterest income to finish plus or minus as compared to our adjusted base of million moving to slide weve continued to manage our expense base diligently despite ongoing investments to support our growth initiatives this discipline remains a foundational focus across the company our second quarter expenses of million were down million from the prior quarter but embedded in our  number was a million adjustment of the fdic special assessment expense booked in  following an updated estimate received from the fdic here in  our adjusted efficiency ratio increased from the multiquarter low we now posted in  but our noninterest expense to average assets ratio continued to decrease in the second quarter landing at this metric underscores our ability to keep expenses in check while continuing to invest in our organic growth strategy we continue to expect total noninterest expense growth of between and in off of our adjusted base of million these figures exclude the fdic special assessment impacts in   and  shifting to slide our stable core profitability trends combined with the onetime tax benefit booked during the quarter drove meaningful capital accretion across the board in  we saw a basis point net increase in our tce ratio during the quarter finishing at this net increase was driven by improved profitability partially offset by asset growth in the denominator after falling to as a result of our balance sheet repositioning in  our cet1 rebounded to in  and finished  at the highest cet1 ratio weve posted in two years both our tce and cet1 remain well within our target ranges as of  given current market conditions we continue to expect tce to remain in the range of to in we also expect cet1 to remain in a range of to over the same timeframe ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start our credit portion with our allowance update on slide weve utilized the moodys ph may baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment the baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive gdp growth rate a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation our acll increased by another million in  to finish the quarter at million with increases in cre construction and other consumer categories partially offset by decreases in commercial and business lending cre investor and resi mortgage our allowance continues to be driven primarily by loan growth in select areas such as auto nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our midwest associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 footprint as such our reservetoloan ratio landed at here in  up basis point versus  and up basis points compared to the same period a year ago moving to slide weve continued to see solid performance in our core credit quality trends with credit metric changes reflective of the continued theme of normalization within the portfolio at the top of the pipeline total bankwide delinquencies have decreased for the second consecutive quarter with million in total delinquencies in  this figure represents a million improvement from the prior quarter and a million improvement from the same period a year ago delinquencies often serve as an early warning sign of stress in the portfolio so weve been pleased to see the improvement in these numbers despite a challenging macro environment in further down the line total criticized and classified loan trends also improved slightly for the third consecutive quarter while we did see an uptick in the substandard accruing bucket this is more than offset by decreases in our special mention and nonaccrual segments we remain encouraged with the stability of total criticized assets and the decrease in those credits showing early stress within the nonaccrual bucket specifically we continue to see puts and takes consistent with our normal course of business in  we did see an uptick in nonaccruals within cre which is largely driven by a cre office credit however early indication is we are leading to a path towards favorable resolution with this credit in  outside of that one particular credit total nonaccruals would have decreased even further for the quarter which we see as another sign of overall credit stability finally we booked million in net chargeoffs during the quarter and million in provision both of which represented a million decrease from  the overall net chargeoff rate still remains within expectations taken together our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that weve seen todate is a handful of credits migrating to our rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters overall outside of these specific situations we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity weve seen across the bank as weve done over the past couple of years our ongoing quarterly portfolio deep dive and risk rating analysis remain a focus and a key tool to stay ahead of credit concerns given the uncertain macro outlook noted earlier as we look to the back half of we remain diligent and monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures and labor costs to name just a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including our ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bankwide going forward we expect ph any provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes to risk grades economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality finally weve provided a refresh of key cre metrics on slide as a reminder our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past several years as weve built a diverse portfolio of high quality commercial loans across our portfolios with a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolios while cre continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry we feel wellpositioned given the conservative approach weve applied across the bank in building our cre portfolio weve focused on partnering with well known developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable midwest markets twothirds of our cre portfolio ph is currently in midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties we do not have any exposure to the rentcontrolled new york city real estate market associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 office loans now represent just of our total loans as a bank within that portfolio we are weighted towards classa properties in nonurban environments we continue to take a proactive approach to cre office credits with the majority of those maturing for the remainder of already having strategies in place whether that be refinance sale or qualifying for exchange at prevailing underwriting standards while we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely with that i will now pass it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat ill wrap this up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide first our strategy emphasizes quality relationship focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on low yielding non relationship balances and enhances our profitability profile while we continue to expect tailwinds from our initiatives in the back half of the year we now expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our original range of to due to current market conditions and previous previously mentioned increase in cre payoffs on the other side of the balance sheet weve been pleased with the momentum weve seen from leading indicators such as household growth quality of accounts and customer satisfaction scores which are foundational for growing your customer base and delivering quality deposit growth were also encouraged by our ongoing cadence of product service and marketing enhancements expected to help build on that and we expect that to help build on our momentum in the coming quarters due to current market conditions we now expect core customer deposit growth to finish at the lower end of our to range that was given previously on the income statement weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and rate environment our latest forecast assumes two fed rate cuts beginning in september and taking these factors into account we now expect net interest income growth of between and in we continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a ph challenged environment and as such weve updated our full year growth guide to plus or minus and finally our disciplined approach to expense remain foundational for the company and with this in mind we continue to expect noninterest expense growth of to in after excluding the impact of fdic special assessment expenses in   and  so with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is from daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you appreciate it good afternoon guys maybe first yes maybe first just to start on the net interest income guidance just back of the envelope as i look at what you guys have done in the first half and the guidance for the full year it looks like theres some solid nim expansion that i would assume or bake in the back half the year guidance am i thinking about that right i think i heard you say the nim expansion youre expecting by the end of the year not sure if we should think about that as kind of stable in the third quarter and then more meaningful in the fourth quarter maybe you can help me just in terms of how im thinking about the dynamics for the rest of the year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes so this is andy ill start this off and then turn it over to derek id say what id emphasize is we expect deposit growth and we expect loan growth in both the third and the fourth quarter so with that were expecting a steady expansion of our nim throughout the second half of the year and so maybe derek put a finer point on that derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes i think youve got it right the nii we expect to sequentially increase both third and fourth quarter and margin expansion in both quarters handful of basis points each one daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right great thanks for that help and then maybe looking at the expense guidance seems like well i guess just first a clarification the adjustment related to the fdic assessment in the second quarter was that a negative adjustment so the operating number was higher than the reported number or i just want to make sure i have that right derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thats correct it was million unwind ph but debit accrual based on receiving the actual bill from the fdic daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right that makes more sense ph with the guide then it still implies a little bit of a pickup i guess in expenses in the back half from what you guys have done in the front half is that should we think about that being kind of personnel driven with the hirings that you guys have been making associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp it is personnel driven and then there is investment in actually acquiring accounts and marketing and segmentation to support ph client acquisition andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp so some of it you would see as some of it you would see as eventually contributing to all the rm hires that weve identified and then some of it would just be seasonal daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right terrific well thanks for the color ill step back derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks daniel operator thank you our next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everybody thanks for taking the question derek maybe if we could walk through the idea of margin expansion in the back half maybe just a little more color on what you expect the puts and takes to be that would allow for a few basis points of expansion in each of the next couple of quarters i guess the background is the context is where youre starting at a little bit of a lower base and i thought the real juice for the margin would have been the sort of the lingering benefits of the securities portfolio restructuring so i guess base question is what is it that allows the margin to expand from here is it fed rate cuts or is it just sort of richer balance sheet mix with the netnet of loan growth as well as core deposit growth how do those dynamics all play out derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes its more mix driven although we run this obviously with the rate cuts each time that matters less and less now we have two rate cuts assumed one in september one in november but more of it is continued trickling up of the investment portfolio the auto book both of those happen and a little bit of the resi both of those happen regardless of a lot of movement from the fed and then as we expect to see these rms bring in ci growth at rates that you saw sort of at the end of phase those that should help us replace some of this lower yield in resi as it rolls off then on the and then you have two levers but clearly the mix on the deposit piece as we expect deposit growth you expect the mix on the wholesale piece to drop but then if you also look at the quarter overquarter change and our interestbearing deposits we already sort of telegraphed those costs coming down a little bit and we expect with a rate cut that thatll allow us from a customer perception standpoint to be a little bit more efficient on that front also associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right thank you for that and then andy or derek just on the lower loan growth expectation i guess im hoping you could unpack a little more just sort of as you weigh how much of this is lower demand versus how much is sort of profitability within the existing growth aspirations and then the company specific nuance that youve always had is the new hires i imagine theyre producing as hoped but would just love to hear your color on sort of the umbrella of all three of those things andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes so this is andy ill take that one first thing id say it is its the lower end of the range so were staying within the range that we forecasted or gave guidance on at the beginning of the year then there are a few puts and takes within that weve been proactively managing our cre book and weve had some payoffs and were fine with that so that takes it down a little bit it puts us in a pretty good position credit wise weve seen the auto industry the application volume has slowed a little bit in that part of what we do but the market has some influence on that however we see our pipelines are up and so derek and i were just discussing this last week we compare phase of our plan with phase and so if you look at that were adding about rms in phase we added roughly rms in phase we are seeing very similar impact in the first six months of that remember its the first six months of that so by the time you hire them they take an application you dont start closing anything or booking anything till third and fourth quarter and so we see a very similar result in that period of time derek i dont know if you can show highlight kind of where we were in phase and what we grew to so just to give an idea ph and the timing derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes yes so we i think right before i started andy was here and then in september our third quarter of we rolled out phase and so i looked at the june before that june 30th and our ci loans were about billion thats billion now and really you grew about a billion that first year really the back half of the first year and then another billion the following year and were sort of seeing the same thing where you maintain the portfolio you have and then as the new hires come in the pipeline builds slowly and then were all eager to see the pullthrough on that and expect the same thing to happen andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and so scott if you wanted the short version versus the readers digest were still within the forecast were slightly low end of that just because auto is a little bit shorter and then cre is a little bit down r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes got it okay thank you very much i appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp all right thanks scott associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 operator thank you our next question is from timur braziler with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hello timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes im just wondering of the planned hire or planned hires how much of that hiring has already taken place andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes thats a great question we are at hires net so net meaning if somebody leaves we actually have to replace that too and so were at hires of hires and i expect that well be at my estimation target is by the end of the first quarter of well be at all hires timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess just maybe going back to the growth expectations for both loans and deposits in the back end of the year i mean both of them imply kind of a meaningful ramp i guess on the loan side and i get rms coming in bringing over their books of business environment does seem soft like is the expectation that cre paydowns slow that auto demand intensifies i guess whats giving you confidence that that loan growth is going to materialize in a more meaningful capacity in seeing as the landscape is still a little bit soft here andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes we have the benefit of seeing our pipelines and so were able to track kind of where they were this time last year we can do it by same quarter prior year and those pipelines are up and typically when you see pipelines grow the loan production and loan balances follow on that we also think that weve had weve monitored pretty closely what weve seen in the cre paydowns and we expect that that net number for cre wont be quite as negative in the second half as the first half so when we look across the board the loan growth doesnt have to be heroic it just has to be a little bit better than it was in the first half and frankly those people that we have hired well really start to get benefit from them in the second half of the year so theres additional dollars there on the deposit side of it the balance sheet we can look at annual trends and we see the back half trend for the company for the last two years we have significantly improved our capabilities on the consumer side and weve added rms on the commercial side and frankly our wealth business is doing quite well on deposit acquisition so both sides of the balance sheet we feel that well be able to fund pretty equally fund our loan growth in the second half what were looking at on the loan number and then funding it on the deposit side associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess just a corollary a corollary on the deposit side whats the implication for noninterest bearing demand how is that progressing ph is that pace of pressure line item maybe abating a little bit and then just wondering if the loan growth is somewhat dependent on the deposit growth manifesting or if that deposit growth doesnt manifest would you continue funding that loan growth with wholesale funding derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so a couple of things i think weve talked about the last two quarters the noninterest bearing deposits bottoming about ph fiveeight billion i think it bottomed about billion we still have the same view and bottomsup forecast telling us that its going to grow a few hundred million between now and the end of the year so i think that is largely intact one of the things and so we have contemplated your other question we did in the fourth quarter about loan growth and deposit growth our loan growth right now is not and strategies is not dependent on deposit growth but we feel confident in both of them we grew deposits quite a bit the second half of last year and outperformed our expectations the first quarter of this year and a little bit of the second quarter is rebounding from that so we have confidence in the tactics but also we dont necessarily want to put the brakes on our gotomarket strategy with the commercial relationship managers who are tasked with getting both and what i mean by that is when we repositioned our securities and sold or the resi real estate and improved our profitability but it also freed up capacity and funding so that if loan opportunities get ahead of the pace of deposit growth we have flexibility there as long as its profitable because the setup for this is driving growth and profitability and that gives us the flexibility to do that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill tag on to that we have to think of what our funding sources and the downside scenario of not hitting your deposit numbers are but make sure you understand that a majority of our growth on the deposit side we expect to come from consumer we have executed on every consumer strategy that we had in the plan every time weve launched a new piece of it weve seen an improvement in retention weve seen an improvement in customer satisfaction which typically leads to people staying so remember that growth is dependent on people staying and adding to it the second part of that is you can start to see what your tactics are and seeing the households accelerate which we have each of the last three months including in this month when that starts to accelerate they bring quality deposits and we measure what the quality of those customers are so between the decreased runoff the improvement from even yearend ph in customer satisfaction leading to decreased runoff and then acquiring new customers that are starting that are higher quality than the year before while we do have a contingency to fund and have loan growth regardless of deposit growth that combined with what weve seen in the trend the last two years gives us the confidence that well be able to fund the loan growth visàvis our deposit growth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and if i can just sneak one more question in just for the remainder kind of planned hiring im just wondering how much of that from an expense standpoint is going to be able to be mitigated with maybe further enhancements reductions on other expenses you guys have done a really nice job kind of keeping the line on associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 expenses over the last four quarters while adding new people is there still capabilities to maybe offset some of the hiring spend or should we see a greater pullthrough from these expected hires into the expense base andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well youre making my job easier right now because i assume our leadership team is listening and we go into every single year saying where do we cut to invest those conversations have started already trying to get out in front of that and so we expect well find areas that we can decrease expenses to invest in where the worlds moving part of where the worlds moving for us is to be local and add to the commercial rms although adding people wont make or break our budget all by itself so that is our approach to business of course everyones battled expense growth and inflation and what that means but that conversation has happened as recently as this morning and meetings that ive had as recently as yesterday with our entire fpa team and we have meetings already scheduled with our executive leadership team to have the same conversation so it is the way that we do business yes and we expect to manage our expenses in in a very similar type of fashion timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens inc please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning good afternoon everybody maybe could you start and talk about the million of office cre loans that matured in the first half of the year in terms of updated appraisals and if those loans remain on the balance sheet today and i asked the question because i think youve got another ph 230millionish set to mature in the back half of the year derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes i would say in terms of the first half of the year it was definitely a mix of some we kept if they met underwriting criteria weve had others that paid off via sale or refinance so its probably a fairly even mix amongst the three and thats kind of how we would look at the rest of the year as well anything that stays on the books that were looking to renew really ph weve got a were looking to reset to updated underwriting standards et cetera and work with clients on that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that and then as a followup page a complete sense improving the returns involves decreasing wholesale funding sources and ive had a couple of investors reach out to me over the last hour and just to cite the increase in the fhlb borrowings which kind of goes against that slide so looking beyond the next couple of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 quarters where do you where would you like to see wholesale funding ph if fhlb advances be as a percentage of your balance sheet derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes so we include in our for the purposes of managing the firm in our definition of wholesale funding we also include brokered cds so we generally try and keep that under or below those three buckets combined terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp terry id just tack on to that by saying thats why ive emphasized that were funding the balance sheet with deposit growth in the second half but to me looking at the second quarter versus first looking at the first and second quarter ph in combinations is important because were able to take steps on wholesale funding in the first quarter when we ph had deposits longer than we expected so that kind of went up and came down our absolute intent is to have budgets and expectations where we are growing our deposits at the same rate as our loans and so thats what i was trying to highlight and the expectation in the second half if you just simply look at that one quarter it doesnt tell the story thats the other reason that we tried to show from the fourth quarter average to the second quarter average its pretty much flat its a good question thank you terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yes thanks andy operator thank you our last question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i did have a question on that trend that terry just asked but just to clarify i mean its late july youre starting to see those deposits rebounding already is that fair i understand the first quarter to second quarter normalization does that rebound indiscernible associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes it has i mean it would be a difficult story to tell if we hadnt seen that already in june heading into july as well and frankly its followed the trend and the forecast that weve had internally yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay any thoughts on what could push you to the higher end of the net interest income range is it as simple as loan growth or is it something else derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes its loan growth i think if we saw fewer payoffs than we currently have rolled up in our forecast on cre and we saw the pipeline mature as the pullthrough come in quicker than what we have currently got penciled in those would both drive it youve seen the pipeline grow as a result of adding all these people that andy was talking about but at the same time we saw pullthrough as deals booked slowed down a little largely because of higher rates so that could easily reverse itself the economy itself is strong so we dont see that the softening in terms of demand driven by gdp growth we dont see that as a as a factor thats slowing anything down in our markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so its possible that lower rates could be a catalyst for some loan growth is that fair derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp its possible or it could be the both lower rates or slower payoffs than what weve got planned jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one andy you cited a little softer demand in the auto dealer network any idea on the cause of that is that just a blip or persistent what do you think andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes no i think the captives have tried to kind of enhance the sales of auto and so they have some offers out there that are pretty that have been fairly aggressive we absolutely wont get out of the primesuper prime business so were not going to flex on that we like it as business for us and its one that actually helps ph the gap the attrition that we plan for on the residential real estate so we wont we dont need to reach there and the average fico pat what was the average fico in june ph deals we are going to pushing like or patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp it was actually over the whole quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes so this is truly a super prime book so its slowed a little bit will that increase in the second half perhaps a little bit but we wont press the accelerator on auto so to say jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay all right andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thats indiscernible can be jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes yes okay all right thanks for the help i appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you there are no further questions in queue andrew j
