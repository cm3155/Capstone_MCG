associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thank you doug and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our yearend earnings call i am andy harmening and im joined here today by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer i want to start things off by sharing highlights for the quarter and then reflecting on as a whole from there derek will walk through an update on margins income statement trends and capital and then pat will provide an update on credit so no matter how you slice it was a statement year in associateds 162year history it was driven by a relentless focus on customers and on our colleagues we executed against our strategic plan with several milestones achieved in we staffed and ramped up new commercial and consumer verticals that have since met or exceeded their initial target giving us a little bit more flexibility to drive balanced loan and balanced deposit growth for the bank we attracted top talent from several major competitors within our footprint and added net new commercial rms during the year giving us momentum as an employer of choice we launched the most significant digital platform upgrade in our companys history with our new associated bank digital platform and then within days we followed that up with a new account opening platform this gives us a much improved digital experience for our customers and the ability to make future enhancements more frequently and leveraging these digital enhancements we officially launched new mass affluent and digital sales strategies giving us the ability to attract and deepen more quality customer relationships all of these efforts have enabled us to drive positive operating leverage improve our returns and serve our customers more efficiently and more effectively and while weve grown a lot in a lot of ways in its important to reiterate that weve done so in a controlled fashion we remain firmly committed to maintaining our discipline around credit quality and expense management these foundational strengths have been developed over the course of a decade and will continue to serve as our foundation as we look to deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders these results also set the table for and in january we continue to be impressed by the strength and resilience of our midwest markets in the face of macro uncertainty unemployment rates remain stable and with wisconsin and minnesota continuing to come in below the national average our consumers remain resilient with increased debit and credit card spending levels in december of versus december of our business customers continue to pursue growth and expansion opportunities where it makes sense but the uncertain macro environment is front and center in all conversations taken together with the rising rate environment these trends have enabled us to enjoy another strong quarter here in  and have given us momentum into the new year we continue to monitor the significant macroeconomic and geopolitical question marks that remain but we believe we put ourselves in a good position to build on our momentum and drive value for our stakeholders without stretching to take additional risk with that id like to highlight a few items outlined on slide our fourth quarter results reflected continued loan and deposit growth further margin expansion and benign credit impacts we once again saw strong loan growth across all major segments but as we anticipated the pace of growth slowed somewhat versus the prior quarter in most key categories based on a combination of our customer activity and our markets the execution of our strategic plan and the rising rate environment our net interest income increased quarteroverquarter and versus the same quarter in the prior year with the expenses held flat for the quarter we once again drove positive operating leverage and we pushed our return on common equity north of for the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 on the credit side we continue to closely monitor our portfolios but fourth quarter trends remain benign during the quarter we saw just basis points of net chargeoffs we did add provision again this quarter but is once again largely a function of our loan growth looking at as a whole our fourth quarter results were a fitting exclamation point on what has turned out to be the most profitable fiscal year in associated banks history through a combination of strength in our markets execution of our growth initiatives and help from rising rates we drove over increase in ptpp income posted doubledigit operating leverage and added nearly billion in high quality loan balances despite a million provisiondriven headwind versus the prior year were still able to drive a increase in our net income available to common equity yearoveryear and while were proud of these accomplishments our focus is on building off this momentum in with that id like to provide a little bit more color around our loan trends slide once again underscores the broad diversified impact of associated loans growth story for the third consecutive quarter we reported growth in nearly every major loan vertical our construction portfolio led the way with the bulk of balanced growth driven by funding of prior commitments and a slowdown in payout payoff activity as opposed to new production we did see broad highquality loan growth in several other businesses but in most cases the pace of growth slowed versus the prior quarter as expected shifting to slide this annual view of our loan trends shows a clearer picture of the broadbased growth and optionality provided by our various lending initiatives as discussed in the past this dynamic reflects the strength of our markets and franchise but it also highlights the diversifying nature of our initiatives this gives us additional levers that we can pull to drive balanced durable growth across the portfolio over time in different economic and in different economic environments without feeling like we need to stretch in one particular area slide provides a bit more color on the status of our strategic initiatives as we discussed last quarter our effort to bolster our commercial ranks with talented rms in markets like milwaukee and chicago have played a significant role in adding quality core commercial loans to our balance sheet while some of the balances came from draws on existing lines we also increased the volume of new commercial relationships by yearover year with a vast majority of new names coming in our core three state footprint this activity helped us achieve our fullyear commercial loan growth target by september but it also sets us up to drive a more holistic relationship that includes deposits treasury management and other services we expect to see additional core commercial loan growth in but at a slower pace compared to our new abl and equipment finance verticals also established solid momentum throughout the year as each team developed their respective pipelines and steadily added balances as a natural fit for our customer base as a result the teams comfortably cleared their million growth target for and we expect to continue growing these businesses in on the consumer front our auto finance team has continued to produce high quality fixed rate loans that help diversify our consumer loan book with decades of experience executing a primesuperprime strategy in a variety of environments this team knows the auto business and their approach is a natural fit for our conservative credit culture with that said ive also stated previously that the diversifying impact of our initiatives give us the ability to scale up or down without having to overindex on any one approach and with that in mind weve intentionally slowed our auto production rate slightly to reflect current market conditions as we head into we also continue to expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of the year and allinall we expect to drive total period end of loan growth of to in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 turning to slide we highlight our fourth quarter deposit trends on an average basis we grew deposits by quarteroverquarter and by versus the fourth quarter of this growth came despite inflation and increasing competitive pressures in the market and was a reflection of the strategic actions weve taken to cultivate our lowcost granular deposit base and attract and deepen holistic relationships as weve discussed in the past we recognize that generating lowcost funding is more crucial than ever and particularly as we look to fund our growth strategies on the lending side while we did add brokered cds and network deposits to our balances in  a majority of our balance growth for the year was driven by core customer deposits were comfortable flexing wholesale and network funding levels in the shortterm but we expect to hold this type of funding in check as we move through the year we continue to monitor the competitive environment closely and remain confident in our ability to fund the bank at a reasonable cost in and beyond based on the initiatives we have in ph place slide highlights an annual average view of our deposit flows in we saw average deposit growth for the 11th consecutive year despite the steadily increasing inflation inflationary and competitive pressures we saw throughout the year we were still able to grow average annual deposits by on a quarterly yearoveryear basis core customer deposits were once again the driving force behind our growth led by savings money market and interestbearing demand categories shifting to slide there is no denying that the competitive pressures will be amplified in as the battle for deposits continues thats why weve been hard at work for the past year on several initiatives designed to help us cultivate customer relationships fund growth with lower cost core deposits in fact some of these initiatives have already started to have an impact in we drove a increase in commercial rms compared to year end this in turn led to a yearoveryear increase in new customer names many of which brought deposits and nonloan business to the bank as renewed our focus on driving holistic relationships these efforts have been complemented by a sharpened focus on businesses that allow us to deepen those commercial relationships including treasury management where weve increased sales activity by hsa where weve hired a new national sales director and other depositcentric businesses on the consumer side we launched a new digital account opening platform providing customers and prospects with a modern simplified digital storefront this upgrade gave us the confidence to launch our new acquisitionfocused mass affluent and digital sales initiatives in the fourth quarter while its still early weve seen promising initial production in the segment such as savings and cds with each of these initiatives launching over the course of some have impacted our results more than others but all of them are expected to provide a fullyear impact in and to further capitalize on this momentum in weve shifted our marketing spend from a sponsorship focus to a customer acquisition with a new brand campaign set to launch next month and beginning in the second quarter we intend to launch a new product or digital service every quarter in with an eye towards increased customer and deposit acquisition in summary with the battle for deposits continuing to heat up weve acted we are actively pursuing a variety of levers to drive core customer funding at a reasonable cost ive directly experienced the launch of similar programs several times in previous stops im confident that we can achieve positive results at associated regardless of the environment in we expect to drive total core customer deposit growth to finally on slide our initiatives have helped generate strong revenues for our company in coupled with our diligent management of expenses weve continued to deliver significant operating leverage and ptpp income associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 growth for the full year of our ptpp income grew by we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage in with that ill pull up there and hand it over to derek meyer our chief financial officer to provide further detail on our margin revenue and income statement trends for the quarter derek derek meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy slide highlights our yield trends and the asset sensitive nature of our balance sheet on the asset side average earning asset yields continue to expand meaningfully in the fourth quarter over the course of the year earning asset yields increased by basis points or roughly of the increase weve seen in the fed funds target rate over the same period reflecting our core asset sensitivity on the liability side interestbearing liability costs have now increased basis points or roughly of the move in fed funds target while the pace of liability costs started to increase in the back half of the year this increase was largely has largely tracked with our expectations and we continue to monitor these costs closely despite the rising liability costs in the fourth quarter we continue to see significant quarteroverquarter expansion in our net interest margin as shown on slide im sorry slide we view this as a reflection of our recent loan growth coupled with our structural asset sensitivity during  our net interest margin expanded by basis points versus the prior quarter this expansion equated to a million lift in our net interest income versus  and on a fullyear basis our nii grew by or million as compared to moving to slide several factors have enabled us to continue benefiting from the current rate environment as weve discussed these factors include our natural assets sensitivity reduce reliance on wholesale network funding versus the prior rate cycle and our ability to manage interestbearing deposit betas while we do expect the betas to continue increasing into these broader dynamics have us poised to continue benefiting in the nearterm with that said the lack of clarity around the macroeconomic forecast carries significant uncertainty for the industry into as a result we continue to take meaningful actions to manage through this uncertainty and reduce our interest rate risk over the back half of we executed over billion interest rate swaps we do not intend to call the peak on the interest rate environment in but we will continue to take reasonable steps over time to dampen our asset sensitivity and manage our downside rate risk while the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain our current expectations are for shortterm interest rates to rise by basis points following each of the fomc meetings in february and march with a rate cut in october based on these assumptions and the balance sheet dynamics i just discussed we expect net interest income to grow between and in shifting to slide noninterest income continues to see pressure from marketdriven headwinds weve discussed throughout the year and the customerfriendly fee adjustments we implemented in  of in the fourth quarter modest increases in wealth management fees and boli income and stabilization in mortgage banking were more than offset by reduction in service charges other feebased revenue and capital markets also contributing to the quarteroverquarter decrease was a million investment securities gain recognized in  associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 as a reminder we expected to see deposit account fee income moderate beginning in the third quarter of based on implementation of the od nsf changes we announced earlier in the year these changes were both proactive and pro customer in nature when coupled with our relationship focused deposit initiatives they give us additional confidence in our ability to strengthen our lowcost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability profile in with this in mind we expect total noninterest income to remain under pressure throughout the year with compression over to in moving to slide fourth quarter expenses came in at million as we continue to scale up our investments in people technology and business development and advertising for the full year expenses grew by versus in support of our initiatives despite this expense growth our efficiency ratio steadily improved throughout the year on a pointtopoint fte basis we now decrease our efficiency ratio by approximately compared to the same period last year reflecting our ability to maintain expense discipline while driving higher revenues this point is further underscored by the chart on the lower right which shows our noninterest expense actually decreased in as a percent of assets while we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations we remain committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth on an ongoing basis we will continue to pursue opportunities to shift expense from underperforming assets to more productive means where possible we expect total noninterest expense growth of approximately to in shifting to slide we continue to manage capital levels towards our target ranges while supporting growth we remain comfortable with our capital levels given the enhanced profitability we drove throughout given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm interest rates to remain elevated into we now expect to maintain tce in to range we expect cet1 to land between and i will now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide weve utilized the moodys november baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions moodys baseline forecast remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes continued fed rate action minimal gdp growth and modest employment deceleration in on a dollar basis our acll settled at million at yearend this figure represents another increase in the prior quarter but that build was once again largely driven by significant growth in our loan portfolios in alignment with this dynamic our reserves to loan ratio increased just basis points from to during the quarter moving to slide our quarterly credit trends remained largely benign during the fourth quarter nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans and net chargeoffs all decreased from the prior quarter and the same time period a year ago the slight increase in delinquencies as compared to recent periods largely reflects a normalization of our maturing auto book following a million provision build in  we added another million of provision in the fourth quarter as mentioned this provision build was largely a function of loan growth and not a reflection of larger credit quality associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 concerns within the portfolio with representing one of the strongest loan growth years in our history id like to reiterate that this growth has not come from an expansion of our credit box or overextending ourselves in one particular area the recent growth in our loan portfolios has been driven by investments in our core business growth of core relationships and expanding our engagement with familiar customer segments our strong credit foundation in place at associated today was built over the course of a decade we have an experienced team that continues to work hard to bolster this foundation with a disciplined underwriting culture improved risk controls and a proactive approach to portfolio management with that said we are fully aware of the warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in our credit discipline with current underwriting reflecting elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor cost to name a few of the economic concerns as well as continued interest rate sensitivity analysis across the portfolio going forward we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk grades economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you pat before we move to qa i want to reiterate a couple of points from our discussion this afternoon on slide first we remain confident in our ability to drive quality balanced loan growth throughout the year but not at the pace we saw in with that in mind we expect total end of period loan growth between and in we continued to work on dampening our asset sensitivity but we expect to continue to benefit from the rising rate environment in the nearterm based on our current forecasts for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed actions we expect to deliver net interest income growth of between and in lastly we continue to invest strategically in people and technology and expect noninterest expense to grow by to in as always we remain disciplined on expenses as we work to continue delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jared shaw from wells fargo please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good evening andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting on loan growth you had great growth in construction this year what is the visibility look like into the pipeline heading into and are there any areas youre focusing on or shying away from as we go forward andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah thats a really good question ill just speak to the cre construction that thats a point in time rather than a trend in my mind we saw the growth because of the funding up of some of the construction loans and then a brief hesitation on some folks to refinance in the permanent market as opposed to new production that we put out there we see very little new production particularly on the industrial side of the equation the pipelines are significantly down in commercial real estate so i think youll see that category moderate as we go throughout the year we expect to have very balanced growth between consumer and commercial and thats purposeful as you know we have several levers right now so we can start to maximize higher performing portfolios portfolios that are more holistic as opposed to single deals businesses that will deemphasize thirdparty origination already have we did that in december and that pipelines frankly flowing through in december and diminishing as we go into january so we expect ci to continue to be solid but really within our footprint and with holistic relationships and weve already seen the evidence of that as weve brought on rms throughout the year thats why we feel like to bring bringing those rms on during the year it has a fullyear effect in and even stronger focus on ancillary business including deposits and tm jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as we look at the as you look at margin and spread income i guess where do you where could we see margin sort of peaking out peaking with some of the changes you took and then just to confirm is the nii growth target is that fullyear over fullyear or is that from annualized fourth quarter levels associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp jared this is derek its those are fullyear numbers and so in our guidance on nii its based on the yield curve assumptions we made and the loan growth that we outlined in terms of expectations so were not giving guidance on where were calling the peak on rates we sort of talked about that i talked about that in the script when we saw when we as we went into this year and looked at all the planned the rate moves even while we were planning in december and even in the first week of january i think its pretty dangerous to try and call that what were really anchored on are the fundamentals theyre going to drive durable margin we came into this very asset sensitive we are going to remain asset sensitive but we are taking some of that asset sensitivity down which we talk a little bit about with our hedging but we also are putting a stake in the ground with the outperformance on deposit growth and you saw that this year you put into that into perspective with the initiatives we put in place that weve outlined on slide many of which have yearoveryear impacts on our ability to generate deposit growth beyond just interest rates then you have new initiatives that will have a fullyear impact this year going out and then you start to fill in the blanks behind that other kind of funding that we might need to support that level of loan growth were still committed to our loan to deposit ratio and we still expect our wholesale funding to be below what we had historically during the last time we had rising rates jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah but to get to the nii guide i guess that implies a pretty significant step down in margin as we as you go through the year is ph not the right way to be looking at that even though youre still asset sensitive and youre still expecting a little bit of rate moves up earlier on derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think what yearoveryear its ph not a fullyear basis its a step up i think when you look at sequential quarter youre still trying to everybodys trying to figure out where is your peak quarter and were not making that call jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then on capital should we expect that you could be more active in capital management to potentially get to the lower end of that range or is that just a function of the natural movement of the balance sheet and we shouldnt really be expecting a buyback or any significant change to capital return strategies derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah were not looking to change our capital return strategies theres still dividend and organic growth jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks ill step back thank you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks jared operator our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to also ask about sort of nii and trajectory there so i guess that just in looking at the guidance suggests that the quarterly average of nii for the fullyear will be about million a quarter less than what we did in the fourth quarter ph now granted fourth quarter was just an extraordinarily strong number but maybe do you have derek a sense for how nii in dollar terms would project that throughout the year in other words can we would we stay high for say the first half of the year as long as the fed is still raising rates and we get that benefit and then theres a taper off or was there anything in the fourth quarter that would have kind of elevated it and then we maybe step down but have a steadier dollar average throughout the year derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i dont again i dont think im going to be that specific i think we recognized that deposit betas are catching up when exactly they which quarter they catch up and you see some of that quarterly compression i dont again i dont think we have that called so i think were more comfortable giving the fullyear guidance and with the options weve got we think we can get to that number r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and then just given some of the hedging actions that youve taken or took in the second half of the year do you have sort of a sense where like maybe what might represent a floor for the margin once it does begin to taper off by any chance derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no we dont i think you can back into some scenarios using the our asset sensitivity that we have there if you do some a little bit of ph cowboy math you know that a 25basispoint shock might impact you million million on a fullyear basis and you can see weve been managing that down its a combination of the swaps and the evolution of the portfolio i think thats as far as id go with that the i think its tough to call floor r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 one of the things that we that everybodys faced with and i know everybody on the call is interested in is how do you continue with the hedging strategy with the shape of the yield curve and so if your natural balance sheet is offering you protection or is with some of the growth weve got in the auto book then you might start thinking about swaps or floors but were not at that point yet and were still monitoring each quarter and we like the progress were making and we want to stay r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp asset sensitive r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you guys very much really appreciate it again andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe another stab at the nii from a different point of view but just looking at the balance sheet would you say youre at the point with excess liquidity now where you expect that the balance sheet growth to more or less matched loan growth at this point derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so the way id characterize it i mean thats a shorthand i havent done that view we are going to we have bottomed out on securities and as a percent of fixed assets so there is a component of our funding plan and deposit growth that includes supporting investments and securities so it probably gets you closer to what youre talking about associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah that makes sense okay and then i appreciate your comment on expecting positive operating leverage in is there any kind of environment from a rate perspective that would restrict that the ability to achieve that or you feel pretty comfortable with that guidance andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah look you know that the rate question the yield question the impact in the market is being asked on almost every call and just there are obvious reasons and thats because theres a lot of contradictory information out there to understand what the future might be with regards to what we see in our portfolio the tailwind that we have from the growth that weve already experienced in heading into the initiatives that we have that show that were able to fund a little bit weve been able to fund on the deposit side a little bit ahead of what the marketplace is our ability to shift expenses from a low return area to a higher return area all those things at this stage give us confidence in what our forecast is the economy doesnt seem to be falling down quickly in our mind and there could be a slow roll towards that we also see pipelines and have conversations about automation and what that can mean on the loan demand side and we have a lot of levers there thats really choosing which levers we want to go forward with but we believe those exist those will match largely what our deposit funding is and that is our expectation and the other point that ill make is and i know were talking about but were talking about actions were taking as a company to structurally change how we fund our balance sheet over time so that starts to give you more and more confidence that we have opportunity for improvement as we drive those core deposits that means that you over time lessen the wholesale funding so the answer the short answer is yes we have as much confidence since we can have in an uncertain world on what will happen because we have many tactics and strategies both on the loan side the deposit side but also where we invest our capital where invest our money on people and also where we invest in digital versus shift in the digital spend into from the shifting to digital spend from physical spend so taking all those things together in the environment were in we today have a confidence level in the forecast daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate all the color andy just lastly on the expense guide it came in below actually what i was looking for now just curious if in terms of the pace of expense growth through the year if theres anything that we need to keep in mind or if its just you know youre considering rather steady growth through the year thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp are you disappointed thats not hired daniel sorry indiscernible daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc no associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no the reason that we feel confident in this space is because weve taken an approach frankly since ive been here which is we look very very strongly at the expenses that we have and say are we spending in the right place lets start with that and then we cut expenses in those areas going into the year weve targeted in the first year taking out i think is roughly million and we have a similar approach going into the year on what do we do in our physical branches what are we doing in thirdparty origination which has less typically less margin and return on it then we took action with our staffing and as we brought that ph lever down so its not just a function of investing in new areas its also simultaneously taking the expense off the table in areas that cannot yield as much to us on the longterm so when we say to is because we are taking actions proactively to cut expenses before we grow expenses as long as the increase in expense leads to an increase in revenue we will continue on that path but we will ask the team also if it doesnt where do we proactively slow down the investment and that exercise is already a course of business for our team so to answer your question i like the discipline an environment where weve been able to grow revenue i very much like the discipline that weve had with regards to expenses we also happen to bring in a cfo that has years and years of experience as the head of fpa i will tell you thats not on accident bringing discipline to execution is very important not often talked about but incredibly important when youre trying to balance growth and bring in that discipline towards expense management so i feel quite good about the to range and i will tell you were not immune from the issues that everybody has which is consistently looking at different areas of your business and knowing that were competing for talent so we have factored in increases that we have already had to make or are going to make with regards to talent talent in key areas to retain them daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great appreciate all that thats all for me thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good afternoon in prior presentations you provided the loan growth outlook by those three categories commercial down to auto finance so i guess my question is kind of in an ideal world what bucket would you like to grow and how would you like that that mix of growth to be in and is auto finance kind of the filler so to speak because to allow you to hit that target given just some of the lower returns that we hear in the marketplace andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah its a great call out terry and what i would say is we have a lot of levers and we want to see where the year is going as opposed to going in the middle of the year and say were going to go hard in this asset class only associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 to find out that maybe that is not the area offering the best returns and so we look very closely at our mortgage business now our mortgage business in production is off so far versus the prior january so how do i want to forecast that out in a year where were seeing pay downs at historic lows and were still seeing that growth so were trying to pull these levers through but what we know is we have the ability to manage what our loan growth number is because weve taken action with quality people and quality segments and then were going to look at what the returns in those areas are so what id give is guidance during this period ill also say assetbased lending and equipment finance while theyre new businesses to us theyre middle market that is middle market lending all day long so to call those out at this point we feel like its part of our business its how were selling its integrated into our process then well look at the consumer side and try to create balanced growth between that residential and then pick up the slack with our auto lending im not sure id call it a filler product and im certain our division would not really like that as the label i would say we have professionals that look for prime paper that have low risk to them in a high risk higher risk potentially environment so i like the position were in there so id finish that commentary by saying we have optionality within where we are our goal over time is to drive margin we think we have an opportunity we look at that very closely in the industry and we see what that mix shift can be so the idea is that we can drive higher yielding assets over time but for what i would like to do is drive balanced growth we are not the auto lending company we are a company that can choose between consumer and commercial and try to balance the growth between those two while maximizing the areas on margins so thats a little bit of why we havent broken that out going to the year its also the reason that i have confidence that we can hit some of our projections terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc appreciate that and then just as a followup i mean what do you say to investors who are concerned with what they may feel is late cycle loan growth and how those loans may perform in a downturn when i look at page that righthand category theres just been significant growth for a bank of your size in commercial and cre and construction and even auto finance or especially auto finance whats the whats your response andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i would say if you look at months you probably started too late and what i would say is we worked on fundamentally changing the balance sheet to derisk in over a decade and specifically i could call out for instance our residential real estate portfolio were oversized in residential real estate but were oversized in a portfolio that is prime and superprime in a market that doesnt have large fluctuations up and down so inherently our balance sheet is less risky in our opinion going into that and that has seen some growth when we look at auto and coin that out specifically it is the oldest new business ive ever experienced and by that i mean we have people that joined us with decades of experience across the board in that space not only do they have decades of experience we also brought the data the historical data to understand what the how the portfolio operates so we know how that operates then on top of that we went into prime and superprime and ill specifically say to the investors that by traditional standards of that book is prime and superprime if we take a scorecard approach which takes a lot of other factors and we think is a better way to look at it its of our portfolio and we know that because we can check that against historical data so those would be the things that i would say with regards to what the portfolio is the next thing id say is we did not expand our credit box anywhere in fact weve tightened up our credit box as weve seen the world change so weve tightened that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 up on commercial real estate underwriting weve tightened that up on commercial underwriting and we already had a pretty conservative approach so weve added balances and areas that we know quite well i get a lot of passion on this im looking across the table at our chief risk chief credit risk officer i think maybe he should make a final comment on this patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp no i would agree with everything you said we did not change our credit box relative to the growth youve seen and we are continuing to look at like as andy said whats going on in the marketplace whether thats interest rate adjustments whether its sizing whether its underwriting to an exit so all that stuff is kind of evolves in relative to the marketplace and what its also done is the growth youre seeing again it kind of reflects the core client that weve been focusing on so we didnt stretch to add in a new vertical we didnt stretch to add in some new geography or anything like that so we feel were comfortable with the core focus we had coupled with the adjustments were making to reflect whats going on in the economy terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good question thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon guys patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp hello derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 just a quick followup on that for you pat on slide you mentioned some normalization driving the delinquencies up and i know these are small numbers but what do you expect that to look like in a couple of quarters just so were not surprised by that patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think its going to revert back to kind of the prepandemic numbers how long that takes a year ago we were we thought maybe wed be there by now but its not i think again as weve mentioned the portfolio continues to outperform were seeing the loan book the auto indirect auto book is a little over a year now so were kind of reaching some normalization there but really the rest of some of the consumer delinquencies that we saw this quarter are really small and we havent really seen a significant trends so when we get back to say numbers is still to be determined jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc but that helps i was just going to ask about the delinquencies as well nonfinancial questions for you andy the brand campaign you talked about what is the message on that and what do you think needs to refreshed or emphasized in terms of messaging andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i sure hate to spoil it for you jon i feel like im going to email those commercials to you though as were launching but what i will say the interesting part to me is we brought in a new chief marketing and product officer and his expertise is in customer research and so when you launch something thats about the brand first you want to know what youre about but then you also want to know what your customers are about and so we are going to combine what the messaging is thats kind of true to us and what we do but its also going to be whats in it for me and as we think about marrying a marketing message we also think about our product execution so we will the significance of the products that were going to launch in the second third and fourth quarter should marry up with that brand message and it does thats a big deal and then when you think about the triumvirate you think about the new branding you think about the product and then you think about digital because at the end of the day youre driving them to your digital platform and you need to be relevant and the final thing ill say on that is you want to make sure youre relevant particularly to the people that are switching banks and those are typically people that are years old and under so that is right in the sweet spot of what were doing in digital its right in the sweet spot of the ease of use and satisfaction we are seeing from our digital account opening it will be consistent with the message and it will also be with those folks in that range have told us are important from a product standpoint so its been a heck of a lot of work going into all of that and weve been on that path for more than months even before our new product and marketing executive came on board but its coming together nicely so im making a note to myself email jon of all the commercials jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im sure ill see him indiscernible andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 thanks jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just a couple more cleanups just back on terrys question on slide on auto i understand what youre saying there but do you expect auto to grow very materially from here youve kind of achieved what you wanted to get in terms of some of the portfolio diversification andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i would say that we have the option to grow it i would say that we have to look at our mortgage portfolio that was initially set up as a natural hedge to a decreasing ph mortgage emphasis and were seeing right now why thats important and so we believe that it will have growth in the exact number on that will be dependent upon what our overall position is what the other categories do what mortgage specifically does what we can fund in liquidity as well so a little bit too early to put a finer point on that which is why we really ive kind of message that its more of a balanced growth between commercial and consumer jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right ill just leave it at that thanks guys i appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp all right thank you operator there are
