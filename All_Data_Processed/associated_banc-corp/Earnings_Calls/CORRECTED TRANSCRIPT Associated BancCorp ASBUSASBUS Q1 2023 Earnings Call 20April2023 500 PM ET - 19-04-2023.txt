associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thank you shomali and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us im andy harmening and im joined here today by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer id like to start things off by sharing some financial highlights from the quarter and then from there derek will walk through an update on margin income statement trends and capital then pat will provide an update on credit then in light of the recent turmoil in the banking industry weve also pulled together some additional information that underscores the stability of our markets and the durability of our business model so while these past five weeks have generated a wide range of headlines about regional banks and financial service industry in general we can still say that associated bank continues to operate from a position of strength and it starts with our markets as the largest bank headquartered in wisconsin weve been operating largely in conservative diversified midwest markets for more than years including metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns and its important to note we serve a stable and diversified customer base with deposits from all banking segments consumer high net worth small businesses large corporate government agencies and commercial real estate and here in the early part of these markets have remained resilient in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment unemployment rates remain stable with wisconsin and minnesota continuing to come in below the national average the consumer remains healthy and our business customers continue to seek ways to expand and optimize their operations where it makes sense this backdrop has enabled us to stay on offense with our initiatives and while i like these initiatives and companies strategic focus coming into the year i like them even more right now as weve discussed our customer and deposit acquisition initiatives began well over a year ago and over that time weve demonstrated an ability to execute as a company and after delivering the most profitable year in our companys history in weve carried that momentum forward in with several key milestones during the first quarter in february we launched our new champion of you brand campaign to support our customer acquisition strategy with television radio and digital ads the campaign demonstrates our commitment to helping our customers communities and our colleagues become financially stronger in march we launched a new grace zone for the consumer and business accounts that are overdrawn up to helping our customers when life brings the unexpected challenge we also continue to build momentum in our recently launched deposit initiatives such as our digital sales platform our mass affluent strategies that give us the ability to attract and deepen more quality customer relationships all of these efforts are positioned as to drive positive operating leverage enhance our profitability and meet the needs of our customers indiscernible and while we like the progress weve made on our initiatives maintaining discipline with regards to credit risk expense management and operational risk that is the foundation of our company these foundational strengths will continue to be our focus as we deliver enhanced value and provide a source of stability for our stakeholders so with that id like to highlight the key results for the first quarter on slide our first quarter results reflected the continued expansion of our balance sheet strong profitability and stable credit impact loan balances continue to grow in each of our major segments but as expected the pace of that growth has slowed compared to the trends associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 we saw in the back half of as we continue to execute our strategic plan and benefit from rising rates we once again delivered strong net interest income and net interest margin north of we also saw a slight increase in our noninterest income while our expenses declined from the prior quarter taken together these inputs helped us drive positive operating leverage while delivering ptpp income of million and return on tangible common equity above we are continuing to monitor asset quality closely but our credit trends in the first quarter remain favorable we saw just basis points of net chargeoffs during the quarter and added basis points of acll despite an million provision for the quarter net income available to common still reflected a increase compared to the same period a year ago with that id like to provide a little more detail on our loan trends as shown on slide the diversifying impacts of our strategic plan have continued to drive broad highquality loan growth across all major segments weve now reported growth in nearly every major loan category for four consecutive quarters however this growth has slowed as compared to the strong pace we saw in this has been especially true for areas such as auto and cre nonetheless weve continued to add balances in consumer verticals such as auto and mortgage and in several of our commercial businesses as weve seen over the past couple of quarters this dynamic is being influenced by the funding of prior commitments and a slowdown in payoff activity on an interperiod basis our mortgage warehouse business led the way in the first quarter but we would not expect this trend to continue over the remainder of the year now as weve discussed over the past several quarters one of the benefits of our lending initiatives is that theyve given us more flexibility to drive returns without stretching on credit this also enabled us to decrease our reliance on lower yielding nonrelationship asset classes with this in mind we made the decision to exit the third partyoriginated mortgage business in  this tpo business has historically represented about a third of our mortgage production and while the loans have been highquality they are lower margin than our retail mortgage loans are more susceptible to prepayments and have relatively low relationship value put it in context we originated approximately billion of these loans in and we expect originate less than million in as we wind down this business to focus on other areas that enable us to optimize returns over time given current market conditions we now expect total loan growth of between and in shifting to slide we highlight our deposit trends for the first quarter clearly this was a very unique quarter for the entire industry with deposits already at a premium in the current rate environment the events of the past few weeks have added significant volatility for regional banks across the country despite those macro trends our core customer deposit balances decreased by less than and our retail deposits actually increased slightly for the quarter like most of the industry we did see some shortterm volatility from a subset of uninsured deposits in march but those flows have stabilized we view this as a result of stability and resilience of our markets the diverse granular deposit base of our company has cultivated over the course of several decades and our recent efforts to attract and deepen customer relationship with digital tools and product enhancements on an end of period basis our total deposits grew compared to the prior quarter and compared to the same period a year ago we remain comfortable flexing wholesale network funding levels in the short term but we expect to hold this type of funding in check as we move through the year we remain confident in our ability to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 fund our growth at a reasonable cost in and beyond based on our inflight initiatives with that said based on current market conditions we now expect to drive total core customer deposit growth of to finally on slide our team is once again up to deliver strong revenue for the first quarter and when combined with diligent management of expenses weve been able to deliver consistent positive operating leverage and strong ptpp income in the first quarter ptpp income of million represented a increase as compared to the same period a year ago we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage during with that ill hand it over to derek meyer our chief financial officer to provide further detail on our margin income statement and capital trends for the quarter derek derek meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy slide highlights our asset sensitivity and liability rate trends throughout the first quarter average earning asset yields once again expanded meaningfully in the first quarter due to rising rates and the asset sensitive nature of our balance sheet versus the fourth quarter of total earning asset yields have now increased by basis points or roughly of the increase in fed funds target rate over the same period on the liability side interestbearing liability costs have now increased by basis points since the fourth quarter of or roughly of the move in fed funds target consistent with the rest of the industry weve seen the pace of liability costs continue to increase into the first quarter this scurve effect has unfolded largely as expected but the pace accelerated in the response to feds aggressive actions to fight inflation we have also seen betas increase from the success of our efforts to attract and deepen relationships in areas such as commercial deposits wealth management and mass affluent these deposits often carry a higher beta by nature but nonetheless were pleased with our initial momentum in these businesses moving to slide we continued to deliver strong net interest income in the first quarter but the number has come down slightly versus fourth quarter as rising liability costs outpaced rising asset yields during the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter our net interest income decreased by while our margin compressed by basis points with that said our margin profile has transformed significantly over the past months and were taking steps to drive more durable margin over time as compared to the same period a year ago our net interest income increased by in the first quarter and our nim increased by basis points moving to slide we continue to take gradual steps to lock in a more durable margin profile and reduce our interest rate risk over time first weve taken steps to reduce our interest rate risk by gradually layering in swaps over the past three quarters given ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic picture in the nearterm rate environment we do not intend to call the peak on the interest rate environment in but we will continue to take reasonable steps over time to dampen our asset sensitivity and manage our downside risk within our core balance sheet weve added highquality liquid securities to take advantage of rising rates were also continuing to manage our deposit costs while actively working to bolster our funding base of lowcost core customer relationship deposits with that said the macro outlook remains uncertain our current expectations assume one additional 25basis point fed funds increase in may with 225basis point decreases in september and november respectively based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we now expect net interest income growth of between to in on slide we highlight that we continue to build our securities book in the first quarter to align with our to target throughout the past year the yields on our investments have risen steadily with the rate associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 environment but weve reined in durations to reduce our longerterm rate risk we also reduced exposure to unrealized losses in aoci during the quarter after adjusting our cet1 capital ratio to include the impacts of aoci this impact would have represented an 84basis point hit to cet1 at yearend that gap has been reduced to basis points in march as a percentage of total assets we built our investment security and cash positions to roughly during this quarter we continue to target investments to total assets of between to in shifting to slide noninterest income grew slightly in the first quarter despite the ongoing pressure from marketdriven headwinds and customerfriendly fee adjustments that we faced for the past several quarters modest increases in mortgage banking income and other fee income reduced other feebased revenue offset reductions in service charges cardbased fees boli income and capital markets our relative noninterest income growth versus prior quarter was also impacted by a million investment securities loss recognized in the prior quarter while noninterest income stabilized quartertoquarter we now expect total noninterest income to contract by between and versus this anticipated compression is driven by current market dynamics and moderation in deposit account fee income due to customerfriendly od and sf changes made in the back half of these proactive changes give us additional confidence in our ability to strengthen our lowcost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability profile in and beyond moving to slide our first quarter expenses came in at million a decrease versus the prior quarter despite our ongoing investments in people and technology our ftee efficiency ratio rose slightly from the fourth quarter but at it remains more than percentage points lower than the same period a year ago additionally our noninterest expense decreased basis points as a percent of total assets from prior quarter and basis points versus the same period a year ago these proof points underscore our commitment to maintaining expense discipline as we continue to make progress against our growth strategy while we continue to invest in strategies to support these growth aspirations in we are committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth on an ongoing basis we will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize our expense base where possible with that in mind we now expect total noninterest expense growth of approximately in shifting to slide we continue to support the companys growth while managing capital levels towards our target ranges despite recent volatility in the marketplace our capital ratios grew versus the prior quarter we also saw a meaningful increase in our tangible book value per share driven in part by our enhanced profitability profile we remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look out over the remainder of the year given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm rates to remain elevated in the nearterm we continue to expect tce to land in the to range by yearend and cet1 to land between and ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide the credit update patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide weve utilized the moodys february baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes continued fed rate action minimal gdp growth in the labor market cooling in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 at the end of the first quarter our acll landed at million this figure represents a million increase from the prior quarter largely driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends accordingly our reserves to loan ratio increased basis points from to during the quarter moving to slide our quarterly credit trends remained stable during the first quarter we did see nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans increase slightly from the fourth quarter but both measures are down as compared to the same period a year ago delinquencies decreased on both a whole dollar basis and as a percentage of total loans as compared to the fourth quarter after posting a million provision in  we added another million of provision in the first quarter as mentioned this ph provisionability a function of loan growth limited credit movement and macro trends given recent volatility in the industry id like to take the opportunity to reiterate that the recent growth in our loan portfolios has been driven by investments in our core business growth of core relationships and expanding our engagement with familiar customer segments our experienced team continues to adhere to a disciplined underwriting culture and proactive approach to portfolio management we remain focused on the uncertainty in the macro economy and vigilant with current underwriting reflecting elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor costs just to name a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to monitoring the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis across the bank going forward we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk rates economic condition loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you look given recent events in the industry we have included a few supplemental slides that underscore the strength and stability of our franchise first on page our deposit portfolio is very granular by nature with a large percentage of our deposits coming from consumers small business and other insured depositors after removing collateralized deposits uninsured deposits represent only of our total base we have enough liquidity for coverage of these deposits and we can access of that coverage as soon as tomorrow without liquidating any securities on the commercial side no single sector represents more than of our total deposits with the largest sector being public municipalities additionally we have no material exposure to the banks in other parts of the country that have recently failed on slide we provide additional information regarding our liquidity sources as of yesterday as mentioned on the prior page we have enough readily available funding to cover of our uninsured uncollateralized deposits but if we include all liquidity sources that number increases to in summary we feel very comfortable with the levels of uninsured uncollateralized deposits we have at associated and were also comfortable with our liquidity levels moving to slide our conservative approach to credit has been honed over the course of the past years and weve built a diverse portfolio of highquality loans across our consumer business and corporate customer bases cre is no different in building our cre portfolio we have focused on partnering with wellknown associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 developers in stable midwest markets approximately of our cre portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties office loans represent less than of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio we are weighted towards suburban class a properties while we continue to monitor this portfolio closely we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach and the markets that we operate in with that id like to reiterate a couple points from our discussion this afternoon on slide first remain confident in our ability to drive balanced loan growth throughout the year but the pace is expected to slow given current market conditions with that in mind we now expect total period end of loan growth between and in were pleased with the initial results of our deposit initiatives and remain confident in our ability to attract and deepen customer relationships in and beyond with that said based on current market conditions we now expect to drive total core customer deposit growth of approximately to and while were taking steps to dampen our asset sensitivity we expect to continue to benefit from the rising rate environment in the nearterm based on our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas fed action we now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between and in and lastly we continue to invest strategically in people and technology and we now expect noninterest expense to grow by approximately in in fact we have already taken action to drive to this new target and as always we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters with that shomali lets open it up for questions question and answer section operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey maybe just on the billion of deposits that weve seen so far this quarter can you give a little breakdown of what categories those are coming in and is it similar beta should we expect i guess beta going through to the next few quarters will be similar to what we saw this quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp oh are you talking about slide jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp okay yeah sure so what weve done since the end of the quarter really started in the middle of march was continue to look at ways of getting liquidity just immediately available and so that we could accelerate any kind of coverage that we had for any events and as a result of doing that we had cut plenty of liquidity coverage available and this really speaks to it on the next page on in brokered cds and we decided to issue brokered cds which is what that deposit growth is and term out our fhlb shortterm funding and create secured liquidity that way be available immediately so thats what were trying to capture on those two pages jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then when we look at the guidance for the core deposit growth of that to that implies obviously a slowdown a slowdown from here derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then in terms of the cost of those i mean we should assume that that core beta is still at the higher level andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah and to be clear the to is customer deposits as opposed to net worth or brokered so its exclusive of that and the first quarter we were just under decrease in customer deposits we think well make that up and grow in the neighborhood of to for the year the other thing ill mention on those brokered deposits the way that derek and our finance team were able to handle that was really just an opportunity to increase liquidity but not really have any significant increase in terms of cost to the bank jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess trying to piece together some of the components of guidance does that imply that quarterly net interest income should be sort of flat from here i mean clearly well see some margin pressure but i mean overall nii is that sort of flat at these levels or how should we think about that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think well one if we look at the size of the drop we think about basis points of that comes from a mix change in noninterestbearing deposits so if you work through that math and then we think about or basis points came from our subdebt issuance and our securities growth so probably more of a 10basis point drop there could be additional drop from this quarter based on that continued mix change from noninterestbearing deposits we saw it it was a few hundred million more than we had planned we did account for some of it but i dont see anywhere near the same magnitude of drop going forward that we saw from fourth quarter to first quarter the worst of its behind us jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc were you talking about margin or were you talking about nii derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i was talking about nim margin jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah yeah i was saying nii so net interest income sort of piecing those components together should we assume that dollars of net interest income are roughly flat from here for the year derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i dont think weve timed it out that specifically jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just shifting looking at capital levels youre in the range of your goals how should we think about buybacks through the year here if youre continuing to build capital is that something that we should think about or is it just the environment is too difficult to really say for a bank to be back in buying back stock at this point derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah we continue to stick to the same priorities weve talked about in all our other calls which would be dividend organic growth and were not our guidance does not contemplate buybacks or acquisitions jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so even with the price pullback that wouldnt change your thinking on buying back stock associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp correct jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks jared operator our next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks good afternoon everyone maybe first just kind of following up on the net interest income discussion so you mentioned that assumes two rate cuts in the back of the year how would that guidance change if those cuts werent in the assumptions i know theyre late in the year but just curious what that would be if it was just the may hike derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think the easiest piece to give you is a 25basis point rate increase is about million a quarter and its symmetrical so if we dont get it we would not get compressed by million a quarter and you can use that as a guide daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just digging a little bit deeper into the office commercial real estate balances just trying to get a sense for what is kind of like metrotype of buildings in chicago or milwaukee of the office portfolio andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah why dont you take that patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah its largely suburban properties we dont have a lot of exposure in the ill say core urban markets that were in in our footprint daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 okay all right helpful and last quickly just on the loan growth expectations for the year i heard you say the tpo is obviously coming out of that is that most of the difference in the loan growth guidance or are you pulling back in other areas youre seeing lower demand andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i would say the tpo is really just a small portion of it because whats happened in the mortgage business as you may know is prepayments have slowed significantly and so were still seeing growth with significantly less production i would say that weve meaningfully tried to on the auto book were trying to make sure that were getting a nice yield on those weve not expanded into new markets at the pace that we had originally planned we see a slight decrease in the pipelines in commercial banking as we go throughout the year so when you add all those together i would say tpos a small piece of it but i would say its a general some of the decisions that weve made some of the more severe underwriting that we have strategic decisions on expansion and then some decrease in pipeline on the commercial side yearoveryear daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay terrific and thats all i had thanks for the color andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks daniel operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good afternoon everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi maybe just big picture theres a lot of talk about increased bank regulation after the events of march what could that mean for a bank like associated kind of billion and growing any thoughts there andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i think they showed their hand recently and theyre appropriately caring about the granularity of deposits i think when you look at where we are when we have of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits we feel like were in a really good position associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 when you think about liquidity coverage i think some of the major banks speak to that maybe in a just a little bit different way versus whats available in hours maybe its within days but i think liquidity coverage is going to be of course important there the one thing and i will say from a regulatory standpoint i feel like the occ and the fed from associated bank perspective quickly got in asked for a lot of details from i suspect all of their banks and appropriately so and has aggregated that so learning a lesson from a couple of bank failures is the right approach an appropriate approach what will come from that in the midterm and long term well have to wait and see what happens by segment but to date i dont feel as if weve been asked questions that are not appropriate for banking i suppose that therell be an increased focus on asset liability management with an increased focus on deposits but with regards to the overall policy change or regulatory changes its too early to know what will be formalized terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that andy and then as my followup ive noticed the last couple weeks some larger banks are getting out of the auto floor plan business can you just remind me was that an area you focused on when you joined or was it more on the auto finance side on the consumer business and if not is that an opportunity that would make sense for associated andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well review all of one thing that weve said is were going to review all of our categories and make sure we can move towards maximizing returns weve already made one of those moves in tpo thirdparty origination on mortgage which really didnt have anything to do with what occurred in the last days as much as the fact that we have more maturity across all of our lending verticals with regards the floor plan we dont have immediate plans to enter into that were not in the floor plan business today we are in the indirect auto business that was initially started if you might remember as a hedge against mortgage volatility and gosh i think weve seen a little mortgage volatility so its working as we had hoped we believe its significantly better yields than what wed seen in thirdparty so we like where that had started but if we see an opportunity in floor plan where there are good yields and good relationship value and an opportunity for deposits we would consider it but we dont have immediate plans to enter into that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to clarify on the interest rate assumptions could you restate when the two cuts you expect to occur in the back half of the year are derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp september and november brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and i hear you on the dollar impact but as i think through kind of dynamic balance sheet modeling just given higher deposit betas and worsening kind of mixes across the industry is there a possibility where maybe that second cut is actually maybe beneficial or neutral as it relates to nii and nim just given that the second cut might help a little bit more on the deposit cost derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah im not sure that would be a great its a very good question and it would be a great case study typically deposit costs keep going up for another month or two or three after the last hike so its not obvious to me that that would help but i know i ask and if you could immediately take advantage of it with deposit pricing it might but i havent seen it successfully play out that way before that being said ive seen a lot of things this quarter that i havent seen before andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think that for me brody the real question for our industry is deposit mix shift and that impacts everybody on the demand deposit side theres some view that that is a reversion to the norm that maybe that money went into there during some of the stimulus and its coming back out through spend thats logical and if that is the case we would expect that impact to decrease every quarter over the next three four five six quarters until that kind of has worked its way through the system i think that is maybe as significant of an impact to margin going forward brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just one more on the margin front i guess help me think through the although this is more on the nii front with the lower nii guide im assuming its mostly due to funding and is it a mix of worsening funding mix or youre also expecting accelerating betas derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so the guidance contemplates beta that get just about so those have crept up weve shared i think it was just below in our last one thats largely driven by mix probably the new development in is largely what andys talking about is the mix it was noninterestbearing for us those were largely stable as a percent of deposits the last four quarters and there was really much more movement than had been happening in really in the last quarter and you put that together with a little bit higher deposit betas and you end up with sort of what our guidance comes out to be which is flattish nii quarter to quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i just had a couple of last ones just on the auto book i just wanted a couple clarifications could you remind me what the i guess we had to define it by fico score or prime versus superprime or whatever like could you help me define where most of those what most of those who most of those loans would be made to from a demographic perspective as it relates to credit score andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp im going to start with the easy part then im going to turn it over to our expert pat ahern this is andy i believe about or of these loans would be considered prime or superprime and if you use our score card model we actually believe that of them are the average fico in the first quarter for example at the time we did the loan was in the first quarter so a pretty strong borrowers and thats where were staying thats the neighborhood we expect to live in because typically when you lend to them they pay you back and so maybe give a little more color around that pat patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah i mean the metrics across say the last rolling kind of 13month averages have maintained at the same levels andys talking about i think across the whole portfolio the fico is like so thats only increased this last go round but weve seen a fair amount of nice stability there and we like a lot of other lending areas we have not stretched to find volume there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it this is just the last one on this and its something that im wondering just about consumers as a whole when you underwrite those auto loans is there any i guess in the model or in the process is there any part that looks at the like the durability or the stability of that borrowers credit score like over a multiyear timeframe and i ask just because if you have a marginal bar that might be marginally prime that gets a bunch of cash given to them from the government and then they can make months of consistent payments that really helps the fico score when maybe behaviorally theyre not necessarily what the fico score that is at the end of the months indicates they would be so is there any kind of like stability to that fico score given like through time andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah let me make sure i give my perspective on how a consumer operates and the way a consumer operates is if they like to pay doesnt really matter what their income level is they pay and so typically what you see the consumer can get a little bit more healthy but somebody that is not a payer before they get stimulus doesnt all of a sudden become a really disciplined consumer that has not been my experience with regards to the durability of the score that view doesnt exist to my knowledge and so when we look at what it is we look well beyond just a fico score so when we say a balance scorecard were looking at multiple iterations and what we did brody is we bought data in this when we took over the business and brought in a team that has been in this business for decades so i dont have as big a concern on an inflated fico and in short period of time somebody going from subprime or nearprime to prime and superprime i just think thatd be a very very big stretch for that to happen and i think associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 whats important is thats not the only measurement were using when were underwriting this and that is the nature of the balance scorecard brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thats very helpful thank you patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp youre welcome andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks for joining us brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc happy to operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with you question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc question on slide with some money market the noninterestbearing decline it looks a lot like others but im just curious how much of that runoff happened after march and im specifically looking at the money market piece of that was some of that ratedriven or intentional im just kind of curious what happened kind of pre and postmarch andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i dont have the exact breakdown but ill say a couple things here we did see some uninsured deposits leave the bank and our numbers surely would have looked different on core customers had silicon valley bank had the failures not occurred so thats one thing associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 the second piece but its not crazy numbers for us and what i would say though still is there is a mix shift that is going on that was happening before silicon valley bank and to be clear its happening in our industry it is not its not unique to associated its in my opinion across the board its a consumer behavior jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay i guess maybe another way to get at this if were sitting here in days does slide look similar just perhaps not as amplified is that fair andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp it would make me sad if it looked the same because i just told you that i thought we were going to grow deposits for the year so well it looks somewhat similar let me take a pause on that maybe with the i was going to say similar with different numbers the magnitude of the loss we wouldnt think would be as significant the challenge on noninterestbearing we think at some level will stay the same so the mix could be similar but just not to such exaggerated dollars if that makes sense jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay and then how about just bigger picture more on slide loan growth drivers from here it sounds like youre saying commercials a little bit slower maybe some of its selfimposed maybe the pipelines have changed a bit but how about slide how does that look as the year progresses andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we think mortgage warehouse if you look at that and you look back and theres a table in the back that shows average deposit that just spiked at the end of the quarter we dont expect that to be a similar phenomena the rest of the year so that is not a high growth that would be surprising to me and so that something changes wildly with interest rates that that would be a primary grower for us wed expect the modest growth in mortgage although were out of the tpo unless again theres a large change in interest rates for the refinance like it booms this year which we dont anticipate we wouldnt see a large retrench there we would think that there would be steady growth in the commercial part of our business and im not so sure that that reit approach would change so thered be a little bit of them and well have steady growth in the auto finance assuming that we can continue to lend to highquality borrowers at a good yield jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one more on the expense growth guidance you talked about already taking some actions to get to that lower growth level can you give us some examples of what youre doing and then also where you feel its necessary to spend money thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah sure so one thing that ive said is that we go into each year with a plan for growth and then we would be immediately ready and willing to pull levers on the expense side if we didnt see that growth emerging so we associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 have a decent amount of growth but not to what i thought was the upper range of that one thing we did is we pulled the lever on thirdparty origination but we also recognized where our mortgage volume was overall and we decreased our staffing both contractors and fte in that category then we looked at the rest of the year and we looked at where strategic adds were being made and what were necessary in this environment and we put a process in place that requires it to go through quite a process to add any of those people including up to our cfo having to sign off on that and trust me when derek doesnt just sign when he sees it he has a discussion about that so that will slow any strategic adds that we might have had and then we look at the areas that we think are going to thrive going into the end of the year and into next year and we will continue to add quality people in those places but netnet we wont necessarily replace every role that comes in we wont add some of them that were planned weve reduced lines of business and then frankly well set up a much more thorough process in the next two to three weeks to start to look across our company heading into as to what we should look like then jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough well derek seemed like a nice guy at our conference in march but i didnt ask him to buy me anything so yeah ill try the next time andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp he is a nice guy jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp he should be at that conference jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for everything andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 hey this is andrew leischner on for chris mcgratty hows it going andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good andrew andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so looks like the quarterly provision has been a little under million in the last three quarters is that a good run rate going forward do you expect that to ramp up given the macro uncertainty and also if you can provide any insight on where you expect to see reserve levels go that would be great thanks patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp i would say well probably i could see provision increasing from here weve come off such a small level but its hard to say what thats going to be were going to continue to monitor loan growth where the markets are going from a macro level but then more importantly our individual credits in the portfolio weve just gone through a complete deep dive across the full commercial bank including ci and cre and we really did not find any significant movements in risk rating changes where there were no surprises that came out of stuff and well continue to do that on a quarterly basis that being said if we see continued pressure or probability of recession later in the year going into well monitor that and make appropriate adjustments andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp andrew i think its also important to remember that when you decrease your growth with the cecl methodology you dont have as immediate of impact on your level weve taken qualitative downturn factors and increased those in our model and then so thats already been occurring and then finally we do believe that the market will slowly have some level of deterioration at some point but we are not anticipating wild swings with the nature of our portfolio and remember were in the upper midwest and what that means is the real estate isnt quite as volatile and thats sometimes an area where you see volatility so were not immune to macroeconomic impacts but we think it would be more of a slow build as we go throughout the year andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks that was really helpful and so with your loan deposit ratio at at quarter end and i know deposit trends look positive but can you provide where youre comfortable with that loan deposit ratio going derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp well associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp you want to answer this one this one derek likes or ill take it because i like it too derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i dont want to get in your way ill clean up anything you miss andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp wow okay fair enough look were pretty comfortable staying around that area as loan demand and growth decreases our goal is to try to fund that with our deposit growth in the instances were not afraid to flex on the wholesale but we have multiple initiatives i mean when we think about the digital sales platform when we think about our mass affluent when we think now were the 13th largest hsa business in the country and we are forecasting doubledigit growth there when we think that we have more rms and if they are not lending they sure as heck should be talking about primary relationships and we have doubledigit increases in our treasury management sales so we have a lot of reasons to believe that we can outpace the market when it comes to deposit growth we just have to execute first quarter was a noisy market for our industry but we still believe that were in a position to grow our deposits we would like to stay in that range our initiatives will continue to have a focus on holistic relationship and deposits we started a new branding campaign and weve already gotten early results and i guess the other thing that gives me some optimism is that our primary customers were consumer and businesses even with the noise in the first quarter they still had positive growth they had marginal positive growth but were just getting started in many of these consumer initiatives so you asked a simple question i gave you a complicated answer because its not simple but the short answer would have been im comfortable at the range wed like to fund that with customer growth as opposed to wholesale or net worth growth but were comfortable in the shortterm because we believe in those initiatives using those levers as long as its profitable andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thank you and just one final quick one from me what is your deposit beta assumption in your guidance derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp just north of for interestbearing deposits around for total deposits andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator and our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co afternoon guys thank you for taking the question i think most of my questions have been answered but was curious on the just the slightly reduced fee guidance is that just a function of the tpo transaction or is there anything else underlying that derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no most of that has to do with service charges on consumer with our freefriendly rollout and then a little bit of ecr impact on the commercial side r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right easy enough thats actually all i have so thank you very much andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thank you i think that concludes the questions that we have look we appreciate the level of questions we know that its been a dynamic quarter for everyone in the industry we appreciate your continued interest we welcome brody for the first time and
