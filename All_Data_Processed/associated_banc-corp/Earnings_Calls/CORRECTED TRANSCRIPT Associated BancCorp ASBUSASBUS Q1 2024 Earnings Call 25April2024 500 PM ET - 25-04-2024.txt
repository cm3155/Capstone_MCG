associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well good afternoon everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined this afternoon by our chief financial officer derek meyer and our chief credit officer pat ahern ill kick things off by sharing some highlights from the quarter from there derek will provide a few updates on our margin our income statement and capital trends and pat will cover up on an update on the credit now as we entered weve had two key themes in mind first the resilience of our local markets in the face of macro uncertainty and then our continuing to drive our strategic plans by acquiring customers deepening relationships and enhancing our return profile while recent economic data has clouded the macro outlook over the remainder of the year were encouraged by the resilience weve seen in our midwestern footprint where unemployment levels in wisconsin and minnesota remain at or below the consumer remains relatively healthy despite rising prices and our commercial customers continue to explore investments in their businesses while remaining vigilant about the challenges posed by the current environment also giving us confidence is our disciplined approach to credit weve anchored ourselves in stable midwestern markets and we developed a diversified cre portfolio with limited exposure to key pressure points such as rent controlled multifamily or downtown office properties given the pressures from elevated rates we have continued to see signs of normalization in the portfolio but has been on a casebycase basis we have yet to see any meaningful negative trends concerning specific asset classes or geographies with that said our team has remained disciplined methodically reviewing our portfolios on a regular basis to ensure were rating appropriately and staying ahead of any issues that may emerge down the road all of these factors have enabled our company remain front footed on executing our strategic plan since i joined the company three years ago weve generated significant momentum we bolstered our leadership team with several key hires across the bank weve continued to add talented commercial rms throughout the footprint and we have significantly elevated the customer experience for our retail and small business customers by deploying several product upgrades and modernizing our customerfacing digital experiences these efforts are driving results across the company our customer satisfaction scores have continued to improve to historically high levels and earlier this month we were recognized by jd power who named us number one for retail banking satisfaction in the upper midwest our colleague engagement scores have also improved as we advanced our plan we were recently named a winner of the top workplaces in the usa award while also winning five energage awards for cultural excellence we believe the foundation of a successful company starts with happy customers and happy colleagues and we can see evidence that were on the right track importantly though our efforts have also translated to results that have direct impact on our bottom line here in  we saw positive household growth across the bank after several years of downward trends in organic numbers and we again delivered broadbased loan growth and core customer deposit growth for the quarter both of which enable us to remix our balance sheet and improve our return profile over time to build on this organic growth momentum were hard at work executing phase of our strategic plan originally announced in november with several key hires product launches and other initiatives already completed in the past days we remain on track with our plans we expect the full impact of these actions in phase to be realized in the second half of and into as we look forward were encouraged by the early results from our plan but we expect to make additional progress as we move throughout the year while macro question marks remain we feel wellpositioned due to our foundation discipline around credit and expenses tailwinds from growth initiatives already completed and incremental momentum from phase were on track towards providing a stronger future for our company and importantly our key stakeholder group as well associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 with that id like to walk through some of the financial highlights for the first quarter beginning on slide on a diluted gaap basis we posted earnings of per share here in  demonstrating the underlying strength of our core earnings profile in what has been a challenging operating environment for the industry we continue to remix both sides of the balance sheet by executing on initiatives that help us lower our funding costs improve our liquidity position while also improving earned earning asset yields on the funding side were focused on driving core customer deposit growth and here in  we accomplished that by adding customer deposits for the third consecutive quarter specifically core customer deposits grew by during the first quarter these results were boosted somewhat seasonally but the growth was also a reflection of the momentum weve generated through our organic growth strategy across the bank weve now added billion of core customer deposits since the midpoint of this emphasis on core customer funding sources has also enabled us to draw down on our wholesale funding by another during  during the quarter we also grew period end loans by million led by steady growth in our primesuper prime auto portfolio and emerging ci growth we continue to build high quality balances in these segments to diversify and strengthen our earning asset mix over time and were encouraged by these initial results in what is typically a seasonally slow loan growth quarter moving to the income statement improving asset yields were boosted by the full benefit of our  repositioning to drive a increase in net interest income and a basis point increase in our margin for the quarter deposit cost pressures have not yet fully subsided as of  but the pressures continue to abate as the mix shift in our back book has slowed and the competitive environment has stabilized our noninterest income of million was up million from the same period last year and while we feel confident about the stability of our noninterest income in the short term and about our ability to grow this category down the road we continue to expect non interest income to compress slightly in and while we continue to invest in people products process and technology expense discipline remains a foundational focus for our company our  noninterest expense of million included another million in fdic special assessment costs to replenish the deposit insurance fund we will continue to diligently manage our run rate expense level as we execute our growth strategy throughout the year our conservative credit culture also continues to be a foundational component of our strategy in  we did see our nonaccruals and net chargeoffs tick higher but these trends were balanced by decreases in delinquencies and total criticized loans taking a disciplined and consistent approach to reviewing loan risk rating provides a good view of the credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography we will continue to monitor asset quality closely so we can stay ahead of the curve now weve generated significant momentum as a company over the past three years and as shown on slide the benefits of these efforts are starting to come through in a number of ways since announcing our initial strategic plan back in weve added key talent in leadership positions across the bank weve grown our commercial rm base weve upgraded the customer experience implemented a successful massive loan program and amplified our brand presence throughout our footprint in each case this progress started with listening listening to our colleagues listening to our customers and by delivering what these stakeholder groups have asked for our efforts are being recognized weve used customer feedback to steadily improve the bank experience through digital upgrades product launches and service enhancements these efforts were recognized earlier this month when we were named number one for retail banking customer satisfaction in the upper midwest by jd power weve also used associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 colleague feedback to enhance collaboration and provide them with the tools they need to do their jobs better just this week we were named winner of the for top workplaces usa award and also won five culture excellence awards importantly though our efforts arent just winning awards theyre transforming our financial profile here in  we saw net growth across the board in consumer business wealth households reversing a steady trend of net decreases over the past several years as compared to the same period a year ago our consumer household acquisition was up our consumer household attrition rate was down over the same time customer growth with quality accounts will provide a tailwind financially over time were also seeing our strategy translate to net growth on both sides of the balance sheet in what has been a challenging growth environment for the industry during  we again saw broadbased loan growth and core customer deposit growth these are just a few examples of how the work that has been done across the company is setting us up to become a stronger company over time as we move to slide we want to share a few more recent examples of how were building on our momentum since announcing phase of our organic growth strategy back in november weve stayed on offense achieving several milestones in our second wave of organic ph investments in some cases these efforts are already having an impact but we expect to see the full impact ramp up over the course of the year and into now ive said before were not looking to just fill seats at associated were looking to add talent the success of any strategy hinges on having the right people in the right places and weve made significant strides in bolstering our senior leadership team with top talent from across the midwest we expect that trend to continue when we add mike lebens to our commercial team in minnesota next month mike joins us from wells fargo where we spent over years in commercial banking most recently serving as a division portfolio executive for six states including wisconsin and minnesota we also need to ensure we have the right folks on the front line to help us drive towards our goals as such were continuing to invest in training for our branch bankers to handle mass affluent relationships were continuing to add commercial and small business rms throughout the footprint and just last week we enhanced our commercial banking team by adding three senior rms in madison milwaukie and chicago there is a growing perception in the midwest that associated banc is an employer of choice and thats both internally and externally on the right side of the page weve continued to make progress with various digital product and marketing enhancements designed to support organic growth taken with the enhancements weve already made these actions bolster our efforts to attract new customers and deliver and deepen relationships as the impact of each of these initiatives ramps up over the course of the year we expect them to have an increasing impact on our financial results this gives us confidence that we are on track with our strategic plan and as such we continue to expect total loan growth of between and total core customer deposit growth of between and and total net interest income growth of between and for so with that id like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the first quarter beginning on slide as mentioned we added million of core customer deposit growth in  representing a increase from the prior quarter while these results were boosted by seasonality the growth was broad based across several subcategories reflecting stabilization of the mix shift weve experienced over the past year over the past three quarters weve now added billion in core customer deposits to our balance sheet this core growth has enabled us to steadily decrease our reliance on wholesale funding sources and we brought down our total wholesale funding by another here in  deposit flows continue to be lumpy by nature and the environment remains competitive but we remain confident in our growth prospects based on incremental boost we expect to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 receive from our initiatives over the course of the year and as such we continue to expect to drive core customer deposit growth between and for moving to slide we highlight our loan trends through the first quarter on a quarterly average basis loan balances decreased by million in  which is a direct reflection of the million mortgage loan sale that settled towards the end of december on a period end basis however loans grew by million in  as expected the overall loan growth trends were led by steady growth in our primesuper prime auto book and the commercial and industrial bucket weve continued to emphasize these areas as a way to help us remix our balance sheet over time to decrease our reliance on low yielding lower relationship asset classes and to enhance our return profile while still maintaining our solid credit standards across our broader portfolio we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns taking into account the current lending environment and the anticipated impacts of our initiatives we continue to expect to drive total loan growth of to in with that ill pass it to derek to walk through the income statement and capital churns derek derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy ill start with our asset and liability yield trends on slide while the target fed funds rate has remained stable since july of last year we continue to see asset yields inch higher through the back half of and that trend has continued into  of this year as a sizable portion of our loan book is repriced and remixed over time this trend has been led primarily by the ci cre and auto categories total earning asset yields increased by basis points over the prior quarter and landed at here in  like others in the industry weve seen our funding costs increase over the past year due to a combination of rising rates liquidity pressures and a mix shift in our customer deposit base however after seeing these pressures stabilize over the back half of the rate on total interest bearing liabilities flattened out at from the fourth quarter to the first quarter this flattening was largely driven by the paydown of fhlb that we completed as part of our balance sheet repositioning in  but its also a function of ongoing stabilization in the deposit environment and our efforts to strengthen our funding profile through organic core customer growth deposit growth moving to slide you can clearly see the impact of these recent trends on both our net interest income and our margin here in  our nii landed at million for the quarter a million increase from the prior quarter our nim increased by basis points to as we shift to slide i want to take a moment to discuss all the various elements of our strategic plan our shift in the mix on both sides of our balance sheet and driving us towards an enhanced profitability profile on the asset side of the balance sheet weve already taken several steps to diversify our loan mix in a way that enables us to decrease our reliance on lowyielding lowrelationship lending strategy while still maintaining our solid credit standards we meaningfully grown our commercial rm base over the past three years while also changing the incentive structure to emphasize holistic relationships including deposits and other services weve steadily grown a primesuper prime indirect auto portfolio to diversify our consumer lending business at higher spreads and last year we exited the lowrelationship lowyielding tpo mortgage business sold nearly billion in mortgage loans and moved to an originate to sell model during the first quarter you could see the results of these changes in our loan growth figures where we added million in auto balances to a portfolio with average yield of over added million in ci balances to a commercial business portfolio with an average yield of over and held balances flat on a mortgage book with an average yield of below associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 on the liability side weve talked extensively about our efforts to attract deepen and retain core customer relationships as a way to decrease our reliance on wholesale funding and youve seen that come to life as weve added significant core customer deposit balances for three straight quarters while taking steps to decrease our wholesale funding over the same time period so as you can see all of this has not happened by accident were taking purposeful actions that are changing the makeup of our balance sheet and the return profile of our company for the better the early results are promising but were still working to make sure we stay on track to meet our mediumterm goals based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we continue to expect net interest income growth of between to in this guidance assumes basis point fed rate cuts throughout the year beginning in june on slide we continue to manage our securities book to remain within our to target with the benefit of rising rates and our securities repositioning the average yield on our securities book has now risen by basis points from the same period a year ago after adjusting our cet1 capital ratio to include the impacts of aoci this impact would have represented a basis point hit to cet1 in  the spread of this impact grew slightly versus the prior quarter largely driven by rising interest rates as a percent of total assets our investment securities and cash position held firmly at roughly at the end of the quarter over the remainder of we will continue to target investments to total assets of between and moving to slide we highlight our noninterest income trends through  our noninterest income came in at million for the quarter which was down million relative to our adjusted  number but was up million from the same period a year ago our first quarter results were driven by a million increase in service charges and deposit account fees and a million increase in mortgage banking after posting the million gain on sale of b2b shares in  we also booked another million gain on the sale of b2b in  as of march we had no visavis shares remaining these figures were partially offset by million decrease in capital markets fees which stemmed from quarterly decreases in syndications and trading account revenues while we feel well positioned on the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged environment we continue to expect non interest income to compress by ph to as compared to our adjusted base of million moving on to slide we continue to make targeted investments to support our initiatives but maintaining a disciplined on expenses continues to be a foundational focus for the company our first quarter expenses of million were up relative to  of but were down from the gaap number we reported in the fourth quarter of after booking million for the fdic special assessment in  we booked an additional million in fdic special assessment expense in  this was partially offset by million refund in other fdic assessment costs on an adjusted basis our efficiency ratio landed at for the quarter which is the lowest weve seen since  of our noninterest expense to average assets ratio also fell back below for the quarter which demonstrates our ability to keep expenses in check while investing in our growth strategy with that in mind we continue to expect total noninterest expense growth of between and for off of our adjusted base of million these figures exclude the fdic special assessment expense in  and  we also continue to expect annual operating leverage of between negative and in shifting to slide we saw a basis point net decrease in our tce ratio during the quarter finishing at this net decrease was driven by a basis point hit from aoci due to higher longterm rates after following the associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 as a result of our balance sheet repositioning in  our cet1 rebounded in  ending the quarter at both our tce and cet1 remain well within our target ranges as of  given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm rates to remain elevated in the near term we expect tce to remain in the range of to in we also expect cet1 to remain in the range of to im sorry to for the same timeframe ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start our credit portion with an allowance update on slide we utilized the moodys february baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the higher interest rate environment the baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive gdp growth rates a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation our acll increased by million during the quarter to million with increases in the commercial cre investor and other consumer categories partially offset by decreases in cre construction and raising mortgage our allowance continues to be driven by loan growth in select areas such as auto nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our midwest footprint as such our reserves to loan ratio landed at in  a basis point decrease versus the prior quarter but a basis point increase from the same period a year ago moving to slide our portfolio has continued to hold up relatively well with limited migration through the pipeline as evidenced by our core credit quality trends at the top of the funnel our delinquencies came down meaningfully in both the to day and the 90plus day buckets during the first quarter as we look further down the line at our total criticized and classified loans the substandard accruing and nonaccrual buckets ticked higher but these increases were more than offset by million decrease in the special mention category netting the difference total criticized loans actually decreased slightly for the second straight quarter we remain encouraged with the stability of total criticized assets and the decrease in these credits showing early stress within the nonaccrual bucket we continue to see puts and takes in  consistent with our normal course of business this includes one new million credit in which recent and pending improvements may provide a path forward for a quick resolution outside of that one particular credit nonaccruals would have remained relatively stable for the quarter which we see as another sign of overall credit stability finally we booked million in net chargeoffs during the quarter and at million in provision while net chargeoffs rose from the prior quarter they in part reflect an opportunity the bank had to accelerate a credit resolution earlier than expected the overall net chargeoff rate still remains within the expectations taken together this picture gives us confidence that the increase we saw in nonaccrual loans and net charge offs during  represent a handful of credits migrating through our ratings system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters overall we remain comfortable in the normalized indiscernible activity weve seen across the bank as weve done over the past months to months our ongoing quarterly portfolio deep dives and risk rating analysis remain a focus and a key tool to stay ahead of credit concerns given the uncertain macro outlook noted associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 earlier as we look into the year we remain diligent on monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures labor cost to just name a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank wide going forward we expect any provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes to risk grades economic condition loan volumes and other indications of credit quality finally weve provided a refresh of indiscernible cre metrics on slide as a reminder our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over course of the past several years as weve built a diverse portfolio of highquality commercial loans across our portfolios and a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolios while cre continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry we feel wellpositioned given the conservative approach weve applied across the bank in building our cre portfolio weve focused on partnering with wellknown developers and build a portfolio predominantly in stable midwest markets over twothirds of our cre portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties we do not have any exposure to the rent controlled new york city real estate market office loans represent just of our total loans as a bank within that portfolio we are weighted towards class a properties in nonurban environments we continue to take a proactive approach to cre office credits with the majority of those loans maturing for the remainder of already having strategies in place whether that be refinance sale or qualifying for extension at prevailing underwriting standards while we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely with that i will now pass it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you id like to wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide first our strategy emphasizes quality relationship focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on lower yielding non relationship balances and enhances our profitability profile based on recent progress against our plan incremental momentum we expect over the remainder of the year and the current macro outlook we continue to expect total loan growth of between and in on the other side of the balance weve been pleased with the momentum weve seen from three straight quarters of core customer deposit growth this gives us confidence were on the right track with our initiatives and we expect to benefit further over the next several quarters as our phase initiatives start to have a full impact as such we continue to expect core customer deposit growth of to in on the income statement weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and rate environment our latest forecast assumes three fed rate cuts beginning in june taking these factors into account we continue to expect net interest income growth of between and in and lastly our disciplined approach to expense expenses remains a foundational focus our company with this in mind we continue to expect noninterest expense growth of to in after excluding the impact from the fdic special assessment expense in  and  with that well open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is from daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good afternoon everybody andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe first starting on the margin guidance so you reiterated the guidance from prior quarter but you removed three rate cut assumptions and now it seems more likely that we get the later two cuts than the june cut so should we think about that ranges as more toward the upper end or was there more pressure than anticipated the first quarter that we should still be thinking kind of middle and then how does the lack of june cut play into the guidance andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well ill start that and let this is andy ill let ill have derek finish that i think you should be thinking squarely in the range of what we had before i wouldnt go low and i wouldnt go high and the reason i say that is because the assuming that its higher for longer you have an impact on your funding costs whether that be cd renewals or wholesale funding however were slightly asset sensitive so we have a benefit there when i look at three rate cuts or six or one rate cut and as you get towards the second half of the year i just see it being less and less material to us i think its fairly neutral between three and one rate cuts so as we look at it today well have to see how the deposit environment progresses with pricing but were assuming that it will be a little bit more expensive but we think that still lands us squarely in the range and the forecast that we had before and then remembering on the asset side were generating assets at a little bit higher yield and we had a decent loan growth in the fourth first quarter and we continue to expect that were going to be in the range on loan growth for the rest of the year and those loans bringing a higher yield with them derek derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think we expect nim to widen by the end of the year and we expect sequentially nii to go up i think the behavior of the deposits is really the key i dont think anyones been terribly confident that thats completely settled down so i think we feel really good about the quarter we felt good about last quarter on the deposit performance i just dont think we want to get ahead of ourselves daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 okay i appreciate that the other thing is kind of a similar question but weve seen nice progress youve seen nice progress on the deposit base had pretty good growth in the noninterest bearing in the quarter maybe you could talk about where that was coming from and if you have an idea in budgeting or as you think through this of what is a new normalized range either through the cycle or when we get to kind of a more normalized time period for what the noninterest bearing would be as a percentage of the of the deposit base derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so last time i think last quarter we shared that we expected noninterestbearing deposits to floor out at about billion billion and thats still what we think this came in as expected we have a lot of seasonality the first part of the year which makes that number move around quite a bit it came in because it came in as expected we feel good about it and expect it to creep up closer to billion by the end of the year so our expectation is that it doesnt in nominal dollars doesnt decrease and our most of our focus is then growing on interest bearing deposits and trying to make sure that we optimize that so that we can keep a lid on the amount of wholesale funding we use and thats really driving the puts and takes on our margin going forward daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc understood okay well thank you for all the color ill step back andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey just kind of a followup on slide you guys had good savings and money market growth can you talk a little bit about what drove that and do you feel like thats a repeatable type trend andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah maybe ill take that one derek its when i look at what our forecast is for the year because theres seasonality thats always involved but when we look at the full year we expect the vast majority of what were going to get in deposit growth to come from consumer so you start with the fact were growing households but were growing households and getting a higher average deposit amount per household thats a really nice combination associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 secondly on mass affluent weve gotten hundreds of millions dollars in additional funds from this customer segment that segment makes up typically of the base of the consumer company consumer bank weve been doing that for a yearandahalf and were expanding the number of people that are considered mass affluent experts third our private wealth team has accelerated its growth in two ways one to have a good private wealth deposit base you have to have a good mass affluent base now those customers are starting to expand up into private wealth secondly under the leadership of our new head of private wealth president of private wealth jayne hladio the group and the referrals internally within the different segments of private wealth in some cases have doubled so we are seeing very strong growth from the private wealth side the question of can we continue if we could continue at that rate wed be forecasting growth were forecasting to and the simple reason on that is we knew the first half would be somewhat lumpy you have bonus time and then you have tax receipts the tax receipts largely happen disbursement in the second quarter so we thought wed be fairly flat in the second quarter and then we saw last year that trend of increase in the second half of the year were going to enter the second half of the year with more momentum from our foundational products services digital commercial than we had last year and a little bit less noise in the marketplace so thats why we come in at that to but do we think its sustainable that we outperform the market over an extended period of time and deposit growth yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good good so it sounds like its core in your mind andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp it is jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah thats good okay then on slide derek you said something in your comments and i think i missed it but can you talk about the rate on new auto paper that youre getting and what kind of growth expectations you have for auto derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah we still think its we havent talked a lot about the rates but generally for the last quarter and last several quarters its north of and we expect to see roughly the same nominal dollar amount of growth each quarter its been a little north of million and that will continue itll the dollar amount will slightly decrease as the portfolio grows and the runoff grows but were not we expanded into our footprint states and we dont have plans to add other markets beyond that for the year or in our guidance that was contemplated for now jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay so that but that yield should march higher over time associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah we keep marching higher and thats whats been helpful both for that book the securities book and even a little bit for the resi whether rates stay higher for longer or go up more or even drop itll continue marching higher for those three buckets the rest of the year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right and andy i wont ask about the packers needs in the draft and ill now just step back in the queue andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp im going to stop indiscernible of saying all you need is love jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes all right thanks operator our next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens inc please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody question on fee income if i back out the indiscernible gain in the first quarter is the core run rate a bit lower and i know you talked about capital markets and what happened in the first quarter do you expect that business to rebound in  through the second half of the year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp we do it was low last year first quarter also so you expect i think youve got it right actually terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then the run rate is it a bit lower or am i just looking at one quarter and the full year youre still confident in that range andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp were still confident in that range i do not expect it to be lower than that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then i was wondering if you could provide an update on the used to be specialized lending on slide i think you removed it a quarter or two ago maybe just talk about the progress there and was it asset based equipment finance and is that just folded into commercial and business lending now associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah it really is folded into commercial lending now i mean really when you get into it its the same segment serving a similar customer particularly with equipment finance those continue to be really good businesses for us i mean if we broke that out were right on the plan that we envisioned when we launch those so we thought it was just a cleaner view just to look at that as a full view of commercial but no question being able to provide equipment finance in the manufacturing belt was wise and our assetbased lending team is just strong they do this the right way and they do in a very buttoned up fashion and theyve had nice progression on the growth in that space as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc makes sense thanks for taking my questions have a nice evening andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everybody derek i was hoping that you could speak to the expected expense trajectory i know you had said previously that cost would come down in the first quarter but nevertheless this quarters core number looks quite a bit better than i would have figured so i guess therell be some reversion back upward presumably i think you discussed the million fdic refund if i heard correctly presumably that wont repeat but will the reversion back up or sort of come all at once and then expenses stabilize or is this going to build kind of steadily throughout the year derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp itll popup a little bit without the million that youre talking about and then it just slowly glides up in second and third quarter part of it as you expect to be marketing expense part of it is technology expense as we continue to roll out products and features and then its really filling out the hiring that we started last year but continue into this year as we add rms into our key markets andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i mean if you remember we had a reduction in force at the end of last year but at the same time we started the hiring so we got ahead of the hiring pretty well and were on track there but it didnt happen in one fell swoop much as the reduction in force did so that will slowly build on revenue producers as the year goes on r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 okay perfect thank you and then andy maybe just a thought or two on overall customer demand for the industry as a whole theres just not been a heck of a lot of loan demand particularly on the commercial side you all are a bit of a unique animal given the build out of the bank and the rebuild out and then the other factors i guess you just operate in healthier markets generally but i was hoping that you could maybe provide a thought or two on overall demand and investment appetite among your customers andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well theres certainly awareness of the macro environment i mean its impossible not to know that thats true but what i would say is the quality of folks that we have and the quality of people that were adding they typically have a following so we are not we dont have to stretch on credit it is simply a matter that we have more commercial bankers than we did before on the consumer side its really a function on the customer side its a function that weve built out capabilities but on the commercial loan side we expect a steady growth within the team and the quality of the folks that were hiring theyre frankly attracting more quality and so as we go along its building on itself and we expect based on what were looking at right now for the next and days because we track very closely the pipeline of conversations were having we expect that to continue and so as that happens you hire somebody they get on boarded they have to talk to a customer then they get a loan packet and then they book it and that takes time and so thats why we feel pretty bullish about as we head into fourth quarter and some of those deals start to hit and we head into the first quarter of next year and second quarter and so on so really the momentum weve had is just a quality as opposed to quantity right now were going to add on the quantity portion of this and thatll have a double effect as we head into the second half of the year we expect r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you very much andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question nicholas moutafakis q

the trucking industry within the ci book just questions given some of the oversupply within the industry there so i dont know if you have the like the actual exposure for the bank to trucking transportation or freight patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah this is pat ahern its pretty small call it million in commitments we actually just got done with as part of our deep dives that were doing on a quarterly basis we did just carve out trucking and transportation this quarter pretty happy with the results dont see a lot of emerging risk there certainly the industry has seen some migration given volume changes giving some overcapacity within the space but our clients seem to be bouncing back resizing were starting to see some of the shipping rates and spot rates kind of bottom out here and there so we feel pretty good about where were at nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great
