sir associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thank you hillary and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our yearend earnings call im andy harmening and im joined today by chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahem our chief credit officer id like to start things off by briefly reflecting on covering the highlights for the fourth quarter and giving you the most recent and giving you the most recent update on the strategic initiatives we rolled out in september from there chris will walk you through an update on interest income fees and expenses and pat will run us out with an update on credit in many ways was an inflection point for associated banc we enjoyed consistent deposit growth improving credit dynamics and stabilization in our loan book and importantly we began to accelerate growth in several core and new lending categories more recently we continue to see signs of a strengthening economy in the fourth quarter unemployment rates in wisconsin and minnesota came down below the manufacturing expansion we saw emerge in  has maintained strong momentum which is being reflected in increasing commercial pipelines and in utilization rates customers remain resilient credit continues to improve and we feel wellpositioned to build on our momentum in now let me touch on our fourth quarter highlights as outlined in slide this quarter is marked by a significant expansion in our balance sheet notably we saw meaningful loan growth as commercial loan outstandings line utilization and our new initiatives all kicked into gear we saw million in loan growth for  which equates to annualized growth in in terms of loans even as we intentionally shrank our ppp and our oil and gas portfolios each by more than half on the liability side core low cost deposits continue to grow and as promised we began building our investment securities book to put our excess liquidity to work taken together these factors contributed to expanding margins growing net interest income and total higher revenues for the quarter turning to credit our customers continued to prove their resiliency as markets recovered throughout the year after posting reserve releases in each of the first three quarters of we posted another negative provision in the fourth quarter and a further net reserve release our cecl reserves remain appropriate for our risk profile but as we grow into next year we expect to add to our provision in accordance with our loan growth from an operating expense perspective discipline continues to be our foundational focus for associated our full year noninterest expense was down yearoveryear while our fourth quarter expense ticked up by only despite the rollout of several new initiatives and an increase in our minimum wage during the fourth quarter we also repurchased million of common stock taken together all of these factors helped us drive fullyear eps to and position us well going into now lets shift to slide id like to provide a little more detail on the trends we saw in our loan book in the fourth quarter in mid2021 we started to see some encouraging signals of increased commercial activity in line utilization and this is now beginning to translate into meaningful growth in our commercial balances in  our total commercial book and that is commercial and business lending and commercial real estate combined grew by nearly million which is more than a annualized growth rate from the third quarter while several of our specialty businesses added balances during the quarter importantly general commercial loans were the driving force behind this growth additionally were still in the early stages of our new commercial initiatives but our expanded assetbased lending team has already started to bear fruit and our equipment finance team is not far behind associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 on the consumer side the new auto finance initiative we launched on september is off to a very strong start adding nearly million of high quality auto loans to our books we have now booked over loans and as mortgage activities moderate these new auto loans will allow us to further diversify our portfolio while earning slightly better spreads following up on a strong  we also saw credit card balances increase by another quarteroverquarter which continue to suggest that confidence is growing among our retail customer base and during the quarter we took advantage of a positive economic background to export the majority of our remaining oil and gas book at minimum cost our ppp balances also continue to pay down as expected throughout the quarter and at year end our oil and gas outstandings were just million and our remaining ppp portfolio was down to million and in january we realized an additional oil and gas payoff that will bring our remaining oil and gas portfolio to approximately million with these runoff portfolios worked down we are squarely focused on driving growth in our general commercial and initiative portfolios in turning to slide we highlight our annual loan trends for and as you can see total end of period loan balances are down slightly yearoveryear but that was largely driven by intentional reductions in our oil and gas exposures runoff of ppp and some declining mortgage balances these reductions were largely offset by strong growth in general commercial and other commercial specialty verticals giving us a very strong base to build on in on slide weve highlighted a couple of additional metrics that give us optimism as we turn the page going into in  growth in commercial balances was once again supported by a steady monthly uptick in line utilization commercial line utilization numbers continue to close the gap relative to our historic levels in april of we hit a low point in utilization with regional commercial customers funding percentage points below our historic line utilization from that point the monthly gap has continued to narrow and in december the gap closed to percentage points line utilization increases during  drove about million of the commercial loan balance growth additionally our commercial real estate team has steadily grown construction lending exposures on a quarterly basis and in the fourth quarter exposures grew from  given seasonality and our substantial back book we remain confident outstandings will continue to grow well into especially once the ground thaws in the upper midwest footprint as we look to we remain bullish around loan growth specifically we now expect full year auto finance loan growth of over billion and total commercial loan growth of million to billion turning to slide let me give you an update on our initiatives when we talked back in the fall we laid out a multiyear balanced target for our new initiatives and while were still in the initial phases of the plan im very pleased with the progress so far ive already talked about total commercial and the reasons im excited about the broader segment but we thought its important to show a breakout of assetbased lending and equipment finance so you can more clearly see progress in those verticals going forward what you see here so far through yearend is mostly abl balances and while we have some abl loans on the books historically the team has already made meaningful progress quarteroverquarter now that equipment finance is up and running in  im confident both teams are working towards the targets weve set as we move through associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 on the auto side the team is off to a very strong start but weve been very thoughtful about steadily ramping up the program over time to ensure effective execution production is now eclipsing million per business day and we expect this portfolio to grow more quickly as we roll out the program to our broader dealer network and into our core footprint states over the course of turning to slide weve highlighted some of the additional steps weve taken to make headway against the four pillars of our strategic plan in the auto finance businesses weve stuck largely to prime and super prime space with average ficos north of and average ltvs on the loans we booked in the fourth quarter additionally weve officially began closing new abl deals in november of and are currently building an active equipment finance pipeline while rounding out our full lending team as we look to augment the growth in our core businesses weve continued to ramp up our staff in our commercial and small business segments and we also established a new commercial real estate office in houston allowing controlled expansion in the great state of texas on the digital front were on track to pilot our consumer digital bank platform in the second quarter of the year bringing increased flexibility and architecture that will more easily allow us to integrate fintech partners to improve the user experience and as always we continue to seek ways to efficiently deploy our capital while we see plenty of balance sheet growth in our outlooks should that not materialize we also have million in remaining repurchase flexibility available to optimize our capital position in summary our initiatives are in full swing and we look forward to building on this momentum as we head into let me pause there and hand over to chris niles our chief financial officer to provide a little more detail on our revenue and income statement trends for the quarter chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy turning to slide our net interest income increased million from the prior quarter or nearly driven by higher net interest income across most major segments and lower funding and time deposit costs our quarterly net interest margin continue to move higher after having bottomed out in  we continue to see a steady decline in liability costs and expect asset yields to continue to move higher as we move through our nearly billion of commercial and commercial real estate portfolios have historically been primarily floating rate libor and primebased portfolios over of those commercial loans will mature reprice or reset within the next year relative to our midcap banking peers we have a higher percentage of nearterm repricing earning assets and more capacity to grow our investment portfolio so we believe were at the upper end of the asset sensitivity range as we look into we have already seen our margin stabilize and begin to move higher and every major lending category is poised to benefit from our rising rate outlook this puts associated in a solid position to capitalize on the expecting rise in rate environment in given our expectations for at least two rate increases we expect our full year gaap reported net interest income to exceed million turning to slide given the high levels of liquidity in the industry we selectively added securities throughout  during the quarter our average investment security balances grew by over million and our blended portfolio yields rebounded to we anticipate deploying additional cash balances into the investment securities portfolio throughout reinvestment yields today are expected to be or better and will generally be associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 accretive to our portfolio earnings we expect to rebuild the investment portfolio to between and of total assets by yearend moving to slide we continue to see record average deposit levels average deposits were up nearly billion in  or yearoveryear notably growth continues to be concentrated in our lowest cost deposit categories our aggregated wholesale funding levels have also continued to steadily decrease over the past five quarters and have decreased by nearly million yearoveryear we expect these deposit and funding trends to continue and our margin to continue to benefit into on slide we note associated has shifted its lower cost deposit a shift to lower cost deposits have been even more pronounced when viewed on an annual basis in our average low cost deposits represented less than half of our total deposit base while at yearend they accounted for of our yearend deposit levels switching to noninterest income trends on slide we note that noninterest income was essentially flat during the fourth quarter as strong wealth and capital markets fees offset softening mortgage banking results we also saw modest growth in service charges card based and other feerelated income items taken together we view these collective trends as encouraging indicators of growing customer confidence as we continue to emerge from the pandemic looking to we expect full year noninterest income to exceed million for the year on slide we highlight our expenses the fourth quarter came in at million a million increase from the prior quarter including million of facilitiesrelated exit costs our fourth quarter expenses included initiative related expenses and our recent announced increase to minimum wage to an hour for the full year total noninterest expense of million was within our guided full year range and down million from the prior year ill remind you that we executed on expense initiatives in the second half of this year that are expected to shave about million per year off of our run rate as we continue to roll out our strategic initiatives we remain committed to maintaining expense discipline taking all of our initiatives into consideration we expect full year noninterest expense of between million and million on slide we have provided a walkforward of our quarterly pretax preprovision income from the third quarter to the fourth quarter while our pretax income was down from the prior quarter our pretax preprovision results were relatively flat quarteroverquarter and remained well above the million baseline we set for you in the second quarter as shown on slide our tangible capital tangible book value per share continues to grow and our quarter overquarter has increased to while we have taken several steps to deploy capital in an effort to support stronger growth and shareholder returns associateds regulatory capital levels also remain strong we will continue to target tce levels at or above and cet1 levels at or above with that let me hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks chris id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide we utilized the moodys december baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions moodys baseline forecast associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 assumes additional fiscal support a continuing low interest rate environment the recent acceleration in consumer prices to be transitory and relatively localized covid cases following net reserve releases of million million and million in the first three quarters of respectively we ended the year by posting a further net reserve release of million in the fourth quarter this net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for several of our specialty commercial and cre business units specifically an million reduction in oil and gas and another million reduction in cre as of december our total acll was million down from million in the prior quarter in addition our ratio of reserves to loans declined to from during the quarter we had previously guided that we expect acll to loans to drop back down to cecl day levels by the end of and we ended the year comfortably below that benchmark turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide most of our key credit metrics continued to improve over the course of the quarter our key covid commercial exposures continued to decline for the quarter led by further declines in retail and shopping center exposures nonaccrual loans also decreased by in  and were down yearoveryear while aggregated restructured loans and delinquencies have fluctuated throughout the year im pleased to announce they decreased yearoveryear net chargeoffs also decreased by million quarteroverquarter and by million versus  of going forward we expect to adjust provisions to reflect changes in risk rates economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now pass it back to andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to carry our momentum into andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat on slide we recap our full year guidance for as we look to capitalize on the economic outlook in we are expecting strong loan growth at associated with full year auto finance loan growth of over billion total commercial loan growth of million to billion and then reflecting our growth outlook and anticipation of a rising rate environment we expect total interest income to exceed million and total noninterest income of millionplus for a grand total north of billion we expect to finish with approximately million to million of noninterest expense with that and before moving to qa id like to say a few words about the cfo transition we also announced this afternoon after nearly years with associated banc our cfo chris niles will retire from the bank later this year weve engaged diversified search group and the search for successor is underway chris will continue in his current position until his successors in place to ensure a seamless and successful transition chris on behalf of the whole associated banc team i want to thank you for your many contributions over the years first serving as our treasurer then serving as the cfo and on a personal note i want to say i appreciate you helping me get my footings at associated banc your partnership and generosity of spirit has allowed me to get acclimated internally and externally i also want to emphasize that i believe we are making the cfo transition from a position of strength especially given our positive momentum at yearend our midwest markets are robust and our performance

transformation i am confident in our strategy and im confident in our team to continue to deliver strong performance for our stakeholders in the years to come ill now pass it over to chris for a few words christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you andy for those kind words it has been my privilege to work alongside an exceptional team over the last decade i could not be prouder of our collective accomplishments as i indicated to andy and the board ive been thinking about the next phase of my life for a while in consultation with andy we agreed is a good time to initiate the succession process retiring from associate will allow me to attend to personal and family interests and im deeply grateful for that opportunity with that lets open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from scott siefers of piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co afternoon guys thanks for taking the question so i guess before i get into it chris enjoyed working with you over the years ph and to do so more this year and wish you the best so christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co first yeah you bet so thank you for all your help maybe first question for you chris just ph im sorry how you see the margin trajecting from this quarters kind of where do you stand with respect to the aspirational margin in terms of progress this year seems like you should get a bunch of help from rates so maybe just some thoughts there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so when we look back on the year clearly our margin results for the year were weighed down by the excess liquidity levels that we carried over the course of the year we estimate that probably cost us about basis points in margin for the year so absent the excess liquidity our start point probably is somewhere north of and were continuing to build into positive yield accretive asset classes as we move through the course of the year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so id like to think that were going to quickly move towards and build from there i dont expect well get to this year we didnt say we would either but were going to make solid progress in moving ph that way in that direction r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then so a lot of moving parts with the change in the balance sheet mix as well as just the higher rates so i guess just as a followup want to confirm you suggested that two rate hikes are sort of embedded in the nii guide for the year and then you have sort of an easy rule of thumb that youre using for how much nii help you get for each basis points rate hike kind of in isolation christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp million per month for a 25basis point hike r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect that is a good one all right thank you very much operator our next question is from chris mcgratty of kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks and chris well miss you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in terms of the outlook was hoping you could refine or give a little more color on slide the 800plus million the 300plus million obviously its i bet intentionally openended but wonder if you could provide a little bit more clarity on what would drive those meaningfully above and how meaningfully above the billion do you expect andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well maybe i could start that off and turn it over to chris this is andy so chris what i would say is we were days into the new year and we had a strong end to the end of the year which put us in a really good position so seeing that where our pipelines are what weve closed where we started the year we think were very much on track to what our midterm shortterm targets are so yes we did leave it meaningfully openended but what i will say is every initiative that we have is on target not just from hiring people but from pipeline and not just from pipeline but from the loans that are booking although associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 thats the new rms that we have in place we havent hired enough rms at this point already to hit our commercial baseline inmarket targets we are very much on target in abl and our expectation was our first loans in equipment finance would book in the first quarter so we feel very bullish about what our forecast is but days into the year we didnt want to forecast the month by month flow of how we end up chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah understood thanks totally i get it in terms of the auto book im interested i know you talked about the prime and superprime can you just provide some color on where yields are coming on today and then also youre expecting a lot of growth and you talked about providing for that at some degree this year maybe throwing a little bit more color on that would be great christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so as andy mentioned were booking more than million per business day and thats why we have very high confidence that were going to get well above the sort of billion full year growth level because were continuing to add more dealers and well continue to add more markets as we go through the year so the baseline is there to support the growth and we think were going to add to it second i would note that the yields have come in essentially where we thought they would was at premium to what weve seen in the mortgage market and higher than mortgage yields which is what weve been targeting in that net net of the dealer discounts etcetera and so when you see the numbers well be breaking those out in future quarters i suspect youll see something that will be in a handle with a varying range as we move through the course of the year and as rates perhaps evolve with that policy andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill say chris on top of that as weve opened up the number of active dealers we purposely controlled the number of active dealers we have so were at about active dealers and weve increased that roughly every days as weve increased the number of dealers each month weve seen increased production each month we want to make sure that were sound on the operational side i want to make sure were sticking to the credit box very strictly and we have been in fact right on target so im pleased with what weve done so far but we want to make sure we do this the right way while were at active dealers today we think we could end the year with a number well exceeding double that number so and those the dealers have been very accepting based on the longterm relationships we had hoped for and we had hoped that they would send us strong deals in prime and superprime and thats exactly whats occurred so far christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 great and then just a tickytack one chris when in the year are you assuming the hikes and is there any nonrecurring in that expense guide thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp ill happily take your forecast i read on the fed im pretty sure its probably better than ours christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc but you said at least two i think in your prepared remarks are they midyear and end of year im just trying to get a sense of whats in the guide christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp one in the first half one in the second and if theres more than that theres upside christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay operator our next question is from michael young of truist please proceed with your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question wanted to start just on the mortgage portfolio obviously thats been an area thats been kind of shrinking but as rates rise we would expect maybe payments in that area and refinances out of that book might slow so should we expect those volumes to become a little more stable or any other thoughts are you doing anything proactively ahead of higher rates to kind of move some of that off the books andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp michael this is andy thats exactly what were expecting is stability in that book not only stability in the mortgage book but we actually think a longterm trend on home equity is shifting right now as well in fact we see that so we think for the first time in a long time home equity has a real chance to grow so were proactively addressing that in the first quarter of the year clearly with the rates people locked into the first mortgage at very low rates are not going to want to refinance that mortgage which opens up the home equity market as rates go up we will start to see a decrease in the churn of that portfolio so when we looked at the year our forecast was that the mortgage portfolio was going to be fairly flat and auto would make up for that at a slightly higher margin that has proven early on to be the case michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and on the auto book im just curious given your history or how you guys are kind of attacking this do you expect that rates as they rise in the market that the auto book will keep pace in terms of the yield or do you think at some point that may be a less attractive area to deploy capital versus commercial or other areas associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i see the auto as one piece of a balanced approach and so when i look at the margin being well above we have room to come down and still hit the forecast that weve put out there we are going to stick with prime and superprime period that is our focus and has been now when i think of the balance of growth i think of the equipment finance and the abl and you can see we put pretty modest targets out there we booked about million i believe in abl new abl on the fourth quarter thats two months worth of work and we forecasted million and combined at the end of the year between abl and equipment finance so we think those businesses are ones that will continue to grow for us they make sense were in a manufacturing belt the abl is extension of our commercial and were expanding our commercial teams so i expect that as we look at million to billion in commercial growth this year that will continue to be a strategy for us to continue expand on the protocols that we have and feed those and i think the margin im optimistic that we have room to even go down in that margin on prime and super prime and still hit the forecasts that we have laid out michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and one last one for me just on expenses just as i kind of think about mortgage and volumes kind of coming down at a macro level are you guys kind of shrinking the expense base there assuming that were going to be in a lower origination environment for longer or are you pivoting personnel into auto or just how are you kind of thinking about that expense run rate christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure i think were positioning ourselves to continue to service our customers and our markets through our mortgage teams across the marketplace in an effective manner recognizing that there may be more sorry less volume to manage as we move through there will still be plenty of customers to service plenty of loans to make sure that were doing the right thing on so i dont think its going to be a significant shift in our strategy but we certainly recognize maybe less new origination volumes and fewer commissions paid as we move forward andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i think the other thing is we built flexibility in our expense base by having outsourced colleagues as well as ftes so well monitor that closely based on volumes and the contractual nature of what we have out there but weve builtin the assumptions that as that goes down the expenses of that book go down as well theyre not necessarily transferrable resources into auto as thats a specialty vertical michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay fair enough and chris id be remiss if i didnt wish you congratulations and i hope you at least get to spend a few weeks somewhere warm here nearterm associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp he means warmer than green bay chris michael young q analyst truist securities inc yeah christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp okay operator our next question is from terry mcevoy of stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon terry andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and chris ill echo what others have said this afternoon congrats and i cant believe its been years enjoyed working with you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you thank you very much terry its been a pleasure terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just a couple questions in your november investor deck you talked about revenue growth of to and expense growth of to i didnt see it in todays presentation i just want to confirm that those are still good growth rates and similar in terms of how youre thinking about next year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah were not changing our longterm outlook we think the numbers that were putting forward here are consistent with that outlook and i think youll find that were making steady progress retaining those longterm goals and we feel good about those longterm goals terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right others have covered the auto and margin so the other one was anything to report on the increase in potential problem loans it just kind of caught my eye up i believe about quarteroverquarter in the commercial portfolio anything to talk about there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no not really i think we had as you know in the portfolio it ebbs and flows quarter to quarter i dont think were seeing anything systemic there thats affecting the portfolios at large terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just one last question just want to make sure have all the hires been made and relationship with dealers established to hit those loan growth targets for the year christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp the hiring for the auto team is largely in place yes thats not a significant gap and we have established dealer relationships with about today as andy mentioned well likely more than double that as we move through the course of this year so theres more to come and we havent yet opened up our footprint states minnesota wisconsin illinois in particular which we think will be a nice source of additional growth later in the year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and what id say on the verticals we have about to of the colleagues that well hire by yearend already hired and in place so but what we have there today were on track to hit our targets on the commercial side we have roughly half of the colleagues already in place and with that were on track to hit our targets the colleagues that we bring on the rest of the year in commercial well start funding our end of year beginning of next year target numbers as well so we are right on pace feel very comfortable on the hiring front and what those hires mean from a production standpoint terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc all right thanks everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from daniel tamayo of raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey daniel christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp hi daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just one for me here as we think about youve been asked about the revenue guide as a whole as we think about it just related to fee income the 300plus million number kind of putting aside whatever assumptions that are made for the mortgage banking business is there anything within the remainder of remaining line items that you would expect not to grow in or are you seeing growth in those numbers and then we can kind of put what whatever assumption we have on the mortgage banking business christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think broadly speaking were seeing positive trends in the service charges card businesses capital markets et cetera we dont make a practice of projecting a lot of indiscernible increase and were not necessarily in the business of taking asset gains and losses per se so those are the sort of the wild cards but generally speaking our fee our core feebased revenue streams all have a nice yearend trajectory and continue to build nicely andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and just the wealth business is probably another one that wasnt necessarily mentioned there we had record production we have a dedicated leader in that business for the first time in quite some time and thats really brought the group together im pleased with the results both on the sales and the retention that the portfolio performance daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc great everything else has been asked and answered and ill just also ill give you my wishes for a happy retirement and congratulations on a great career chris associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you daniel operator our next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon this is timur braziler filling in for jared maybe just starting on the improved line utilization and just the loan growth in general maybe talk through paydown activity kind of how that trended through the quarter and im wondering if you get a sense that any of the loan activity was pulled forward from the first quarter of or is this type of momentum kind of sustainable as we are now days into the new quarter christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp well i think if you look at the growth which was almost billion for the quarter were not calling for that to be sustained for quarters going forward we had really strong growth and we dont think that it was necessarily pulled forward i think it was really our customers stepping in to the market in a very positive way payoffs were not necessarily out of line with what weve seen in prior periods but new fundings and draws were the difference maker this quarter and they were increases so thats what we saw both new customers new lines from existing customers or new additions and line utilization all contribute to those numbers andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and line utilization has been a steady number for us weve seen it go up slightly for several months in a row the auto business i think is a very clear line thats increased each of the last three months and we expect that to continue to do so the commercial side as chris said look were looking for million to billion in growth for the year so it was a very strong quarter that puts us in good shape but when we think about the cre book and the numbers that we see out there on the construction side that really bodes well for that business as we head into the year the commercial pipelines that we had and keep in mind we havent yet booked our first equipment finance loan so well have equipment finance well have assetbased learning we have nice growth and the opportunity in cre so well i dont expect to forecast for the quarter and were not forecasting that im pretty bullish on what we are seeing in the fourth quarter and what that could mean for timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thank you and then just one last one for me if i can follow up on some of the auto related questions i guess the new growth is it coming from the additions of the new dealers coming online every days is it coming from the existing dealers and maybe talk about some concentration limits that youre going to be putting in place once the dealer network is kind of fully built out concentration limits on dealer activity christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 yeah so clearly the team we hired came over with a very well established collection of longstanding deep rooted relationships and as part of our acquisition of intellectual property from keybanc we acquired dealer scorecards and histories as part of this so i think we have a very good handle on the folks were doing business with we have a very good handle on the type of volume the consistency of that flow of activity and we feel very comfortable with what weve been doing here over the last roughly days and its coming along at essentially exactly what our team said it would be so were actually very pleased with that and i dont see us running into any constraints or limits for a while as we expect this to become a multibillion dollar portfolio on our balance sheet over time andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill also follow that up by reiterating the balanced nature of what our plan is and how much i think we have some legs on small business we havent talked much about that were looking at million increase in production yearoveryear just in small business our commercial businesses as weve hired people weve gotten the production fairly quickly and we have an opportunity in market to grow those the verticals that we have we believe have legs for years to come so there will be a point where that growth clearly dissipates in auto in year i dont know three four but as were moving towards that time we have a path outlined and weve taken the actions towards the beginning of both verticals commercial and small business growth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions and good luck and congratulations chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks a lot congrats chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc did you think you were this popular by the way associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp if i give my usual answer i would say of course i do jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc question for chris or pat just how do you want us to think about the provision you still have pretty healthy reserves but you did say youre below day one cecl and you obviously have a lot of growth on the horizon are we at the end of the reserve releasing in negative provisions or how should we think through them patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp this is pat i would say from a reserve ratio we might see that come down a little bit could it be in the million to million range possibly but i think were starting to see this quarter with growth some needed to add to that provision so i think as we get into the year the growth that weve outlined here will kind of push that provision in more of a build standpoint than a release jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thank you for that chris the million per month reached basis points thats great thats a great way for us to think through it how long does that relationship hold meaning how do you think about deposit betas and how comfortable are you with the rate sensitivity in the deposit base christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so i think weve been very thoughtful about the sensitivity that we experienced in deposits in the last run up and our estimate reflects that into the number that i gave you the million per month for basis points clearly its our expectation that liquidity levels are elevated and that theres going to be a shift somewhat downward i think if you asked us a year ago we would have thought that would be a more rapid shift than were actually seeing and the reality is as i think john you and i have talked about in the past the alternatives that used to be out there for investors whether thats that the commercial paper market the assetbacked cp conduits money market alternative funds the primary funds money market reform really did away with a lot of that and so theres fewer alternatives and were seeing that reflected in the biggest banks pricing and so i think theres an opportunity here where youll see as we have seen in the past a fair amount of deposit lag but well see some outflows and so were assuming those outflows and were assuming some deposit lag and thats baked into that million per month jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay fair enough and then last question maybe for you andy youve touched on the footprint being strong and kind of look im looking at slide and slide in terms of the commercial loan growth and some of the expectations there how much of that do you think is just from the footprint versus some of the specialty lines of business andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 i would say that were getting a lot of single name credits and were seeing it balanced out between wisconsin specifically probably milwaukee chicago and minneapolis so i dont have the exact mix in front of me but i will tell you that the occurrence of single name we can follow up on that but the occurrence of single name credits has been significant for us particularly as weve added rms in market christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i would throw out that we do some geographic reporting and our largest growth in commercial real estate was absolutely in our wisconsin market and its a nice turn and we saw growth wisconsin minnesota michigan illinois those are sort of the top four out of five states in the commercial end so its happening today in our core markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats what i was getting after thank you very much appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thank you so andy for you one of the questions that ive gotten more recently since the forward curve has really changed quite a bit since back when you guys put out the strategic plan is do you still feel the same need to grow the newer verticals at the same rates you discussed last year or does the likely help from rate would that allow you to sort of ease off the gas or be more measured i think i know the answer from sort of the tone of a lot of your prepared comments and responses to questions but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i think the good news is we started measured so when you have numbers that you feel are very attainable you dont have to change your strategy we dont have to reach for credit to hit million in abl i think we exhibited that with million in the fourth quarter equipment finance in a heavy manufacturing hub people are asking for these kind of loans so i feel very comfortable with the numbers that doesnt change our strategy and our approach were going to stay true to the credit side were going to stay true to the prime and super prime and auto were going to make sure that we have the fundamentals down behind it i see the rate increase as more of a tailwind for us r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect perfect and then just maybe returning to loan growth for a second so its pretty clear whats going on with auto and commercial but i was curious chris you might have a sense for what full kind of allin loan growth associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 would look like in after you kind of take into account all the moving parts be it the combination of the ci momentum auto finance but also ppp runoffs thatll hit averages and some of the other areas that are kind of getting deemphasized to make room for auto christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i mean the reality is our runoff portfolios now are down to given the payout that we had here in the first here in january down to less than million so thats the runoff book is million and shrinking and were looking to stabilize the mortgage book so the really only moving parts that we havent given you is home equity and id like to think that in a rising rate environment home equity will probably stabilize so if those are stable then really the growth is all coming from the initiatives that weve outlined and talked through r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay wonderful thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you operator we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session i will now turn the call back over to andy harmening for closing remarks andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i want to thank you all for your interest in associated banc and i would be remiss if i didnt end with i hope you guys are all going to have a great weekend and support our packers thank you so much operator this concludes todays conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you
