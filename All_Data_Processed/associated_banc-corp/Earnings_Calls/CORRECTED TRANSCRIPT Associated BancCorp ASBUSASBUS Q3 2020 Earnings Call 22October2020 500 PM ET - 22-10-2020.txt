banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 philip b flynn president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call joining me today are chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer those love saying that this has been a challenging and unusual year we pivoted in march in response to the pandemic and have been retooling our delivery channels since to best meet our customers needs we deployed ourselves to seamlessly interact through virtual channels and ive seen an accelerating shift to mobile and online banking with a likely very low interest rate environment facing us for an extended period it became critical to respond in areas we can control lets start with the actions we took during the third quarter on slide we have detailed our optimization efforts and the restructuring of our securities and real estate lending subsidiaries during the third quarter we announced the sale and planned consolidation of of our branches we also announced the strategic streamlining of several corporate managerial and back office functions as a result of these actions we incurred million of pretax charges in  but we expect these changes to drive a million per year reduction in our run rate expenses as we move into this quarter and we also deployed about half of our excess liquidity position to repay million of fhlb advances this prepayment resulted in a million  pretax expense however we expect this to improve annualized net interest income by million beginning in  continuing through with diminishing but continuing savings through and into finally we were able to unlock capital losses through the restructuring of our securities and real estate lending subsidiaries and this resulted in a million after tax benefit during the quarter turning to slide weve highlighted the impact of our  initiatives on our pretax preprovision income adjusting for the million of restructuring and prepayment costs third quarter ptpp would have been million on slide weve provided a walk forward of eps which breaks down the various initiatives executed during the quarter youll notice when tax affected the onetime costs of our efficiency initiatives were more than covered by the tax benefits we realized from the reorganization of our subsidiaries if you were to exclude both the restructuring charges and the tax benefits from our eps for the third quarter the adjusted result is within of our reported gaap eps of so in effect the items largely offset each other the actions this quarter were net additive to our tangible book value turning to slide average loan balance trends are shown total average loans came in at billion down slightly from the prior quarters average commercial real estate grew million driven by the continuing funding of construction loans and at september we still had billion of unfunded commercial real estate commitments commercial and business lending on the other hand declined by million on average as our general commercial customers largely use their increased excess liquidity balances to paydown open lines of credit turning to slide we highlight changes in the end of period loan balances period end loans were up million or for the quarter driven again by strong growth in commercial real estate lending which was up million mortgage activity remains strong which was reflected in our elevated mortgage warehouse lending balances at quarter end power and utilities lending along with commercial real estate construction and industrial loans have continued to grow throughout associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 ill also call out oil and gas which declined nearly a million during  and now represents only of our total loan portfolio consumer lending balances came down during the quarter driven by refinancing activity and our decision to sell million of prepayments susceptible mortgages now let me provide an update on our deferral programs on slide you can see our commercial deferrals have continued to steadily decline as of october we have approximately million of active commercial loan deferrals down from june our commercial deferrals have largely rolled off their initial 90day terms and the remaining deferrals are primarily related to covidimpacted portfolios commercial real estate loan deferrals were million of that million and are primarily related to hotel and retail borrowers commercial and business lending deferrals have declined to just million at october and they now comprise less than of the commercial and business loan book taken together the million of active commercial and commercial real estate deferrals at october make up about of our total commercial loans outstanding our consumer related covid relief efforts are highlighted on slide in the beginning of the pandemic we granted deferrals to virtually any customers who ask for assistance the deferrals granted were for six months so the bulk of those deferrals began to expire during september at october we had million of active deferrals down from june these loans now represent approximately of outstanding consumer loan balances its important to note however that of the remaining million of active deferrals million of that is still on their first deferral period the bulk of those deferrals will expire during the balance of october and we expect most will not require additional assistance so of those loans that have come off deferral in the consumer book at this point only million have asked for additional assistance among consumers whose deferrals have ended are current or less than days past due the trends were seeing is deferrals roll off continue to be positive and we feel confident many of these borrowers will go back to their precovid performance on slide weve provided an allowance update we utilized the moodys september baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus continuing low rates ph and a covid vaccine that becomes widely available in  of for  of our net allowance build was only million down from million in the prior quarter ill direct you to the top right chart where we illustrate the acll trend during you can see our net reserve build has tapered off throughout the year this reflects the overall stability of our loan portfolio and our real time outlook for all our credit exposures at quarter end as you can see from the lower table on this page during  we actually released reserves in four lending categories and added reserves in three the largest net build was in our commercial real estate investor portfolio where we added to our reserves related to shopping malls and other retailer exposures reserves on our oil and gas portfolio declined million as we continued to manage that portfolio down as of september our total allowance was million and covered of total loans credit metrics are presented on slide as a reminder these metrics reflect our real time risk rating and credit evaluations with the expectation that substantially all the active deferral activity will come to some conclusion or remediation this quarter potential problem loans decreased million primarily driven by the migration of covid affected loans to nonaccrual overall nonaccrual loans increased million driven primarily by the migration of two commercial real estate malloriented reits and our only sand fracking company into non associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 accrual loans included in our key covid commercial exposures made up of nonaccrual loans at the end of  this inflow was partially offset by nonaccrual oil and gas loans which declined million due to charge offs note sales and payoffs chargeoffs for the quarter were million outside of oil and gas and net charge offs were again less than million for the quarter reserves on the remaining oil and gas book remain over turning to slide average deposits were billion up nearly million or over the second quarter average deposit growth again came from low cost savings and checking accounts this quarter liquidity remains high and our deposit mix continues to improve low cost deposits accounted for nearly of our balances at the end of the third quarter turning to slide third quarter net interest income was million with a net interest margin of we previously guided that net interest margin would bottom out during  and begin to pick up in  and as we expected margin hit bottom in july and august and then rebounded up to in september asset yields stabilized during the third quarter while our liability costs trended downward we continue to expect to see margin expansion further into  and into we expect spreads to widen on our libor based commercial loans as we continue to implement new libor floors into our new and renewing loans this will happen over time or in conjunction with other repricing or credit actions including the anticipated migration to sofr and other indices later in on the liability side our time deposit levels have both been declining and repricing lower when cds renew or roll over today theyre generally repricing from approximately to below basis points we expect this repricing to provide margin lift going into additionally well see a full quarter impact during  from the prepayment of our fhlb advances and we expect this will provide a million benefit to net interest margin in the fourth quarter and about a million improvement in turning to slide second quarter noninterest income came in at million noninterest income was lower in  than  however this was driven by the large gain from the sale of associated benefits and risk consulting in  and of course the lack of revenue from abrc going forward service charges and deposit account fees came in at million an increase of nearly million quarteroverquarter card based fees increased from the second quarter up to million so the combination of covid relief winding down as well as more normalized economic activity is driving these fee lines our mortgage banking activity remains strong this quarter with nearly million of mortgages sold to the agencies generating million in net fee revenue after million of msr impairment in the first half of the year impairment for the third quarter was just over million we expect positive fee trends heading into  on slide we highlight our expenses and third quarter came in at million including million of restructuring costs previously mentioned core expenses continued to trend lower largely driven by the reduction of expense following the sale of abrc we expect the expense initiatives executed in  to provide further savings as we move into and as you can see from the lower right chart on an adjusted or run rate basis our expenses to average assets ratio is already trending below as shown on slide our regulatory capital levels remain strong at the end of  our regulatory capital levels were at or above where we ended the year for and our tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to tangible book value per share also increased to per share up from in the prior quarter reflecting the net added benefit to shareholders of the actions we took during the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 on slide we are updating select items for the remainder of and reiterating our expense guidance for we expect a net interest margin of or slightly higher in the fourth quarter we expect fee revenue to continue on a positive trend through the end of expenses for  are expected to come in at million including about million of remaining restructuring costs we reiterate our fullyear expenses are expected to be approximately million the fullyear tax rate will be in the low to midsingle digits and we expect the fullyear tax rate to be between and thank you with that wed be happy to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will conduct our questionandanswer session operator instructions one moment please while we pole for questions our first question comes from michael young with truist securities please state your question michael young q analyst truist securities hey thanks for taking the question wanted to ask about loan growth you mentioned commercial construction pipeline i think you said billion yet to be funded so it sounds like thats a pretty nice tailwind or potential bridge to return to stronger loan growth is that the right way to think about that or theres some other offsets that that we should be thinking of in some of the other commercial categories philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah thanks michael so yes certainly commercial real estate as youve seen throughout the year will continue to provide loan growth based upon the backlog we have and there is some amount of new business being done in that area as well our specialty areas our utilities the mortgage warehouse business continue to show good growth and we expect certainly the power and utilities area to keep growing mortgage warehouse will depend upon refinance activity the mortgage business still has some tailwind and we may choose to retain some of our mortgage production going forward general commercial lending probably somewhat slow we dont have great visibility into that line item into next year yet but we expect to have more information on that as we get through the fourth quarter and get to the january call so there are certain areas that continue to show good growth there are areas that continue to have the backlog like cre that will fund up but general activity in the commercial lending space need to show some more growth going forward and well see what happens as we go along michael young q analyst truist securities okay and just maybe on a core basis as were thinking about the margin for next year is really kind of loan growth the main driving factor to upside from kind of what youve already talked about in terms of just the funding costs coming down philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 so we expect our liabilities to continue to ph grind lower we took the actions on the fhlb prepayment which is a significant improvement to nii next year we are getting decent traction on closing floors on our libor based loans which is the bulk of our loans well continue to work on that so the combination of ph grinding liability cost down the fhlb prepayment libor floors and then transitioning to new indices should provide stable to growing nim as we look forward but well have better guidance for you in january on that michael young q analyst truist securities okay and if i could just sneakin one last one just on the commercial deferrals i understand obviously those have come down a good bit but i guess are there some that have been modified is there a large portion thats maybe paying interest only or some other modification has been made thats maybe not captured in that deferral number philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so were down to of the total commercial and commercial technical difficulty that have requested some additional deferral pat do you have a little more color on that for michael patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i would say on the commercial book its really casebycase how were looking at those theres definitely a mix where weve got clients that have moved to maybe an interestonly we have some hotel the hotel industry obviously is going to need some more time so those modifications are a little more customized to kind of bridge them for at least the next year plus so theres a lot of nuances that kind of go with each credit from that standpoint michael young q analyst truist securities is there an amount thats just been modified i mean would it be would it closely match kind of that initial million or is it more like million i dont know if theres any way to kind of ballpark that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well the modified loans pat correct me if im wrong are included in the million that you see michael michael young q analyst truist securities right okay patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp the bulk of those have rolled off and dont need any further assistance or modification michael young q analyst truist securities associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 okay so they are fully captured in that number thank you appreciate it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please state your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question first one hopefully its a pretty basic one im just given all the moving parts i just want to make sure i understand sort of what you guys think the run rate cost base is in the third quarter so im just trying to square with on slide with the commentary in the text so if we just take the million and million that would give us somewhere around million in core expenses so you have the million of restructuring costs which i think is the fhlb as well as the real estate where exactly do the million of severance costs where do we see that those indiscernible philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp that million is embedded in that million so you can take it out of there too scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect so then were talking about a core number of somewhere in like million range is that a fair way fair approximation philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp for that quarter yes r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect yeah sorry for that kind of basic one on that just trying to get philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thats okay r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co through all the moving parts all right perfect and then associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp indiscernible moving parts really r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah and then more just a top level one on how this credit cycle kind of plays out it seems like every days we sort of push out the time so we see more accelerated loss migration i guess with the benefit of a at least a bit more clarity of visàvis say days ago phil maybe how are you thinking about when we should expect losses to begin to accelerate at some point in is that like a mid or even later event or how are you guys preparing for things philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp its always hard to tell you can see that our reserve build is moderating to being pretty flattish at this point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think so much depends on is there more stimulus whats the economy look like as we get into next year but theres a from here theres probably putting aside oil and gas but from here youve probably a couple three quarters out before you kind of push this lump of troubled credits through the pipeline and see what comes out so i think theres a lag to go and of course we saw in our oil and gas that weve done i think a good job of winding that down and getting that behind us so we still have the fall redetermination period to come were about a third of the way through that without any issues but were still holding significant reserves in the event that we have on additional troubled credits there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right well thank you guys very much i appreciate it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please state your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon guys on your capital slide you typically prioritize your usage for excess capital i didnt see it this quarter i was wondering if you could kind of run through how youre thinking about excess capital specifically the buyback just given where the share price is relative to tangible book value associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so that leaving out the chart question that we havent changed our level of priorities but it is more than fair to say when were trading at a discount to book which frankly we dont understand why we are given all of our actions and given our outlook but when were trading at that type of level share buybacks certainly become interesting to us its probably still a little bit early but as we get into next year terry clearly as we sit with growing capital and depending on where were trading at share buybacks become of great interest terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then just as a followup the billion plus of retail and shopping centers how much of that is just what i call typical your typical mall which has may have been struggling precovid and if we just havent seen chargeoffs at all just for the whole bank what are your thoughts there in terms of when the deferrals run out whats the most susceptible is it that traditional mall and if so how big is the portfolio and do you have any kind of stats average ltv or something like that to give us some color on the portfolio philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure pat do you want to give some color on the mallbased stuff patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure in general the stuff that were seeing that continues to struggle is all going to be in closed mall kind of space where you just with the social distancing et cetera people are struggling to get into our majority of our retailers are in that what ill call neighborhood strip center mall net lease space and those have all seen rent collections come back almost to normal levels lot of those have come off deferral so we feel pretty good about them theres still a handful that were dealing with and then in terms of we really only have a handful one or two maybe other in closed mall exposures to public reit that have been so far those remaining ones have been performing well other than the two phil mentioned earlier the nonaccrual so right now we feel pretty we have a pretty good trajectory on the retail client base terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you pat and thank you phil as well philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks operator operator instructions our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please state your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you talk a little bit about the timing of the expense reductions for the branch optimization project how we should roll that in philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so the consolidations internal will be done this quarter the sales in peoria and of two branches in southwest wisconsin will complete this quarter we expect them to complete this quarter and the remaining one branch which were selling to a thirdparty will close sometime in the first quarter so you should expect to see everything clean starting january with a very minor exception of one branch jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah and so the message is similar to your commentary on net interest income with the million youre saying it could be as simple as just putting an extra million taking million out of expenses for  is that fair philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well chris whats the i think we have all the charges through in the fourth quarter right christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp correct yes so as you said should be a clean from january so jon i think youre thinking it as the right way jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good thank you for that any comments on a service charge rebound the magnitude of what you expect or is that just i know theres a bit of a bounce back but any commentary there philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so we expect to see continued growth there as you know at the start of the pandemic we gave quite a bit of relief to customers that is now completely rolled off as we get into  and rightly or wrongly economic activity has picked up particularly in the wisconsin footprint and so were seeing more activity there as well so in our guidance that we expect to see fee income continuing to grow into the fourth quarter is based on those factors jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 okay and then one more and maybe not an easy question but youve had some really good deposit growth in the last few quarters and do you all think about how much of this might be permanent versus temporary if things return to normal philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp chris do you have a view on that you want to express christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so jon i think if youd asked us a couple of quarters ago certainly we would have said we saw it all surge as we sit here moving into october and the balances have stayed through the entire third quarter theyre staying as we sit as we move into the fourth quarter were starting to feel indiscernible lot stickier which is part of the reason we are comfortable repaying the million of federal home loan bank advances because we think a good portion of this is sticky and the dollars that were still continues to see come in we think will continue to be sticky as we move forward so as we sit here today it feels a lot stickier than we would have expected and it feels like we have room to move things around jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help guys philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please state your question kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi this is actually kelly motta in for chris thanks for taking my questions i guess you talked a lot about what youve done on the funding side with prepaying that fhlb borrowings and ph youre still repricing these lower just wondering if you can give us color on reinvestment yields of securities and how new loan yields compared to what you have on book right now philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp okay chris you want to handle that christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so on the reinvestment securities i think one of the things to keep in mind is were not aggressively growing the balances and so what youre seeing here is essentially relatively stable levels to what youll see reported for this third quarter averages and not a lot of net movement because of incremental significant investment activity so i dont expect you to see the continuing drift downward because there just isnt a lot of net new that were expecting to put into that portfolio associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 on the commercial loans i think we showed the trends on the slides and again weve tried to highlight monthly trends so if you take a look at the slide page youll notice that commercial loan yields actually bottomed in june as for the commercial and business lending and weve been working with the business on spreads and floors in order to sort of bounce that back up a few basis points and hold that line above basis points on the commercial booking as a whole over the last several quarters and that seems to have gone successfully and that reflects the activity were doing on new you can also see the commercial real estate has held steady and again what were holding in portfolio is holding steady on the residential book as well so i think those monthtomonth trend line give you a good indication as to where the new volume coming in kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you and then last question for me on tax rate with potentially tax rate is going up again from washington is there any differences on how we should think about it or is kind of looking at it what happened in so kind of a valid proxy thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well okay your guess on what happens is as good as ours but our best guess right now is that weve got tax rates in that to 17ish range but that can all change kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time ill turn it back to philip flynn for closing remarks thank you philip b flynn president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks well everybody please stay safe thanks for joining us today we look forward to talking to you again in january and as always if you have any questions give us a call and thanks as always for your interest in associated operator thank you this concludes todays conference all parties may disconnect have a good day associated banccorp asb
