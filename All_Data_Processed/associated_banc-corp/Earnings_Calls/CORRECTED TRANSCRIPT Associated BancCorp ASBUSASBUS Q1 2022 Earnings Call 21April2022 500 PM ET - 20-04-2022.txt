harmening president and ceo for opening remarks please go ahead sir andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you hillary and good afternoon everyone welcome to our first quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined here today by chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahem our chief credit officer id like to start things off by covering the highlights of the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives from there chris is going to walk through our updates on income expense and capital and then pat will follow up with an update on our credit trends so here in the upper midwest we continue to see signs of a strong economy in our footprint covid restrictions have largely been eased or lifted and employment trends remain remarkably strong with unemployment rates in wisconsin and minnesota now down below we also continue to see encouraging strength in our commercial loan pipelines and utilization rates giving us confidence that the momentum we began to see in manufacturing back in the second half of is in fact carrying over into meanwhile all of our new lending initiatives are now fully now are now officially up and running putting associated position to deliver more and relevant product solutions to our customers while the war in ukraine continuing supply chain disruptions and inflation issue post significant question marks at the macro level our core customer base has remained resilient and continues to borrow and to grow this resilience is seen in the overall credit trends in our loan portfolios which largely continue to improve as we continue to transform the bank one of our biggest opportunities is to listen to our customers and then take action guided by their feedback we announced that were making several changes to our overdraft program and these changes will significantly reduce the financial burden of overdrafts to our customers in summary we have positioned associated to be in a far better place than we were a year ago today were in a strong position to deliver expanding margins continued positive operating leverage and enhanced value to all of our stakeholders so now let me touch on the first quarter highlights that are outlined on slide this quarter was marked by meaningful growth in our core loan portfolios disciplined expense management improving credit dynamics and strong bottom line results our total loans grew at a annualized rate on both an average and a periodend basis and excluding ppp average commercial and business loans expanded at an even faster annualized pace this loan growth along with our continued investment strategies helped drive net interest income and margins higher despite having two fewer days in the quarter now shifting to expenses we managed our total expenses down quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear while simultaneously increasing our minimum wage investing in our technology platforms and investing in our initiatives we attribute these savings to the significant actions we took to consolidate our operations and support functions in the latter half of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 with respect to credit we would highlight that we are posting a modest net recovery this quarter portfolio metrics continue to be strong and stable as we keep a close eye on geopolitical and economic risks taken together loan growth margin expansion expense discipline and strong credit drove robust eps of and another quarter of doubledigit returns on capital so turning to slide id like to provide a little more detail on the loan trends we saw in the quarter looking to our average balances we had net loan growth across all of our core business segments consumer loans grew as our auto finance vertical kicked into gear and commercial lending grew including our new verticals more than offset the headwinds of the mortgage warehouse and ppp general commercial lending again showed strong momentum reflecting broad underlying loan demand indiscernible customer base on slide wed like to highlight several dynamics which give us confidence in the continuation of the loan trends weve seen emerging over the past several quarters first the lefthand side of this page highlights the emerging total commercial growth weve experienced aside from the dual headwinds of ppp and mortgage warehouse our commercial portfolio at march was up yearoveryear and expanded at doubledigit annualized growth rates versus the third quarter this has largely been fueled by a rebound in commercial ci balances growth from our new abl and equipment finance initiatives as well as increased line utilization and we still see upside and room for more borrowing as the economic environment continues to normalize now second on the lower right wed also highlight that our back book of unfunded cre construction projects has continued to grow yearoveryear weve added over billion in unfunded commitments most of which wed expect to see funded over the next months and while the first quarter is seasonally slow for construction in our markets we fully expect this activity to pick up as the spring weather arrives in our footprint underscoring the points i just made id like to affirm our full year loan targets on slide with respect to commercial loans we expect to end the year with billion of outstandings excluding abl and equipment finance which ill touch on in a moment given the growth that weve seen the robust pipelines that continue have continued to grow since yearend and the funding activity we expect to see this quarter were confident were on track to hit our commercial loan goals for the year even with the headwind of dampening our mortgage warehouse activity were also pleased to update you on the strong progress were driving in our new abl and equipment finance verticals weve strengthened the teams both groups have added commitments and outstandings during the quarter and we feel very confident about the million target weve set for yearend so taken together we expect our total commercial book to end the year at approximately billion turning to auto finance the first quarter demonstrated our teams ability to deliver we expect this portfolio to continue to grow strongly and maintain its strong credit profile as we roll out the program to our broader dealer network and into our core footprints later this year in summary despite some uncertainty in the markets and modest headwinds such as mortgage warehouse we expect to achieve our lending growth targets in now turning to slide let me make a few comments with respect to our continued investment in talent our digital transformation and our capital priorities with respect to talent weve continued to add new relationship and portfolio managers to our commercial and small business teams during the quarter and are on track to hire to bankers by yearend we also opened our houston cre office during the quarter and continue to ramp up our abl and equipment finance teams associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 on the digital front we crossed a milestone by launching our internal pilot for our new ncr digital platform which we plan to roll out to all of our consumer customers this summer now this is one im personally very excited about because its going to give us an open architecture platform its going to allow us to integrate both customization and fintech solutions turning to capital we remain committed to optimizing our capital to support our customers in that means focusing squarely on organic growth we see plenty of loan growth in our outlook and envision using all of our capital to support that growth while paying a competitive dividend we continue to see our investments and strategies as creating a differentiated growth path for associated that will drive further margin and efficiency gains in a time where we are already expecting to see significant tailwinds from the rate environment so let me pause there for a moment and hand it over to chris niles our chief financial officer to provide a little more detail on our revenue and income statement trends for the quarter chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy turning to slide net interest income continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter the increase came as we put our excess liquidity to work in loans and securities as we had previously indicated our nim bottomed out last year and has continued to inch higher each quarter since given the rising rate environment our general assetsensitive profile and the anticipated impacts of our growth initiatives we fully expect our nim to continue to expand and come in above the level which we already saw during the month of march we now expect shortterm interest rates to rise following each of this years upcoming fomc meetings assuming those rate increases are basis points at least following this meeting we would expect our fullyear net interest income to exceed million on slide we highlight that weve purchased securities which have been participating and moved higher in rates an effect weve been averaging up into the yields were earning even as weve reined in durations our blended investment yields for the quarter continue to move higher and our total portfolio yields have improved by nearly basis points since the third quarter in anticipation of higher rates we also took steps in  to redesignate billion of our securities from afs to htm nonetheless our aoci does reflect a million reduction in the value of the portfolio during the quarter this aoci impacts net of earnings drove the basis point reduction in our tce which you can see on our tables our tce nonetheless ended the quarter at moving on to slide we continue to benefit from our strong deposit trends in a time of year when we might typically expect to see a postnew year outflow average deposits were up million quarteroverquarter and up yearoveryear growth continues to be concentrated in our lowcost deposit categories such as our savings and interestbearing demand accounts for consumers with rates expected to rise throughout the year we may see some outflows later in the year and would expect deposit pricing to heat up at some point but so far we have not seen customers reduce balances and were not seeing competitive pressure to raise rates in our markets associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 moving on to slide our core feebased revenues came in modestly ahead of last years comparable quarters total noninterest revenues did not improve yearoveryear with notable reductions in mortgage banking revenue asset gains and branch sales as well as slightly reduced indiscernible income with the expectation for continued rising rates we see mortgage banking revenue further moderating as we move through the year we also expect that higher rates will ultimately translate into higher earning credit rates for some commercial deposit customers which will have the effect of dampening commercial deposit fees later in the year as andy mentioned we also announced several changes to our odnsf programs today that will impact our run rate for fees beginning the third quarter while these changes are intended to reduce the burden on our customers they will also reduce our deposit service charge revenues by approximately million in given our outlook for higher rates and the revised expectations of lower service charges revenue from both commercial and consumer customers over the back half of the year we are therefore modifying our fullyear noninterest income guidance moderately downward we would now expect total noninterest income for the full year of between million and million moving on to slide first quarter expenses came in at million million lower than  amid reduced personnel and other expenses in alignment with the strategic initiatives we announced last fall we do expect to scale up investments in areas such as technology and personnel later in the year but as we continue to execute our plans we remain committed to maintaining our expense growth in line with the revenue and the revenue expectations taking all of our initiatives in consideration we continue to expect our full year noninterest expense will be in the range of million to million on slide we provided a walk forward of our quarterly pretax preprovision income from the fourth quarter of to  of while our noninterest income was down from the prior quarter our pretax preprovision income grew by million quartertoquarter despite having two fewer days in the period we estimate our daily interest accrual benefit at about million per day slide shows the fourth quarter trend of our ptpp income as youll recall we had stated back in july that we expected pretax preprovision to consistently come in above the million baseline we said in  im pleased to confirm that weve delivered on that and held to that statement over the past three quarters furthermore we expect ptpp to continue to trend higher as we expand our operating leverage throughout and into moving on to slide we remain disciplined from a capital perspective and continue to drive our capital ratios towards their targets as we continue to grow loans on the balance sheet as i mentioned previously the aoci impact we realized in our securities book was a key driver of our decrease in the tce quarteroverquarter so thanks to strong earnings and the redesignation actions we took in the quarter our tangible book value per share only decreased we will continue to target tce levels of and cet1 levels of ill now turn it over to pat ahern our chief credit officer for a credit quality update patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks chris id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide we utilized the moodys february baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent and assumes additional fiscal support a continued relatively low interest rate environment the recent acceleration in consumer prices to be transitory and relatively localized covid cases associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 following net reserve releases in all four quarters of we posted another negative provision in  of and saw net recoveries as opposed to net chargeoffs during the quarter our acll as of march was million down from million at yearend during  the reduction in acll was driven primarily by a million reduction in oil and gas as that portfolio continues to run off our ratio of reserves to loans declined slightly to from during the quarter turning to slide we highlight our quarterly credit trends as andy mentioned most of our key credit metrics continued to improve over the course of the quarter nonaccrual loans did pick up slightly quarteroverquarter with the increase tied to one specific credit nonetheless total nonaccruals were down yearoveryear while in total restructured loans and delinquencies have fluctuated over the past five quarters they have now decreased quarteroverquarter and have decreased by million versus  of going forward we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk rates economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat so on slide we recap our full year guidance for over the remainder of we remain bullish about loan growth specifically we continue to expect full year auto finance loan growth of over billion and total commercial loan growth of million to billion in our forecast we had anticipated a basis point increase at each fomc meeting this year and accordingly we expect our full year net interest income to exceed million given this revised rate outlook we are also modifying our fee income guidance to account for lower mortgage banking and service charge revenue throughout the remainder of the year as such we now expect total noninterest income to be between million and million for the full year and then taken together we now expect the combined total of net interest and fee income to exceed billion lastly our commitment to expense discipline remains a focus and we continue to expect between million and million of noninterest expense in so with that wed like to open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from scott siefers of piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co chris maybe for hey first question for you the million favorable delta in the nii guidance so is that completely due to the higher rate expectation or are there any other nuances in there im guessing its mostly due to rates given no change to the loan growth or securities portfolio outlooks but just curious to hear your thoughts christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah its ratedriven weve been monitoring spreads and i think that reflects our expectations around rates and their impact on spreads and deposit betas which weve continued to get comfort in as weve gone through the quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay and i think last quarter you alluded to sort of a million per month benefit from each fed rate hike is that still a good rule of thumb in your mind christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so we would say that the million incorporates the early benefit of the first ph million and the marginal above and beyond that its probably a little tampered down so about million per month for any rate rise above ph million so for example ill be a little more specific than i was last time if theres basis points in may we would see the bps that that benefits start to show up in june and so youd have seven months of additional million benefit to the extent theres basis points in may for example so the million would be 847ish million r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 okay perfect and then i guess final question how are you thinking about overall balance sheet growth specifically earning asset growth for the full year i guess another way of asking sort of deposit flow expectations christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so we have seen our deposits remain remarkably resilient and so the balance sheet is going to be driven by the asset growth from our perspective and were reaffirming all of the asset growth numbers here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay good thank you guys very much christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you scott operator our next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon this is timur braziler filling in for jared maybe just following up on the deposit question i appreciate the comments that is typically seasonally weaker and held up better this go around just given kind of the liquidity that you still have in your balance sheet the loan and deposit ratio to the extent that there are incremental outflows here in the second quarter which we have seen in the past are you okay just kind of letting those flow through and having the loan and deposit ratio tick up higher or is there an expectation that youll kind of offset those exiting deposits with either brokered money or wholesale funding andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well this is andy and of course we always have the option of funding it on the wholesale market what i would say is that were in a pretty good position from a core funding standpoint today but if you look at some of the initiatives weve talked about our commercial bankers our business bankers weve added since i got here roughly increase in relationship managers those folks dont do just loans theyre in our core markets and they will start to drive our deposit strategies were also launching a mass affluent strategy and i can tell you that i see the index of our mass affluent customers and in a consumer bank they make up of the deposits were underindexed in the amount we have from each of those this will be the third time ive launched this type of strategy at a bank and i know what to expect we will see additional growth at the tail end of the year going into the next year were a top hsa provider that is a very depositheavy business we have the infrastructure and well continue to invest in that well invest in our digital account opening well invest in our branch account opening so some of the things we havent talked as much about will directly relate to how we fund our core deposits over time associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 so to answer the question we do feel like we have sufficient liquidity from different sources but were also making sure we are prepared from a balance sheet standpoint from both the loan side and deposit side timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you and then on the loan side i guess how much of an expected remaining headwind is there out of the mortgage warehouse portfolio and im assuming as that stabilizes as ppp becomes less of an issue these new initiatives are going to result in faster kind of balance sheet and loan growth is there another leg lower in the second quarter for warehouse and then we really start to see loan growth accelerate in the back end of the year or do you think that much of the warehouse reduction has already been addressed here in the first quarter andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so i think youre hitting the nail on the head a little bit there we dont expect the yearend balances to be much different than what we forecasted we just expect this we just we have seen that more quickly with the ramp up in rates so we still expect a modest decrease in mortgage warehouse the rest of the year but not at the rate that we saw in the first quarter as you add rms and as you mature these initiatives we expect our pipeline is the highest weve seen in six months so we expect that to follow through and pull through to the balance sheet so yes therell be a slight dampening and thats why i use the term modest on purpose well see a modest dampening of mortgage warehouse where it was much more significant in the first quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last for me on the expenses great to see the expense control in the first quarter and i guess im a little bit surprised that with it didnt come a reduction in fullyear guidance i know you talked about some personnel spend and technology spend in the back end of the year but i mean how much of that is more so you guys being conservative on that front versus kind of planned dollars in the pipeline that you have visibility to coming in the remainder of the year thats going to drive expenses kind of to that guided level andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah great question im going to take your first comment as a im going to say thank you for the kudos on expense management and what i would say is look this is a growth story and as we grow we have to invest to grow and so we expect as we go through the year were going to add another on the rm side that will set us up not for this year because the folks weve already hired have set us up for this year thatll set us up for the end of the year heading into next year so we want to continue to fuel this and we expect as we put out in our strategic initiatives that we expect positive operating leverage which we are achieving and we believe will achieve throughout the year and so in order to do that you have to reinvest in the business and so we see that steady growth but well control that investment to make sure it lines up with our revenue growth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it great thank you for the questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from terry mcevoy of stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey terry christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe big picture question for andy a lot of what youve done has been on the lending side and i guess deposits which you highlighted as well what are your thoughts on adding to the fee income businesses when i look at your outlook its about fee income which my gut tells me that is a bit light versus some peers so do you have any kind of bigger picture plans on expanding fee businesses once these lending platforms are up and running andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah its a good question ill say a couple of things one the mass affluent strategy in order to be a good wealth bank a really good wealth bank having the mass affluent piece in place is really important what happens is you have the initial conversation with people that are switchers that move money those folks that are in the mass affluent bucket which is to million they grow into wealth customers and you upstream those folks so as we launch the mass affluent our expectation is we will rebrand our wealth business we will have a digital road map for wealth that aligns with the conversations were having and then ultimately well start to feed that business but getting the mass affluent first is important for us well have a focus on the commercial business which we do believe can drive some additional fees whether thatd be treasury management or capital markets but that is just getting started for us so terry i think your observation is right there is a lot on the margin side of this and over time we believe that we can build the capabilities some organically on the fee income side of that through wealth and commercial banking terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 thanks for that and then maybe my followup for chris is about a million increase in quarteroverquarter mortgage is that a function of earlier in the year adopting kind of fair value of your msr and just seeing that asset worth more value more today than three months ago christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so if i look at them yeah the short answer to your question is yes just so that were on the same page mortgage banking net was only up modestly quarteroverquarter but the lift for the quarter was all driven by looking at how we adopted fair value and it came in as we expected but was a contributor to the lift yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thank you chris thanks andy christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you bye terry operator our next question is from daniel tamayo of raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp indiscernible daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc really its been a good story on the credit quality front weve had a few issues there but just the nonaccrual that you mentioned it looks like it was a commercial real estate nonaccrual in the quarter if theres any other detail around industry or anything like that that you could provide id be interested thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no as we mentioned it was really one specific credit given some events around that we feel confident that were not going to see a longterm loss there but well continue to watch it in terms of what were seeing in commercial real estate space its been pretty resilient as with anyone else were watching the cre office asset class we feel pretty good about how weve been pretty conservative underwriting that asset class over the historical period but were always monitoring and doing probably further deep dives than we had in the past just given the shifts coming out of covid and how tenants are going to start using their space associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for that and then the nsf fees that are going to be coming out is that just a modeling question the million is that literally just million a quarter is that going to be started later in the third quarter or is that just july from a time perspective andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i think this is andy from a modeling perspective we expect that million is really a halfyear impact so doubling that up our annualized impact is about million so it is roughly million a quarter daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay perfect all right thats all i had i appreciate the answers andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from chris mcgratty of kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks maybe a question for chris last cycle you guys youve made some efforts to reduce the network deposits and those dollars have come down i guess where could you be surprised in your deposit base we saw some of your peers have some chunky movements this quarter you obviously didnt but where could you be surprised christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp well ill go with andys approach thank you for the kudos on the management that we did here over the last couple of years to make sure that when the rates started to turn again we wouldnt be in a position of being surprised and so id say we worked hard to make sure that wasnt the dynamics as you point out and as we show on our tables the entire amount of network deposit was down to million and that number was close to billion at one point in time so dramatic role reversing that where we i think were most concerned is the significant uplift in noninterestbearing and so the noninterest bearing is up to billion which is a remarkable and wonderful thing and if you would ask me which andy did whats going to happen in the first quarter the answer was well theyre going to flow out and they didnt and if youd ask me whats going to happen after april ph this years tax day i would have said well well associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 see a downtick and we havent and so the reality is theyre proving to be a lot stickier than i would have expected and thats been a positive but thats the biggest risk but so far knocking on wood here we just havent seen it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great color thanks chris maybe a second one on just pricing for the auto business can you just remind us what part of the curve is priced off how has spreads and pricing held up given competition christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so on page of the press release tables we break out the yield for the auto finance portfolio which for the quarter came in at i havent looked at everyones results on that basis but andy did have me look at a bank based in ohio that has a big auto book and i noticed that our yields are about basis points higher than theirs so i guess were in sync christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks operator our next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey on slide when youre going through your prepared comments andy you made a comment about construction lending and i missed a part of it and i think i understood what youre saying but can you go through that again in terms of what youre seeing on your backlog andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i mean the crux of it is our unfunded commitments continue to grow on the construction side so clearly our belief is as we get into heavier construction season we have an opportunity for growth so weve put on roughly a million increase yearoveryear in commercial construction cre construction so what were associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 saying is we believe that will serve as a tailwind for growth for us the rest of this year and really the expectation is that does fund that entire amount over roughly an 18month period of time jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good the other question i had is kind of nuanced but the general commercial your averages were up about to ph but period end it was up about ph whats the subtlety there andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i know its sometimes different to compare the average to period end im just curious to know andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure i think if you look on page you can see its not that subtle its mortgage warehouse thats the biggest part of it thats christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp indiscernible the total commercial indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc general commercial general commercial andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah what we had done on there is weve shown kind of the fourth quarter combined with the first quarter because we had a very big fourth quarter in commercial and so that dampened a little we pulled forward some of those deals they happened to close pretty quickly the nonsubtlety that you cant see is we have our highest pipeline in the last six months so weve been able to refill that during the first quarter so a little bit of accelerated ill hit it once drain that a little build it back up to where it was and then some significantly above there so thats whats giving us confidence in the growth as we see the general ci on the goforward basis jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then maybe more philosophical on the change in overdrafts i think we all understand what the bigger banks are doing on it im just curious if you can gain from this i know theres a loss that we talk about associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 financially but can you gain from this relative to some of your other competitors that may not be waiving overdraft fees to your small and medium sized competitors andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp its hard to predict what their actions are going to be in the future but when you do things that are in a customers favor and you do it willingly that usually serves as a positive when it comes to satisfaction so our expectation is that as they see this theres only a positive response to this im particularly pleased with the nsf fee that will go away as that those nsf fees are overdrafts that arent paid so to know that goes away i really like that one in particular although all of them are in the customers favor so my answer probably cant be relative to others because thats a fluid situation but i do expect a positive response from our own customer base jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay last one pat for you anything youre wary of if we do get fed funds at basis points by the end of the year anything that makes you nervous about that patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp no not really were sizing all of our upfront underwriting to were sensitizing interest rates were looking out kind of especially in the real estate book the commercial real estate book to an exit so were building a lot of that stuff into our underwriting it hasnt happened the last couple of years we might start to see it now but right now like i said the book overall is doing very well the one item were watching like everyone else is just the office jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks for the help guys appreciate it patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp all right thanks for the interest operator our next question is from michael young of truist securities please proceed with your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thank you for taking the question jon took a couple of mine but i did want to take another crack at the higher rates sort of question and just as we move later in this year and we are at higher levels of absolute rates is there any interest in maybe turning back on or putting some mortgage on the balance sheet at kind of higher interest rates or is that still kind of really in runoff even once we reach those levels christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i would say were not really in runoff what we say is balance will be relatively stable and so clearly mortgage rates in the high and even are relatively attractive but so is a growing commercial book and so is our auto associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 book and so i think weve got focus on growth but we wont turn blind eyes to opportunities and what we might say is if i can put on a mortgage at or a security at sometimes the mortgage looks better michael young q analyst truist securities inc got you and then my followup question was actually just on auto obviously its been performing well thus far but consumers are starting to feel a little bit more of a pinch are you guys seeing any early signs or anything that youre monitoring more closely now just kind of with the inflation backdrop and the squeeze on some consumers andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp its an interesting question of whos feeling the pinch and what that means and what were hearing and seeing is the subprime market is feeling the pinch and maybe those delinquencies are at a level that may be similar to pre pandemic we virtually dont have that in our portfolio so were not seeing that the second thing is general consumer is fairly healthy relative to where they entered the crisis from a average liquidity position so the answer is the consumer is fairly healthy in the segments that were lending to we have not seen anything and we wont have a blind eye to that with inflation at the levels that we have and the actions that are being taken having geopolitical conflict but we like the way that were lending into a very prime super prime customer michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks very much andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys its timur again just one more followup on auto the implied balance for yearend kind of suggests a similar growth rate to what weve seen here in the first quarter im just wondering as you continue to roll out that product set to the rest of your footprint does that growth accelerate is there something that youre going to be doing on your end to kind of limit that growth to that billion billion by yearend i would just love to hear your comments on the trajectory of the expected growth rate in auto andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so this is andy ill take that one and the way that i would answer that is while i like the auto vertical we dont want to be just an auto bank we want to be lending across the spectrum and using our capital for commercial for business banking for abl for equipment finance for auto associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 i also want to make sure that were operationally solid and strong as we go through this so we dont i dont feel i need to put too much pressure on this machine to me billion in growth is a strong year and so if we are getting returns if we are operationally strong if we believe that it fits within the capital usage of all the other pieces of that that will bear out what our decision is but as it goes right now with the pipelines that were seeing in commercial and the successful launch of multiple initiatives the successful hiring of talented rms on the commercial side i really like the balance that were getting right now i very much want to get into footprints i actually think that with our brand name and our recognition its actually a product while its indirect it actually can translate on the direct side for our customer base and so thats probably where our focus is and i dont feel the need to come out and modify the forecast on that for the sake of volume timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it okay thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator we have reached the end of the
