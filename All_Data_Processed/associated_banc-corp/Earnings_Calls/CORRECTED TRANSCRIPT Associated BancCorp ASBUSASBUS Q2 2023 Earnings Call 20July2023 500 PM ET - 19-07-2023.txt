asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you alicia and good afternoon everyone welcome to our second quarter earnings call im andy harmening i am joined once again by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer ill start by sharing some highlights for the quarter and from there derek will provide update on margin income trends and capital and then pat will share an update on credit so midway through the year weve started to see some renewed stability through the banking system and thats especially true here in the midwest unemployment rates in most of our states remain below the national average the consumer remains healthy and our business customers continue to seek ways to expand and optimize their operations where it makes sense and with that stability as our backdrop weve continued to make progress with our plan to attract deepen and retain customer relationships optimize our balance sheet and enhance our profitability profile over time you can see it in our loan portfolios where weve continued to add significant volumes of highquality consumer and commercial loans to our books you can see it on the deposit side where were deepening relationships with our mass affluent strategy and acquiring new relationships the brandnew brand campaign and multiple product and service enhancements and you can see it in digital where weve already made several upgrades to the new platform we launched less than a year ago leading to an increased customer satisfaction score and a decreased customer attrition rate we have become a company that has developed an ability to execute even amid a volatile quarter in banking but importantly weve reached these milestones without sacrificing our foundational discipline on credit quality and expense management we look forward to carrying the momentum into the back half of this year so with that id like to highlight key results for the second quarter on slide our second quarter results reflected the continued expansion of our balance sheet stable credit trends and progress against our initiatives we added loan balances in all three major segments again in the second quarter led by ci and auto finance however as we discussed a quarter ago lending activity as a whole has slowed from the strong pace we saw in to fund our growth and enhance our liquidity profile we tapped the wholesale markets to increase deposits by billion during the quarter this reliance on wholesale funding sources is expected to dissipate over time as we begin to realize the full impact of our customer acquisition and relationshipdeepening initiatives with the increased funding costs impacting the entire industry our net interest margin came in at which is down from our fourth quarter peak but is still basis points above the same period a year ago as a partial offset to margin pressures we saw noninterest income increase by million from the prior quarter helping us deliver ptpp income of million for the quarter a million increase from the same period a year ago we are continuing to monitor asset quality closely but our credit trends remain relatively stable during the second quarter we saw basis points of net chargeoffs during the quarter and added basis point of acll we added million in provision for the quarter but still matched our net income available to common equity from the same period a year ago now staying on the topic of credit like to take a moment to reiterate a few important points about who we are as a company on slide we take an active disciplined and conservative approach to credit this includes an ongoing and deep review of existing portfolios and in addition our efforts to derisk our balance sheet over the associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 past years have put us in a relative position of strength since weve taken steps to exit highrisk portfolios replace those balances with lower risk asset classes and implement processes and procedures to identify and eliminate risk and today were squarely focused on primesuper prime consumers core commercial lending and a diversified balance sheet this broad focus has protected us from overextending ourselves in any one particular area and limited our exposure in atrisk subcategories such as cre office we also benefit from operating primarily in stable conservative midwestern markets that dont see the big swings you might see in other parts of the country as mentioned previously this longheld disciplined approach on credit has also given us the flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives in the face of a dynamic operating environment with that id like to provide some details on our loan trends on slide during the second quarter we continue to add highquality loans to the balance sheet in areas such as ci and auto finance weve now reported growth in each major segment for five consecutive quarters and while weve continued to book loans the pace of new deals coming into the pipeline has slowed as our customers take a more cautious approach in the uncertain macro environment within our portfolio we continue to emphasize selective growth in highquality loan categories that help us diversify our portfolio while delivering an enhanced profitability profile over the last seven quarters the expansion of our ci business and growth in our new equipment finance and assetbased lending verticals has helped us expand our offerings and sharpen our focus on highquality relationship based lending this enables us to de emphasize lower yielding nonrelationship asset classes such as thirdparty originated mortgage as we announced back in  weve chosen to exit this lowmargin business with relatively low relationship value we originated approximately billion of these loans in and we now expect to originate just million in as we wind down this business to focus on other areas that enable us to optimize our returns over time so in summary we remain confident in our ability to drive high quality accretive growth on our balance sheet and as such we continue to expect loan growth of between and in on slide we highlight our funding trends for the second quarter during the quarter we tapped the wholesale and broker deposit markets to help enhance our liquidity profile fund our loan growth and replace higher cost fhlb advances these actions were temporary in nature not intended to be part of our longterm strategy within our core customer deposit base we did see some shortterm volatility from a subset of uninsured businesses business deposits and public funds in march and april but that volatility largely dissipated by the end of the quarter and in the face of this challenging environment we actually saw modest growth in our consumer deposit base during the quarter the stabilization reflects the granularity of our deposit base and our recent efforts to attract and deepen customer relationships with digital tools and product enhancements we expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in check as we move through the back half of the year and we remain confident in our ability to fund our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our initiatives with that said based on current market conditions we now expect total core customer deposits to decrease by for the year however we expect to drive growth of in the back half of the year as we continue to execute on our initiatives on slide were sharing additional details on our initiatives designed to acquire deep and retain customer relationships weve continued to see promising signs of progress with these efforts weve actually seen associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 momentum pick up as we move through the year as i mentioned previously were up and running with a variety of initiatives across the bank and weve seen several leading indicators that give us confidence we are on track first in one of the most challenging environments for regional banks in years we actually grew net consumer and business households during all three months of the second quarter secondly weve implemented several enhancements to our product and service offerings and launched a new brand campaign which resulted in increase in consumer household acquisition rates and a decrease in attrition yearoveryear third i want to remind you that the new digital platform we launched last fall was built with open architecture enabling us to quickly respond to customer feedback and deliver more and more frequent upgrades since launching the platform months ago weve already successfully released nine upgrades as a result weve seen a strong positive trend in our ph top box completely satisfied customer satisfaction scores and most recently during the second quarter our satisfaction scores hit a threeyear high in mobile banking finally since launching a new mass affluent strategy to deepen relationships with high potential customers weve already added over million in net new deposits and surpassed our full year goal this growth represents a roughly increase from our prelaunch baseline as you can see were bringing in new dollars and deepening relationships with a customer base that is more satisfied while were pleased with initial results of these efforts weve yet to realize the full impact of the initiatives and were working on additional enhancements as we speak whats not going to change though is our commitment to the foundational strength of our company which is maintaining discipline with regards to credit risk expense management and operational risk management so finally on slide our team once again paired strong revenues with diligent expense management during the second quarter and despite facing despite the challenges facing the industry during the quarter our company delivered ptpp income of million which represented a increase as compared to the same period a year ago we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage during so with that im going to hand it over to derek meyer our chief financial officer to provide a little more detail on our margin income statement and capital trends for the quarter derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy starting on slide ill begin by highlighting our asset and liability rate trends through the second quarter our total asset yields have continued to rise due to rising rates and floating rate nature of our large segment of our loan book since the start of the rate cycle total earning asset yields have increased by basis points or roughly of the increase in fed funds target rate over the same period our commercial and cre portfolios largely comprised of floating rate loans have seen the largest increase on the liability side rising rates and the volatility impacting the industry this spring have combined to put additional pressure on funding costs across the industry here at associated interestbearing liability costs have now increased by basis points since the fourth quarter of or roughly of the move in fed funds target while the general scurve effect we expected to see on deposit betas has played out largely as we expected our beta accelerated following the volatility we saw in the spring our shortterm build and wholesale network funding and the ongoing mix shift away from noninterest bearing deposits accordingly our interest bearing deposit beta has now climbed to roughly since the start of the rate cycle associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 moving to slide mix shift and other funding cost pressures combined to drive a 27basis point compression in our nim for the second quarter nonetheless our nim still represented a 9basis point increase from the same period a year ago on a dollar nii basis we saw similar impacts during the quarter yet still delivered dollar nii that reflected a increase from the same period a year ago and as andy discussed we continue to take significant actions on both sides of the balance sheet to drive more durable margin over time one example is that weve gradually layered in swaps over the past several quarters to decrease our asset sensitivity and enhance the durability of our margin given the ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic picture and the likelihood of a higher for longer scenario we did not add additional swaps during the second quarter nonetheless weve continued to see our estimated nii sensitivity come down gradually by design the macro outlook remains uncertain our current expectations assume one additional 25basis point fed funds increase in september with no rate cuts in based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we now expect net interest income growth of between and in as a reminder we do not intend to call the peak on interest rate environment in but we do but we will continue to take reasonable steps over time to dampen our asset sensitivity and manage our downside risk on slide weve continued to manage our securities book in the second quarter to align with our to target throughout the past year the yield on our investments has steadily risen with the rate environment but we reined in durations to reduce our longerterm rate risk after adjusting our cet1 capital ratio to include the impacts of aoci this impact would have represented an 88basis point hit to cet1 in the second quarter this impact is up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by the rebound in rates from the decrease at the end of march as a percentage of total assets our investment security and cash positions were maintained at roughly during the quarter we continue to target investments to total assets of between to in shifting to slide noninterest income grew by million in the second quarter despite the ongoing pressure from marketdriven headwinds and customerfriendly fee adjustments that weve faced in the past several quarters the largest contributing factor for the increase was the moderate growth in mortgage banking income driven by higher msr values we also saw modest growth in cardbased wealth management and other fee based revenues these increases were partially offset by decreases in service charges boli income and asset gains despite the quarterly increase in noninterest income we continue to expect total noninterest income to track between and versus as weve discussed this anticipated compression is driven by current market dynamics and moderation of deposit account fee income due to customerfriendly overdrafts nsf changes made in the back half of these proactive changes gave us additional confidence in our ability to strengthen our low cost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability profile in and beyond moving to slide our second quarter expenses increased by versus the prior quarter amid ongoing investments to support our initiatives our fte efficiency ratio rose to during the quarter but it remained basis points below the same period a year ago additionally our noninterest expense base continues to decrease as a percent of average assets and is now down basis points from the same period last year while we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations in we are committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth over the long term on an ongoing basis we will continue to pursue associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 opportunities to optimize our expense base where possible with that in mind we now expect total noninterest expense growth of between and in shifting to slide we continue to prioritize paying a competitive dividend and funding organic growth while managing capital levels towards our target ranges during the second quarter our regulatory capital ratios grew versus the prior quarter and versus prior yearend we remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look out over the remainder of the year given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm rates to remain elevated in the near term we continue to expect tce to land between and by year end and cet1 to land between and ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start on slide with an update on our allowance trends we utilized the moodys may baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent with recent observed trends and assumes an additional nearterm rate hike gdp growth rates similar to the first half of a cooling labor market and a deceleration of inflation at the end of the second quarter our acll landed at million this figure represents an million increase from the prior quarter as allowance continues to be driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth nominal credit movement and reflects general macroeconomic trends benefiting from stability in the midwest accordingly our reserves to loan ratio increased basis point from to during the quarter moving to slide our quarterly credit trends remained stable across the portfolio during the second quarter we did see nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans delinquencies and chargeoffs increased slightly during the quarter but we view these increases as a sign of both normalization back to prepandemic levels as well as some oneoff situations as opposed to an indication of a broader issue in the portfolio we added another million in provision during the second quarter which is consistent with the past three quarters as mentioned this provision build was largely a function of loan growth limited credit movement and some macro trends given recent volatility in the industry id like to take the opportunity to reiterate that the recent growth in our loan portfolios continues to focus on our core business growth of key relationships and expanding our engagement with familiar customer segments our experienced team continues to adhere to a disciplined underwriting culture and a proactive approach to portfolio management that we have solidified over the past plus years when the bank worked to derisk the portfolio we remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects elevated inflation supply chain disruption labor cost to name just a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including the ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bankwide going forward we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk grades economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality finally on slide andy discussed previously that our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past several years as weve built a diverse portfolio of highquality commercial loans across the bank and a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolio while cre has frequently been cited as an area of risk in the media our approach to cre lending reflects the conservative approach weve applied across the bank in building our cre portfolio we focused on partnering associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 with wellknown developers in stable midwest markets over twothirds of our cre portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties office loans represent just of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio we are weighted towards suburban class a properties while we continue to monitor this portfolio closely we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach and the markets we operate in with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat id like to reiterate a couple points from the presentation on slide first based on the resiliency of our markets and the ongoing momentum with our lending initiatives we remain confident in our ability to drive highquality loan growth throughout the year as such we continue to expect total periodend loan growth of between and in secondly while we see that our core deposits have stabilized we now expect core customer deposits to shrink by for the year well with that said we also remain confident in our initiatives on the deposit side based on several leading indicators that point to momentum in the back half of the year with this in mind we expect to see positive core customer deposit growth of in the second half of the year shifting to revenue weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action following unique events of the spring we now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between and in and finally we continue to invest strategically in both people and technology but our disciplined approach to expenses remains foundational we also remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage as a company as a result weve lowered our expense guidance to between and growth for the year so with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will be now conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc i guess first just on the funding side i think i heard you say this i think it was andy that the wholesale and network transaction deposits are expected to be stable in the back half of the year just correct if im wrong in that but i was just hoping to get kind of a sense into if thats wrong expectation for how that how those were fluctuated its just if theres a loan to deposit target that youre hoping to keep or if theres the levels that you dont want to go above related to those funding sources and then just kind of trends within the second quarter in terms of the core deposits that gave you confidence in being able to grow in the back half of the year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah maybe ill start that one out and then turn it over to derek one of our absolute imperatives in the second quarter is to ensure that we had a strong liquidity position which we do so we wanted to make sure that our day one liquidity position was in a good place for the bank in an uncertain time since that period of time weve been able to see that our uninsured uncollateralized deposits are down to weve seen that we have day one coverage of well over and weve seen we have seen the stability of our deposit base emerge in the monthbymonth as weve come through this whatever you want to call this fourmonth period of time we just came through with regards to loan to deposit ratio because we know that we have a stability in our deposit base right now weve stated that we wanted to be in the to range because we took a bit of a conservative approach in my opinion an appropriate approach to liquidity we actually lowered our loan to deposit ratio in the second quarter and so were well within the range we dont have to add to that on the high cost deposit front in order to maintain it and to me theres a finally an emergence of a deposit trend that we think we have a much better view into as we head into the second half of the year derek do you want to take any of the rest of that derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think only the way to connect the dots on the guidance and what andy just shared is if we got to loan growth for the year and weve gotten a little over from that since december already you could see associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 us consuming that customer deposit growth in the back half of the year to fund the low end of our range i think if we had good quality lending relationships we wouldnt rule out adding to that funding with additional wholesale i think the point we want to make though is that weve seen stability at the back half of the quarter and our core customer deposits and were confident about being able to grow that and that the impact that weve seen on our margin from the disruption is largely behind us daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay right i appreciate all that color i guess as we think about the nii guidance that you gave typically kind of thinking about that from a margin perspective and this relates to nii as well but just curious to get your thoughts on maybe the cadence of the margin over the next few quarters just your thoughts on when that might bottom and a clarification within that i may have misheard you but i thought you said youre assuming a rate hike in september is was that supposed to be july or so just those things with a quick clarification thanks derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so the when we did our forecast rates had were a little bit softer and we did assume a september increase thats moved forward a little bit we do think again as i just stated most of our margin pressure is behind us our outlook and our nii guidance for the rest of year contemplates a margin in the range of to so we think that stabilization is helpful and thats not what our outlook suggests andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp id just expand on that daniel by saying we think well support a big portion of loan growth in the second half with the deposit growth that were going to have we are asset sensitive and expect that we will have some benefit to the rate increase and we can pretty clearly see what that will be on the deposit side there could be some modest deposit mix shift continue and for the rest of the year and if we need to get any wholesale funding well factor that in so when we believe that we wont call the very bottom on margin i think that would be too bold but we definitely see a more clear path right now than we saw days ago and barring any extraordinary industrywide news that weve had each of the first two quarters of the year we do think that were in the range of the bottom daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and just lastly just related to that the on the rate hike date if we do get it in july as the ph the feeders are expecting here rather than september would you think it would have much impact on the guidance maybe push you a little bit towards the higher end of the range im sorry the lower end of the range for nii derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i dont think weve ever our level of precision is that high part of our nii guidance includes rate of growth on the earning assets so it could be helpful but i dont think the resolution is that high associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thank you for taking all my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey thanks its just following up on the funding i guess first when derek when you said the margin to is that your view for the full year or is that for the second half of the year derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thats for the second half of the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then when we look at the funding outlook its good to hear that you feel encouraged that theres opportunity for growth i guess whats driving that optimism for consumer deposit growth is it just you can put a rate out there and that will attract money or is this a more full relationship i guess as we look at that growth is that all going to come in the form of cds or do you think that theres opportunity to attract relationships and should we think that the dda level has sort of fund the core here as a percentage of deposits andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah all good questions and its not a one thing for us we started as you know several prongs to this i would focus on mobile satisfaction we know its the most visited site we have and so when you increase your satisfaction there what you look for immediately is a decrease in attrition weve seen a doubledigit of decrease in attrition and by the way thats during a very volatile second quarter so thats one indicator of what weve had weve seen growth in our customer base on consumer and business each of the last three months we have seen a growth in our core commercial outside of government banking the government banking dollars that weve seen run off have typically been collateralized low margin deals and thats over million we had an extraordinary one customer take million that was a higher yielding customer but when you put those two things together those we believe are extraordinary events that frankly we arent in a position to incur and thats why weve seen that stability happen in may and june we see it halfway through the month of july as well and so when you pair customer satisfaction when you pair that with customer growth you do expect to get operating accounts with that we are getting better and better at deepening relationships on the commercial side that will be important for us the rest of this year next year and the following year if we want to add to those categories which we may we associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 know how to deepen relationships now and that will give us confidence on the go forward so the answer is no it wont be all cds we are subject to the mix shift thats occurring in the marketplace but we can see very clearly that that mix shift has slowed in the last two months and so we expect that to temper a bit each of the subsequent months as the year goes along jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay so then when we look at dda as a percentage of total here of what is this a floor or do you think we could still see that go lower from here andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i couldnt call that a floor but i absolutely do not believe youll see the pace that you saw in the previous two quarters jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as we look out a little further into and when some of these broker deposits come due do you feel that the momentum that you just described earlier will be enough to be able to replace those with home grown deposits or we should be thinking that brokered cd levels stay at these levels for more of an indefinite period of time derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think its going to depend both on how much we want to grow the balance sheet and what the business mix is of the assets that were putting on because we think we still have continued opportunity to optimize our yields that way i would not expect that as a percent of our balance sheet to grow disproportionately so we do expect that the consumer side of the business will provide significant funding and so the mix would be the same or decrease from where it is now jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally for me in the past you talked about the optionality of the auto program being able to sort of ramp that up and ramp it down and you had growth this quarter would that be a lever you would use to offset either better than expected deposit flows or weaker than expected deposit flows or is that sort of the place you should be looking at and making up slack or giving some opportunity andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp were not going to double down on auto and increase that rate to the point that it becomes too heavily concentrated however the idea all along is that we could decrease our reliance on thirdparty originated mortgages which are have a less significant yield and are a nonrelationship play were seeing very good yields on the auto book as were going along right now theyre also not one thats likely to refinance if you see rates go down in months so that puts us in a pretty decent position as well what you will see from us so i see those two as a bit of a tradeoff the thirdparty originated mortgages and auto over time then weve got to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 we will dissect the balance sheet and look at expanding businesses that weve had some success in we will look at that right now and come up with a plan heading into yearend on that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co afternoon everybody thanks for taking the question i guess i wanted to go back to the nii discussion for just a second it sounds like a little bit more margin erosion but at a much slower pace than certainly this quarter i guess even if the margin hasnt bottomed i think the updated guidance implies that the second half nii will have to average something around million or so higher than the second quarter run rate so i guess what youre saying is that theres enough loan or any asset growth overall to overwhelm any further margin erosion so is the right conclusion that the second quarter was that we just witnessed the trough for nii derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think well leave that i think if you do the math if thats what youre coming up with well let it at that i think weve got a range of growth on the asset side that is pretty good and if we think that comes in lighter then weve got options to be more efficient on the funding side scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and then andy just wanted to discuss i guess in a bit more detail just sort of the tactical thinking on your appetite to lend your biggest competitors presumably theyre going to be subject to this whole host of new capital and liquidity rules so the biggest guys seem to be pulling back on lending are there any areas where you guys similarly are pulling back in light of economic uncertainty or by i know you touched on a little in your opening remarks in specific areas but by contrast with the larger banks pulling back any areas where you think you can take some market share if the pricing is good and your competitors are pulling back andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah thats a good question you asked two different questions within there i think scott i think one was with regards to capital and i think you mentioned economic uncertainty what i would take first is the economic uncertainty and tell you that we want to lend to people that can pay us back and i know that sounds pretty basic but when you look at almost of our auto book being prime and super prime on the origination side when you see the loan to value go down and the fico go modestly up even above around i believe in the last quarter we are looking at a pretty squeaky clean book but in that place theres some people that have pulled back there associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 we are dealing with prime super prime borrowers and were getting a yield above so this seems like a pretty good move for us so id say thats exactly what is happening in that area we looked at our thirdparty originated mortgages and in the markets that were in the yield were getting was substantially less than that and our history has been that that book churns when rates go down they immediately go down with it and so that would be one example of an area that we will see over time that shift will be beneficial to us were going to focus heavily on relationship businesses we are now proving within our commercial book that we can grow our core commercial deposits that will matter a great deal to us over time we havent broken that out publicly but i see the trends on that and in this year when youre positive in that space youre on to something so we will continue to try to look at that as a source for us to look at lower cost deposits lower than wholesale funded lower than fhlbfunded lower than government high rate government deposits so there are a few areas that are emerging for us because weve gotten into assetbased lending equipment finance and enhanced our commercial approach to business and then finally id say just acquiring customers through visàvis digital and mobile banking were seeing the percentage of customers coming through on our brand advertising campaign through digital increasing they are modest in incremental numbers because were testing and learning and making sure theyre not falling off on the back side so its a lot of the things that weve talked about and the answer is yes we do believe that we have opportunities in the marketplace that being said we dont expect anything like the growth that we saw in previous in the previous year and but that was by design to increase your capabilities so that you can continue to land in the higher return areas as you deemphasize some of the lower return areas with regards to capital we feel like were in a pretty good position as we create that shift in what were lending on that of course you increase your capital visàvis profitability and right now we dont see a constraint on capital based on the way that were approaching it deemphasizing some lower yield emphasizing some higher yield so we do think and with regards to regulatory were early innings weve heard quotes from the occ and seen those out there and seen that they thought it probably would be a big emphasis on the over billion banks but its a little too early to comment i think on what thats going to mean to the banks above us in size scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good appreciate the thoughts thank you very much andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you scott operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc the forward curve is implying lower rates next year so as i look at your billion of brokered cds and other time deposits whats the repricing opportunity over the next kind of or within with the assumption that rates are lower do you have a schedule a maturity schedule on when those roll derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah we dont but let me give you some color all of our brokered cd programs were largely within months so think of 12month term as the outside limit and then we scheduled both depending on price and volume and appetite either nine months six months or shorter than that and we start out very short indiscernible and then if you think about our specials for retail its largely centered on the sevenmonth cd so we had a couple other maturities but our most popular that weve been with the last couple months is seven months so we think of most of this all repricing between now and mid next year the majority of it terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and can you remind me the network transaction deposits thats beta product derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe last question i dont want to overlook slide andy when you talked about the net growth and some of the deposit products maybe can you talk about on the consumer side are you getting are you the primary bank in this relationship how are average deposits looking and maybe expand a little bit on these new businesses and households that are partnering with associated andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so ill give the example of the mass affluent the mass affluent is a segment where a large percentage of the deposits reside and so i mean that is a primary deepening play within those within your existing customer base but then its also with new accounts that come in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 so when you look at that category for us what id seen coming into the bank was that we had an opportunity to deepen on the mass affluent side we had an opportunity to deepen on the commercial side i would say that those efforts are just happening right now now it was almost impossible to see that in the second quarter of this year because of the extraordinary events that we had which is exactly why i created page because we see the trends behind the trends as the dust settles as the noise goes away so the idea on these is absolutely get activity coming into your bank but with that activity put products and services in there and give your people an opportunity to talk about that on the consumer side thats what segmentation does on the consumer side on the commercial side it is simple things like tracking of your pipeline and incenting for your pipeline and our people have gotten better and better at that conversation in fact i see the early indicator i saw the early indicator days ago in our treasury management sales that is not where youll make or break the bank from a revenue standpoint but its an indication that youre having conversations on things that matter to the customer with regards their liquidity and when you have those conversations youre typically able to deepen weve seen that deepening follow from that the other question comes up do you want customer growth or do you want deposit growth and the answer we have here is yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you andy andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good afternoon guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey a couple of followups and another i guess separate question but why is attrition down just following up on terrys comments about indiscernible why is attrition down and why are people not leaving andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 yeah thats a great question people stay for a lot of different reasons its great when youre nice its also great when youre nice its really nice when you actually have a digital experience which is the most used channel and then its really good when you have products and services they want and need and they start to deepen and so when we launched our new digital platform you always take a step back in satisfaction its just annoying to change but weve rebounded from that really quickly in my experience it usually takes six months we started to see rebounding in days that was awesome so once we did that were starting to get back to our previous levels but then people actually use it and they liked it and so when they like it we saw our brand satisfaction going up with the mass affluent the mass affluent lets us speak to people in a language and what matters to you when they answer that we match them up with the product or service they leave satisfied they dont walk out the door your first year attrition improves when you get most of your people dealing with the channel they like and by the way weve had uptime on our digital channel since we launched it weve not been down this is what we promised when we went to this cloudbased solution and weve delivered on that the number one thing somebody wants is when they pull out their phone and they log in they want to see their balance and they do not want the system to be down weve delivered that so as theyre more satisfied we havent given them as many reasons to leave or weve given them more reasons to stay so thats a pretty encouraging view on our side jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good slide you show some strong commercial growth from my point of view youre also talking about pipeline slowing a little bit but it looks pretty good to me i guess i dont know if its for you or pat but whats going on with your core commercial clients and whats driving that general commercial growth andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp do you want to take that pat patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp sure i think its largely what andys focused on we spent last year beefing up adding rms and helping to really focus on where were going to what our key relationships are and our core client profile is to an earlier point were not out chasing business in stretching we havent changed our credit box so its just a matter of getting more people on the street talking to the clients we want to bank and its really kind of helped to generate and while the pipeline is down its still pretty solid opportunities that were seeing andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well just to expand on that as well this is andy weve spoken to the quality of the rm and the fact that wed gotten them from almost every major competitor in the footprint but the proofs in the pudding and so now when you see treasury management sales up and you see pipelines continuing to grow the business then when you see your commercial deposits going up we believe weve hired some really talented rms and frankly we had some talented rms inhouse as well and so weve married those two and its put us on a pretty good path associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then last one for you pat slide on credit i agree the numbers look very tame but more curious what youre seeing in consumer credit and any themes and anything youre watching in consumer its a little tick up in nonaccrual but de minimis but what are you seeing and what are you watching patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp we continue to watch delinquencies we continue to watch payment trends and to be honest weve seen everything really remain flat and improve in some spots our residential arm portfolio continues to improve from a delinquency standpoint as andy mentioned the indirect auto has done great credit card book really were still trending positive there relative to prepandemic so from a consumer standpoint weve been really happy with the production there but i think its a reflection of that prime and super prime focus jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp just a quick piggyback on that i mean just the unemployment rate in the state of wisconsin is people are working and when they work they typically pay especially if theyre prime and super prime customers so we watched closely the unemployment figures and delinquencies and the delinquency on page actually shows a little bump up but what it doesnt speak to is that we had on a syndicated credit on the upstream there was an administrative mix up or slip or slowdown that stopped payment from coming to us that accounted for about basis points and so thats already been rectified in july so essentially our delinquencies are flat jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful thank you very much guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brody preston with ubs please proceed with your question brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone thanks for taking the questions just a followup just on what you just mentioned on that syndicated credit was that what drove the increase in the commercial and business lending nonaccruals as well or is that something different associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp not that one particular situation the situation andy just talked about was just tied to the delinquency the non accrual that was actually one other deal its a oneoff transaction that we recognized in the quarter were not seeing anything from a trend standpoint in the commercial book that would lead us to any other concerns going into  brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i did want to follow up on the million of mass affluent deposit growth i just wanted to ask you if you had a sense for kind of what deposit categories that growth went into you had good customer cd growth so i just want to know if it was kind of like leading with cds or anything any detail you can give us there andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i dont have the immediate break out but since a lot of it came from existing customers that had checking accounts its going to be an interestbearing deposit accounts and the money that came in so whether that is money market savings or cd it would be largely in those categories brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i did want to followup and maybe just ask again on scotts question from earlier on the nii guidance i mean just the math would dictate that if i take the low end of your nii guide it implies that youd need to earn million in nii in the back half of the year which is about million to million per quarter just doing the simple math and so it implies a stepup but the margin it doesnt sound like were going to call a bottom the nibs were not willing to say that they wont go down anymore i guess im struggling with the nii guidance just a little bit in light of those two issues so any additional color you could provide around maybe the average earning asset base thats in your assumption or what could actually cause the back half of the year to exhibit the growth you need to hit the low end of the guidance would really be appreciated derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes looking at the its the to earning asset growth that we talked about and then margins similar to what weve been looking at brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and maybe could i just ask on the auto and maybe the indirect cre maybe talk to me a little bit about like the funding that loan growth and like what the incremental spread looks like it sounds like youre getting pretty good loan yields on the auto but just given that they dont come with those two categories historically havent really come with much in the way of deposits just wanted to kind of get a sense for how youre funding that and what the incremental spread looks like when you do fund that loan associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp do you want to speak to that derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp well yeah i can speak to that generally speaking our incremental rate we dont fund one loan at a time and one deposit at a time so our marginal deposit growth rates have been between and and the auto book that were talking about is generally getting spreads and then youre getting to on your variable rate ci loans and so thats what our outlook is based on and then the performance of the back book and the pay down on fixed rate securities and auto loans a couple years ago was much lower rates andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp im not sure how to speak to this because new originated cre is not a huge number right now but what i would say is were getting a very good margin on the deals that were doing on cre brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and then theres the last one on capital the credit metrics are totally benign here and i understand that i just wanted to ask like when you do comp yourself against your peer group the cet1 is lower than i think where the peer group is its probably justifiable based on the credit outlook on your credit metrics but is there any thought given to maybe being closer to the middle of the pack and having a 10plus percent cet1 range moving forward just to maybe give investors or whoever more comfort around capital derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah what weve got in there now is the same range we had beginning of the year it doesnt prohibit us from being higher than that but if loan growth is at the higher end of what weve expected to then thats where we could come in if a loan growth is less than that we would accrue above that cet1 range that weve got outlined in there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp said another way we have loan growth we would expect to be higher than that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you very much for taking the questions everyone i appreciate it andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you brody operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks maybe asking the prior question a little bit different you talked about growing the company and obviously thats the right strategy over time with your stock at tangible book is there a scenario where you would consider shrinking additional noncore assets and buying back your stocks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp that wont be my priority in the immediate future chris we have opportunity when you have lowyielding assets on the books and you have initiatives that are working that produce higher yielding assets thats the number one way over time to return to the shareholder and so that will be the plan if we see that that growth is not there and we have opportunity to use our capital in a different way we do have dollars set aside for stock repurchase but that would not be my intent for the rest of christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you and then derek i think you said its that was a cycletodate beta i want to make sure i heard that right and also what the updated thoughts there for full cycle i may have missed it derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah you did hear that right and wed expect to be in the high for the full cycle christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 operator
