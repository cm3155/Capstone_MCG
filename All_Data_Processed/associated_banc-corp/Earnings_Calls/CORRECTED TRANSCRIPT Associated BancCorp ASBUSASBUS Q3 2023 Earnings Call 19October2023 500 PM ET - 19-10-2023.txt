asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call im andy harmening i am joined once again by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer i will start today by sharing some highlights for the quarter from there derek will provide an update on margin income capital trends and then pat will share an update on credit now i mentioned back in july that we were starting to see renewed stability after a volatile spring and what we saw here at associated in the third quarter was a definitive continuation of those stabilizing trends employment trends remain very strong in our footprint with most midwestern states seen unemployment below the national average and wisconsin coming in below our prime and super prime retail customers remain resilient in the face of macro uncertainty what this means for us is that weve been able to focus squarely on execution of our initiatives as we look to attract and deepen customer relationships optimize our balance sheet and improve our profitability profile these initiatives have clearly taken hold in the face of challenging operating environments on the asset side weve steadily added highquality consumer and commercial loan balances that enable us to rely less heavily on lower yielding nonrelationship balances on the funding side the customer acquisition and attrition trends we shared for  look even stronger in  initiatives such as our new mass affluent strategy product enhancements and brand campaign are clearly having an impact and that led to million in core customer deposit growth during the third quarter this not only helps us fund our loan growth but it enables us to decrease our reliance on wholesale and network funding sources now and in the future and finally on the digital side weve regularly upgraded our online and mobile experiences since we launched our new platform a year ago these changes have contributed significantly to higher customer satisfaction scores and decreased customer attrition and while weve continued to get traction since launching phase of our strategic plan a little bit over two years ago we havent lost sight of what got us here in the first place our foundational discipline on credit quality and expense management as the banking environment continues to evolve in the coming quarters that discipline is going to remain front and center for us its also important that were thoughtful about what comes next for associated bank as we look to set the bank up for longterm success thats why our team is working hard putting the finishing touches on phase of our strategic plan which we look forward to sharing in more detail later this quarter with that id like to highlight our results for the third quarter on slide our third quarter results reflected the steady growth of our balance sheet and continued progress against our initiatives as mentioned in the past our stated goal is to fund the majority of our growth with core customer deposits we grew these deposits meaningfully in and after a period of industrywide volatility in the first half of this year core customer deposits grew by over million here in  as we continued to realize the impacts of our customer acquisition and relationship deepening initiatives this enabled us to pay down highcost noncustomer funding sources like brokered cds during the quarter on the loan side all three of our major consumer and commercial loan segments once again saw net balanced growth during the quarter led by growth in our auto finance business with that said its clear that lending activity has slowed in most categories as compared to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 shifting to the income statement funding costs continued to be a pressure point for the entire industry in this rate environment here at associated however the pace of downward pressure on margin has slowed in  our nim decreased by basis points to for the third quarter we saw a slight increase in our noninterest income our third quarter noninterest income grew by versus the prior quarter partially offsetting the ongoing pressure on nii and as always were continuing to monitor asset quality closely our net chargeoff ratio came in at basis points for the quarter as we added another million in provision and held our acll ratio flat at while several key credit metrics have ticked up slightly compared to the prior quarter we considered the data to be consistent with a gradual normalization to precovid performance levels we have not seen anything to suggest trouble on the horizon for specific industry or geography on slide we highlight our deposit trends for the third quarter as you know industrywide volatility in the spring combined with an ongoing battle for deposits to create significant funding headwinds for the first half of the year while much of the volatility cleared up by june shortterm funding and liquidity pressures combined with the mix shift in customer accounts had a lingering impact on  balance flows we continued to see some impact from mix shift during the quarter but the situation is largely stabilized providing a clearer view of the impacts from our deposit gathering initiatives that started to take hold in during the quarter we saw net growth in both consumer and commercial balances and core customer deposits as a whole grew by million or this growth enabled us to decrease our reliance on higher cost network and brokered deposits which decreased by million or during the quarter as a reminder our strategy is to fund our loan growth primarily with customer deposits we expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in check as we move through the remainder of the year and into and we remain confident in our ability to fund our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our initiatives based on yeartodate trends and current market conditions were affirming our guidance and continue to expect total core customer deposits to decrease by for but increase by in the back half of the year on slide you can see that the deposit growth hasnt come by accident as weve discussed previously our team has been hard at work to enhance our offerings with an eye towards attracting new relationships deepening existing relationships and increasing retention its clear at this point our initiatives have taken hold since we focused on upgrading product and service offerings and have promoted these new offerings with a customer centric brand strategy as of the third quarter our consumer household acquisition rate was up versus the same period a year ago and our attrition rate was down digital has also been instrumental to our success and through the open architecture of our new platform weve been able to move more quickly to deploy upgrades and enhancements to make our customers lives easier in a little more than a year since the platform launched weve had uptime and have already made customerfacing upgrades leading to a multiyear high in customer satisfaction scores and finally since launching a new mass affluent strategy to deepen relationships with high potential customers weve already added over million in net new deposits nearly doubling our full year goal by september this growth represents a roughly increase in our prelaunched baseline associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 so as weve said our plan is to fund our loan growth with core customer relationships deposit relationships and weve steadily continued to execute this plan in the face of a challenging funding environment as a result were bringing in new dollars and deepening relationships with a customer base that is more satisfied shifting to slide weve steadily added highquality loan balances to our portfolio with another million added here in the third quarter this marks the six consecutive quarters in which all three of our major loan segments have reported net growth while growth has continued throughout the year the pace of growth has slowed and its clear that pipelines have also slowed as customers make a more cautious approach in what appears to be a higher for longer rate environment during the third quarter we again saw moderate growth in our auto finance portfolio where we continued to focus squarely on prime and super prime clientele as a reminder we do not intend to become disproportionately reliant on auto loans but the portfolio continues to provide us a highquality yieldfriendly option to diversify our consumer loan book away from lower yielding nonrelationship assets such as thirdparty originated mortgage on the commercial side our mortgage warehouse business led the way during  but thats not something we would expect to become a theme looking forward its clear that the lending environment has begun to slow for the industry but we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes relationships quality and diversification while delivering accretive returns this enables us to deemphasize lower yielding nonrelationship asset classes over time given the slowdown in the lending environment we now expect total loan growth of between and for so finally on slide our team once again paired solid revenues with diligent expense management during the third quarter given the funding pressures facing the industry our ptpp income dipped to million or million lower than the second quarter but despite these funding pressures our yeartodate ptpp income is million higher in than it was in a increase with that ill hand it over to derek meyer our chief financial officer to provide further detail on our margin income statement and capital trends for the quarter derek derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy ill start by highlighting our asset and liability rate trends during the third quarter on slide our total asset yields have continued to rise due to rising rates and the repricing nature of a large segment of our loan book since the start of the rate cycle total earning asset yields have increased by basis points or roughly of the increase of fed funds target rate over the same period commercial and cre yields have grown the most as we continue to add new loans and categories such as assetbased lending and equipment finance while our floating rate back book continues to reprice higher on the liabilities side rising rates liquidity pressures and a mix shift in customer deposits have converged to create significant funding cost pressure for the whole industry while these pressures have stabilized meaningfully in  they continue to pose a challenge for profitability in the nearterm here at associated interestbearing liability costs have now increased by basis points since the fourth quarter of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 specific to deposit betas the scurve we were planning to see in the rising rate environment has largely played out as expected but the shape of the curve has steepened meaningfully in amid the funding cost pressures described previously as such our interestbearing deposit beta has now climbed to roughly since the start of the rate cycle moving to slide the funding cost pressures facing the industry combined to drive a 9basis point compression in our nim in  while pressures remain we view this trend as a clear sign of stabilization compared to margin trends in the first half of the year this stabilization was also demonstrated by our dollar net interest income which decreased by just million after significant pressure in  and  as weve mentioned previously however were not relying solely on the rate environment to dictate our earnings going forward we benefited from a natural asset sensitivity over the past couple of years as rates have risen but weve also taken actions on both sides of the balance sheet to decrease our sensitivity and drive more durable interest income in future quarters whether its adding highquality customer loans core customer deposits or layering in interest rate hedges these actions have been designed to provide our company with additional flexibility to maintain our performance through the cycle as a reminder we do not intend to call the peak on the interest rate environment in the nearterm but we will continue to take reasonable steps over time to manage our asset sensitivity and downside rate risk as you can see on the righthand side of this slide these efforts have gradually decreased our asset sensitivity over the past several quarters we expect to continue benefiting in a rising rate or higher for longer scenario but were also better positioned for an eventual decrease in rates over time the macro outlook remains uncertain but based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we now expect net interest income growth of between and in on slide we continued to manage our securities book in the third quarter to remain within our to target since the third quarter of the yield on our securities book has risen by basis points but we continue to rein in our durations to reduce our longer term rate risk after adjusting our cet1 capital ratio to include the impacts of aoci this impact would have represented basis point hit to cet1 in the third quarter this impact is up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by the rebound in rates as a percentage of total assets our investment security and cash positions were maintained to roughly for the second straight quarter we continue to target investments to total assets of between and in on slide we highlight our noninterest income trends despite the downward pressure from marketdriven headwinds and adjustments to our fee structure noninterest income grew modestly for the third straight quarter and landed at million the primary factors for the quarteroverquarter increase were million increase in asset gains and modest increases in service charges and deposit account fees and wealth management fees with that said we continue to expect total noninterest income to contract by between and versus as a reminder this anticipated compression is driven by current market dynamics and moderation in deposit account fee income due to ph od nsf changes we made in the back half of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 moving to slide our third quarter expenses increased by versus the prior quarter but were flat with the same period a year ago we continue to make targeted investments in people and technology to support our initiatives our fte efficiency ratio rose to during the quarter but it remains basis points below lower than the same period a year ago additionally our noninterest expense base has remained below as a percent of average assets and is now down basis points from the same period last year while we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations in we are committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth over the longterm on an ongoing basis we will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize our expense base where possible with that in mind we expect total noninterest expense growth of between and in but would note that this number excludes the impact of any nonrecurring items incurred in the fourth quarter such as fdics special assessment shifting to slide we continue to prioritize paying a competitive dividend and funding organic growth while managing capital levels towards the target ranges during the third quarter our capital ratios grew versus the prior quarter and versus year end we remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look out over the remainder of the year given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm rates to remain elevated in the nearterm we continue to expect tce to land in the to range by year end weve increased the upper end of our cet1 target range and are now targeting a range of to ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start on slide with an update on our allowance trends we utilized the moodys august baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment the baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive gdp growth rates a cooling labor market and a continued deceleration of inflation our acll increased by million during the quarter to million our allowance continues to be driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our midwest footprint accordingly our reserves to loans ratio remained flat to the prior quarter and basis points higher than the same period a year ago at moving to slide our quarterly credit trends remained relatively stable across the portfolio during the third quarter with migration reflecting a broadbased normalization in portfolio performance we did see moderate increases in nonaccrual loans delinquencies and chargeoffs during the third quarter but as previously discussed we anticipated these shifts as a sign of normalization back to prepandemic levels as opposed to an indication of broader issues in the portfolio as andy mentioned we have not seen anything to suggest a pattern of credit stress in a specific industry or geography we added another million in provision during the third quarter which matches our second quarter provision build and is consistent with the past four quarters as mentioned this provision build was largely a function of loan growth limited credit movement and macro trends associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 we remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty of the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor cost to name just a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bankwide going forward we expect any provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes to risk grades economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality on slide i remind you that our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past several years as weve built a diverse portfolio of highquality commercial loans and a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolio while cre has been cited as an area of risk in the media over the past several quarters we feel wellpositioned given the conservative approach weve applied across the bank in building our cre portfolio we focused on partnering with wellknown developers in stable midwest markets over twothirds of our portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties office loans represent just of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio we are weighted towards suburban class a properties while we feel wellpositioned given our business model approach and the markets we operate in we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you id like to close out by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide first weve set ourselves up to drive quality relationshipfocused loan growth that decreases our reliance on lower yielding nonrelationship balances and enhances our profitability profile however given the recent slowdown in the lending environment we now expect the total loan growth of between and in second the deposit environment has clearly stabilized following a volatile first half of the year the stabilized environment combined with our deposit initiatives drove strong core customer deposit growth in the third quarter with that said were leaving our guidance unchanged for the full year given the seasonality we typically see in balance flows as we approach year end shifting to revenue weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and rate environment we now expect to deliver net interest income growth between and in and lastly our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our company as such were maintaining our noninterest expense guidance for the year but would note that this guidance excludes nonrecurring items incurred in  such as the fdics special assessment with that lets open up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good afternoon everybody andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey danny daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe first just on the nonaccruals the increase in ci i know you mentioned there was not really a pattern to that increase but if its just a normalization of credit costs just curious how youre thinking about what we should or how we should be thinking about what normalization of net chargeoffs or even provision could look like thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i would say in terms of net chargeoffs we saw a little bit of a spike this quarter but i think last quarter was probably a little more normal than what we saw this quarter i think these are just a handful of things i think non accruals could be going forward were going to watch as credits normalize back where they settle at its hard to say right now and for provision were probably pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters and i would expect similar pattern daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then looking at the loan growth im just curious what thought is in terms of future loan growth where that might come from and then if you could touch on where new loan yields are for those categories itd be helpful derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah this is derek so obviously the auto has been pretty steady and we expect that to continue we havent moved the credit box its getting bigger so you would normally expect the rate of growth to drop but we also expanded into our footprint states and so the dollar increases are steady i think this quarter like most quarters we expected balanced growth so we would have in our prior guidance that we just took down expected similar growth in ci and while we continue to have more new names this year and grow that yearoveryear because of our indiscernible we saw the back of our pipeline not associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 replenish and pull through into additional fundings at the pace we saw earlier in the year and so that has pulled through in our guidance and then well think about how we position that for next year when we give our guidance we really havent been sharing our new production yields so i wont go there but thats how things are materializing andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp but ill say daniel this is andy with regards to portfolio growth its important to know where youre growing and where youre not and where were not growing is on the thirdparty originated mortgages and that by far has been the lowest yielding portfolio that we have so when we stopped the origination of that portfolio which in its peak i believe in was just around a billion in production than a billion and then we shut it down so basically youll see a runoff on the balance sheet or a decrease in that category which means that our residential real estate most likely wont grow at the pace of the market we believe that over time well be able to replace that with quality ci business today clearly cre is a very stable low to no growth category although paydowns have been a little bit slow so i think over time youll see that in the ci with regards to fourth quarter numbers we just took a hard look at our pipeline and we also took a hard look at relationships that may not have before relationships and so we wont extend or be aggressive in those that are lower yielding and those that are not full relationships and usually those are tied together so thats a little bit of the reason that weve adjusted the year end forecast on full growth daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just lastly a highlevel question you touched on thirdparty origination mortgages but i guess just for that asset class overall have you thought about or would it is there a way that it might make sense to sell perhaps some of those loans to kind of reset the margin to a certain extent or is there a breakeven point or a place where rates could get to where that could be more attractive andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i mean dan you know its been a pretty interesting market the last six months and so over that period of time weve looked at every loan category weve looked at every security weve looked at tranches of tranches and what i would say is we know our portfolio as well as we could know it right now if there comes a time when theres an opportunity in one of those tranches well be prepared for that right now were not prepared to speak to that daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you for all the color andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey looking at slide and i dont know if this is derek or andy but it can you talk about just the cadence of when you think your margin might bottom out i mean when i look at slides and slide it sure seems like some of the pressure on interestbearing liabilities is starting to fade a little bit and youre getting the asset repricing but would you guys say were at or near a bottom on your margin andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well jon its a good question i can tell you i feel a lot more certainty than i did on march when we look at the last few months its been pretty interesting the one encouraging sign several encouraging signs i would say is weve seen a decrease i talked about the decrease in attrition that weve experienced that helps us understand what the volatility is going to be weve seen a i think were pretty near the bottom on our noninterestbearing deposit percentage we dont see it going down significantly from where it is and that slowdown that we saw this quarter we actually expect it to slow down again in the fourth quarter and thats why we have confidence that were getting near the bottom we think knowing that that noninterestbearing is where it is then the question becomes what is your asset growth what can you put on at higher yields and thats what is to be determined what the market will allow we wont force it were not going to force growth for growths sake as we go into the end of this year and the beginning of next year but we think there will be some modest growth out there for us when you put that in at higher yields that of course takes the place of what creates less pressure on that margin so we expect the margin pressure to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter we do believe that in we will see an inflection point in there of course its based on multiple variables but the number one positive that i see right now is hitting a terminal number or getting close to the terminal number on noninterestbearing deposits jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah indiscernible from my standpoint jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 okay thats helpful though slide on the customer cds versus brokered cds can you talk a little bit about what you did there and how you attracted the customer cd balances and should we expect more of that in the next couple of quarters derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah our customers cd balances have been largely the same rates for quite some time i think even towards the end of the last quarter and in fact now were toying with the idea of dropping the promo rates a little bit this quarter to see if we can continue to hold it sounds like were getting some interference but to see if we can continue to hold the production so that strategy has worked well and weve stayed fairly short most of our production all along this year has been in the seven months cd and in fact really thats about the only story there the brokered cds weve stayed short all along when we first went into them after silicon valley we mostly went into three months with for almost everything and then as things progressed and we wanted to make sure we had secured funding coverage that grew a little bit more and then we just spread out the maturity buckets so that we dont have a large lump anywhere and then as we get exiting our shortterm deposit growth or longterm deposit growth we have the option each month and whether you want to roll over a piece or just pay it down and that was very helpful this quarter obviously andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and so ill maybe expand on that even a little bit jon you started with how weve attracted customers in cds and i would even stop that question shorter and say how we attracted customers and when i look at one thing that gives me confidence heading into is we have made purposeful actions towards product marketing digital in our approach to business what were seeing is we are reversing literally in the process of reversing a multiyear trend on customer growth and its going in the right direction and weve reversed that trend and what many would argue is one of the most volatile years weve had for regional banks in the past decade so when we look at that those customers when you marry that customer growth with customer deepening tactics whether that goes into a cd whether that is managing the back end tranche of a cd or whether that goes into a money market whether it goes in the noninterestbearing theres no doubt that when you have customer growth you create a tailwind for yourselves so in a market that is normalizing to some extent weve put ourselves through the initiatives weve had in a pretty good position on the foundational customer growth jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and helpful and then just last thing andy i travel a lot and im trying to look at my calendar but when do we expect the timing on the big reveal of phase and is this strategic quantitative or both what can we expect when you give us the phase andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i was a little nervous that youre going to ask me to predict the future of the packers here in the fourth quarter when you did that lead in were putting that together right now jon its not long i mean were nearing the end of october going into november we will be in the fourth quarter just as fast as we can put the right accurate associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 presentation together so its been something weve been working on for a little bit but it will be later in the fourth quarter exact times shared in the near future jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay strategic and quantitative both is that what we can expect andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp with regards to the plan of course it will be strategic we will give indication of what key metrics are going to happen on the financial side jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good all right thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp we dont want to put every number into your model jon itd put a lot of pressure on us jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc no im waiting im just still waiting thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i guess i wanted to take another stab on the nii so it looks like theres a fairly wide range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter anywhere from down just a bit to actually up several percentage points i guess just sort of in your view what would have to happen for nii to have bottomed out at the current level i know there must be some confidence that it may have bottomed out or could even go higher i mean what are sort of the puts and takes as you sort of think about that range of outcomes derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so the way things look right now scott this is derek the rate of noninterestbearing dda runoff and the impact that had on our margin abated considerably that was really a bigger story in  and  and so you still got a fair amount of low cost deposits moving into higher cost deposit products that was probably a little stronger than we thought associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 for things to bottom out you really need to get to a spot and this is where most of the longer range scenarios start to look like for us even with a few rate cuts next year where loans continue to reprice weve got a big fixed rate book and those as the old ones reprice into paydown and new ones get booked in at much higher rates particularly in auto and then the deposits finally stabilize and so you see us you see these scenarios where you get or or basis points of asset rate increases and because those mix change and a little bit of rate curve and then you just see the deposits stop increasing and that abating we think theres a big psychological lever there if the fed stops raising rates because consumers dont look at the back of the yield curve and think about should they be doing something else with their money as much as they do the headlines that continue of rising rates when that happens you can start to model out slower increases in deposit rates than the repricing of the fixed rate loans its very subtle thats why its hard to call you can be off by a couple of basis points and it goes the other way on you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you for that color and then i guess andy just i guess maybe the answer is stay tuned to december but i know in the past youve alluded quite a few times to the importance of positive operating leverage creation are you thinking that thats something thats kind of important and doable in or should we sort of think about it or like the way you think about it is that sort of broader is important over the longterm as opposed to in each individual year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well ill take a lot for me to give up on that in so for any of my own colleagues listening ill tell you thats our goal for and so were looking at both sides were looking at what the expense side is and were looking what are our investment strategic investment when we start to look at the shift in our balance sheet and my question to the team will be is how fast can we do it and part of thats market driven and part its execution on the execution front im gaining a lot of confidence in our leadership team theyve shown their ability to execute over the period since weve launched that initial plan in september of albeit we had an interesting four or five months this year but you can see the fundamentals still coming through so as we put that plan together the challenge put out to the team is to try to drive towards positive operating leverage in well see what the market looks like and what that allows but that is the message of what were trying to work for we dont have the final numbers in place yet for but thats still the direction r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you all very much andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp terry we still know youre mcevoy terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you thanks andy going back to the increase in commercial nonaccruals and i saw at the end of the release that potential problem loans i think they were investor cre how much of that increase would fall in the legacy bucket versus new lending relationships since the end of and maybe give you a platform to push back on some of the fears out there that associated with a late cycle grower and commercial and as such may see ill call it a faster normalization of credit trends patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah were not seeing that at all in whats happened this last quarter we had a handful of deals that moved into nonaccrual and i think i dont see any of the growth we went through the last couple of years isnt coming back to haunt us in terms of some of the migration weve got our real estate book we feel is really still holding up strong the real estate asset class is still gets hit by rising interest rates youve got inflationary pressures whether itd be on insurance real estate taxes all the operating expenses that go in there so i think theres still were still comfortable with how theyre weathering the storm but theres as you these costs remain elevated therell be a little more added pressure there but on our real estate book the stuff were doing is with longstanding relationships were not out doing transactional work with oneoff customers these are relationships weve targeted and grown throughout the years andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp maybe speak to the nonaccrual nature and trend of the real estate book but patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah really i mean in terms of nonaccruals we havent seen a lot in real estate i mean its really been more on the ci side that moved the needle here this quarter weve had some pretty strong stable performance in the book andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i mean in fact that nonaccruals have been down each of the past five associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp right andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp quarters and net chargeoffs have been negative over that five quarter period so if that would be the specific question terry we see no evidence of that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right and then maybe just a followup i think scott and jon asked a similar question does the fourth quarter expense guide i saw nonreoccurring items i was thinking related to the phase of the strategic plan not the fdic expense so does the fourth quarter guide reflect any strategic phase expenses and will we see a step up in expenses next year due to this announcement that will come out this quarter andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill speak to even though we havent given guidance on our approach has been the same each of the last two years weve gone into each year and when i came in this role folks suggested that maybe there was no room to cut theres always room to cut theres always room to cut for the next best investment that you need to make weve made those in each of the last two years we see opportunity for investment right now and before we do that we see opportunity to decrease expenses in some areas so that will be the approach that we have when we think about new initiatives people say gosh youre going to have very high expenses we have not in two years we will not in next year so thats what allows me to feel like were in the game with regards to positive operating leverage next year even though we need to fine tune and see where we end up with regards to expenses we dont necessarily have any extraordinary initiative spike in the fourth quarter as a result of initiatives that were planning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay yeah i was one of those people and you proved me wrong so i hear you loud and clear andy thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at the auto finance book im just wondering how close that book is to reaching a point of maturity meaning that youre starting to have some loans payoff im assuming that starts to accelerate somewhat in and as that process happens im just wondering what your expectation for growth is there is it expansion into some newer markets is that enough to offset that level of maturity or at some point should we see payoffs and kind of maturing loans in that space eat into the growth andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah the payoffs already happen i mean that book its interesting the duration of it has typically been historically been and for us been months or less and so youre seeing that were seeing that already on a monthly basis and so thats one of the positives about a book like that is that you work through it with regards to what happens in the future and the growth of that well be purposeful in having a exposure to auto and youll see that start to peak out and what the growth is hold steady and then probably go down a little bit over time which quarter that happens in is i wouldnt predict exactly what that quarter is but it wont be a runaway portfolio our goal is not to be simply known as the auto bank we have continued to invest in commercial we think we have a significant opportunity in fact market data shows us that were underpenetrated in deposits in key markets for commercial weve been working very diligently on bridging that gap we think that we are and so when we look at that and we look at the loan side we think theres opportunity in commercial timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then maybe from a credit standpoint and how the growth in auto corresponds with cecl accounting the look back has been nothing so far really just given how new that business line is however historically consumer auto tends to have a higher level of chargeoffs im just wondering how youre thinking about growth in that portfolio and how youre modeling that from a cecl standpoint and could we actually see a meaningful stepup once that book does start to normalize and we see chargeoffs move to more or less of a normal level there andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah timur ill start that and ill flip it over to pat but i saw that in a note that you had talking about the higher level of chargeoff and i wonder if were mixing strategies and by that i mean this is a prime and super prime book we know that the chargeoff rate is what through the cycle about to basis points so i consider it a low risk book we have about billion in consumer finance on our books of prime and super prime primarily in real estate between home equity and residential and we see that were lending to very similar customers in a balanced scorecard model so weve actually seen an increase in credit bureaus over the last credit bureau scores and those scores that we lent into this portfolio in the last month for example is fico of and i believe its around the month before and the overall book is between and so i dont consider this as a highrisk book at all associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 and because were lending to people that pay us back and were lending in a fashion that takes in multiple variables to calculate the risk parameters how else would you answer that pat patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp no i think thats good summary i mean we havent seen the maturation level yet but the metrics in terms of chargeoffs delinquencies et cetera are tracking in how we would expect it and weve been very happy with the deals that have gone into it and how they performed like andy said were in that prime and super prime space so its really kind of aligned with our expectations were timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color and then just last one there can you provide an update on how big that dealer network is and what that growth rate is expected to be in patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp yeah its about dealers right now and as derek said were expanding within the footprint i would say well go through the same course of our business model in terms of adding dealers where it makes sense based on their quality and how they fit our model andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp timur we havent provided guidance for yet timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i understand thank you very much for the color i appreciate the questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp

your question derek literally called me off right here associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated

so we bumped the high end up its as simple as that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp he really did want to answer that question chris derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp it took minutes sorry christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks a lot andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think we have one more in queue indiscernible derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp alicia andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp alicia are you there operator yeah sorry about that the next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please proceed with your question broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone how are you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good brody broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey so unfortunately like jon i also travel a lot and so im in an airport right now so if theres background noise or if you cant hear me i apologize in advance all right andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no worries derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no problem broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted just to quickly ask you about the fees i know you maintained the guidance but just given this quarters results when you kind of flow through the guide it implies a bit of a stepdown in the fourth quarter and i just wanted to know if there was anything specific driving that derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp theres not weve had pretty strong mortgage fees the last two quarters related to msr valuations going up that wont continue at that level but otherwise theres no specific guidance that would suggest a stepdown from our standpoint broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay i also wanted to just ask generically on the loan book if you could give us the personal loan portfolio that is shared national credits and of that what your the lead agent on patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp in terms of the makeup of our snc portfolio the largest concentration of that portfolio is within both power and utilities in our reit business both of those lending verticals reflect the successful business model weve had there for many years those lines of business as well as the full snc portfolio continue to perform very well from a credit standpoint so were happy with it we view sncs as something that we review both on the front end very specifically to make sure it fits the business model and were doing we continue to do from an underwriting and portfolio management standpoint we do the same from a credit standpoint with those deals as direct deals broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 understood thats great color do you happen to have what portion of the loan portfolio it is andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah brody thats not something we disclose and with regards to what were the lead in for me when i think of it were trying to lend into industries and customers that we understand and with that we see this as a fairly low risk portfolio from my perspective the question i have for the team is not that would we get out of these credits from a risk standpoint but would we get out of these credits from a return standpoint and so weve spent the last i dont know four months looking credit by credit across all of our portfolios and i see credits in every single almost every single portfolio of the bank that i believe that we could replace with the higher yielding asset and so as we go quarterbyquarter that will be i think all but with regards to sncs theres not a view that this is a highrisk portfolio and weve not seen the emergence of that or indication of it particularly in businesses that weve been for an extended period of time that have those type of loans broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc understood and then on the office portfolio do you have what the reserve that youre setting aside against the office loans are andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah just a second here broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah go ahead sorry patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp so i want to say weve been building that i dont have that specific number in front of me but weve been building that over the last couple of quarters our office portfolio has continued to remain pretty stable we have not seen a lot of degradation there but we do have an outsized reserve against it just given the uncertainty in that market broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it understood and then andy i just want to ask one last one just on the version of the plan that were going to get here down the road are those going to have kind of like any medium or longer term profitability targets that youre going to set out to achieve andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah brody what ill say about that as i try very hard not to get in front of the board and so well be meeting with them over the course of the next days to go over in detail once i make sure that i have proper governance i am very prepared in fact theyre holding me back from sharing what were going to do so theyre fair questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 they are good questions and we intend to have something later this quarter before year end that announces specifically what actions we intend to take so i hate to delay it that way but i must in this case broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc understood i appreciate you taking my questions everyone have a good night andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp all right thank you andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think i think thats it alicia thank you all for
