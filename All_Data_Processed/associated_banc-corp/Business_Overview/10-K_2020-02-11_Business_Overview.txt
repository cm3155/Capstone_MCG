item business table end general associated banccorp is a bank holding company registered pursuant to the bhc act our bank subsidiary associated bank traces its history back to the founding of the bank of neenah in we were incorporated in wisconsin in and were inactive until when permission was received from the federal reserve board to acquire three banks at december we owned one nationally chartered commercial bank headquartered in green bay wisconsin which serves local communities across the upper midwest one nationally chartered trust company headquartered in wisconsin and limited purpose banking and nonbanking subsidiaries either located in or conducting business primarily in our threestate footprint wisconsin illinois and minnesota that are closely related or incidental to the business of banking or financial in nature measured by total assets reported at december we are the largest commercial bank holding company headquartered in wisconsin and one of the top publicly traded bank holding companies headquartered in the us services through associated bank and various nonbanking subsidiaries we provide a broad array of banking and nonbanking products and services to individuals and businesses through banking branches at december serving more than communities primarily within our three state branch footprint our business is primarily relationshipdriven and is organized into three reportable segments corporate and commercial specialty community consumer and business and risk management and shared services see note segment reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information concerning our reportable segments we are not dependent upon a single or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on us employees at december we had fulltime equivalent employees none of our employees are represented by unions competition the financial services industry is highly competitive we compete for loans deposits and financial services in all of our principal markets we compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our markets internetbased banks outofmarket banks and bank holding companies that advertise or otherwise serve our markets money market funds and other mutual funds brokerage houses and various other financial institutions additionally we compete with insurance companies leasing companies regulated small loan companies credit unions governmental agencies and commercial entities offering financial services products including nonbank lenders and socalled financial technology companies competition involves among other things efforts to retain current customers and to obtain new loans and deposits the scope and types of services offered interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans as well as other aspects of banking we also face direct competition from subsidiaries of bank holding companies that have far greater assets and resources than ours supervision and regulation overview the corporation and its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and oversight both at the federal and state levels the following is an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework that affects the business of the corporation and our subsidiaries bank holding company act requirements as a registered bank holding company under the bhc act we are regulated supervised and examined by the federal reserve in connection with applicable requirements bank holding companies file periodic reports and other information with the federal reserve the bhc act also governs the activities that are permissible for bank holding companies and their affiliates and permits the federal reserve in certain circumstances to issue cease and desist orders and other enforcement actions against bank holding companies and their nonbanking affiliates to correct and curtail unsafe or unsound banking practices under the doddfrank act and longstanding federal reserve policy bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries pursuant to which such holding company may be required to commit financial resources to support such subsidiaries in circumstances when absent such requirements they might not otherwise do so the bhc act further regulates holding company activities including requirements and limitations relating to capital transactions with officers directors and affiliates securities issuances dividend payments interaffiliate liabilities extensions of credit and expansion through mergers and acquisitions the bhc act allows certain qualifying bank holding companies that elect treatment as financial holding companies to engage in activities that are financial in nature and that explicitly include the underwriting and sale of insurance the parent company thus far has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company bank holding companies that have not elected such treatment generally must limit their activities to banking activities and activities that are closely related to banking regulation of associated bank and trust company subsidiaries associated bank and our nationally chartered trust company subsidiary are regulated supervised and examined by the occ the occ has primary supervisory and regulatory authority over the operations of associated bank and the corporations trust company subsidiaries as part of this authority associated bank and our trust company subsidiaries are required to file periodic reports with the occ and are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ to support its supervisory function the occ has the authority to assess and charge fees on all national banks according to a set fee schedule on november the occ announced that it will reduce the rates in all fee schedules by percent for the calendar year thus reducing the assessment fees that associated bank will pay in associated bank our only subsidiary that accepts insured deposits is also subject to examination by the fdic we are subject to the enforcement and rulemaking authority of the cfpb regarding consumer financial products the cfpb has the authority to create and enforce consumer protection rules and regulations and has the power to examine us for compliance with such rules and regulations the cfpb also has the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than billion in assets such as associated bank the doddfrank act weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and gives broader rights to state attorneys general to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws on may the president signed into law the economic growth act which repealed or modified several important provisions of the doddfrank act among other things the economic growth act raises the total asset thresholds to billion for doddfrank act annual companyrun stress testing leverage limits liquidity requirements and resolution planning requirements for bank holding companies subject to the ability of the federal reserve to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns on october the occ adopted a final rule implementing portions of the economic growth act which among other things raises the minimum threshold for national banks to conduct stress tests from billion to billion as a result of the final rule which was effective as of november the bank is no longer subject to doddfrank act stress testing requirements the economic growth act also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas for which the banking agencies have now issued certain corresponding guidance documents andor proposed or final rules including prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on hvcre exposures unless they are for adc and clarifying adc status requiring the federal banking agencies to amend the liquidity coverage ratio rule such that all qualifying investmentgrade liquid and readilymarketable municipal securities are treated as level liquid assets making them more attractive investment alternatives exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than and directing the cfpb to provide guidance on the applicability of the tilarespa integrated disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and constructiontopermanent home loans as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes banking acquisitions we are required to obtain prior federal reserve approval before acquiring more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition the projected capital ratios and levels on a postacquisition basis and the acquiring institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank under the cra see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic banking subsidiary dividends the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and other nonbanking subsidiaries a substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends paid to us by associated bank the occs prior approval of the payment of dividends by associated bank to the parent company is required only if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the sum of the banks retained net income for that year and its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to surplus federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the banks undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the banks allowance for loan losses in addition under the fdicia an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions including the payment of dividends if after making such distribution the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdicia holding company dividends in addition we and the bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums the appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof under the doddfrank act and the requirements of the frb the parent company as a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank in addition consistent with its source of strength policy the frb has stated that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength the appropriate federal regulatory authorities have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the parent company and at the bank level administered by the federal reserve and the occ respectively failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action described below we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components risk weightings and other factors we have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards in july the federal reserve and the occ issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations these rules implemented certain provisions of the doddfrank act and basel iii the final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital increase riskbased capital requirements and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the final rules among other things revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds revise the components of regulatory capital and create a new capital measure called common equity tier which must constitute at least of riskweighted assets specify that tier capital consists only of common equity tier and certain additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements apply most deductions adjustments to regulatory capital measures to common equity tier and not to other components of capital potentially requiring higher levels of common equity tier in order to meet minimum ratio requirements increase the minimum tier capital ratio requirement from to retain the existing riskbased capital treatment for family residential mortgage exposures permit most banking organizations including the parent company to retain through a onetime permanent election the existing capital treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income implement a new capital conservation buffer of common equity tier capital equal to of riskweighted assets which will be in addition to the common equity tier capital ratio and be phased in over a three year period beginning january this buffer is generally required to make capital distributions and pay executive bonuses increase capital requirements for past due loans high volatility commercial real estate exposures and certain shortterm loan commitments require the deduction of mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that exceed of common equity tier capital in each category and of common equity tier capital in the aggregate and remove references to credit ratings consistent with the doddfrank act and establish due diligence requirements for securitization exposures in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to extend the regulatory capital treatment applicable during under the capital rules for certain items including regulatory capital deductions risk weights and certain minority interest limitations the relief provided under the final rule applies to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital rules advanced approaches such as the corporation specifically the final rule extends the regulatory capital treatment of msas and dtas arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock and common equity tier minority interest tier minority interest and total capital minority interest exceeding the capital rules minority interest limitations in july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule simplifying aspects of the capital rule the key elements of which apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule under the final rule banking organizations which are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule such as the corporation will be subject to simpler regulatory capital requirements for msas certain dtas arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions compared to those currently applied the final rule also simplifies the calculation for the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties sometimes referred to as a minority interest that is includable in regulatory capital specifically the final rule eliminates i the capital rules percent common equity tier capital deduction threshold that applies individually to msas temporary difference dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock ii the aggregate percent common equity tier capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items iii the percent common equity tier capital deduction threshold for nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and iv the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock the capital rule will no longer have distinct treatments for significant and nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions but instead will require that banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule deduct from common equity tier capital any amount of msas temporary difference dtas and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds percent of common equity tier capital the final rule will be effective on april and supersedes the transition rule the federal banking agencies adopted in to allow banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule to continue to apply the transition treatment in effect in in december the federal banking agencies issued a final rule on the capital treatment of hvcre exposures which brought the regulatory definition of hvcre exposure in line with the statutory definition of hvcre adc in the economic growth act the final rule also clarifies the capital treatment for loans that finance the development of land under the revised hvcre exposure definition and establishes the requirements for certain exclusions from hvcre exposures capital treatment we believe we will continue to exceed all capital requirements necessary to be deemed wellcapitalized for all regulatory purposes under these new rules on a fully phasedin basis for further detail on capital and capital ratios see discussion under the liquidity and capital sections under part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements in december the basel committee on banking supervision published the last version of the basel iii accord generally referred to as basel iv the basel committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of riskweighted assets which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk this will facilitate the comparability of banks capital ratios constraining the use of internally modeled approaches and complementing the riskweighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor leadership of the federal reserve occ and fdic who are tasked with implementing basel iv supported the revisions under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the corporation the impact of basel iv on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators current expected credit loss treatment in june the fasb issued an accounting standard update financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the current incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the cecl model under the cecl model we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and heldtomaturity debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount on december the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the dayone regulatory capital effects of the cecl model the final rule also revises the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards the final rule took effect april the new cecl standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december and for interim periods within those fiscal years we expect to recognize a onetime cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which we adopt the new standard consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of we incurred transition costs and also expect to incur ongoing costs in maintaining the additional cecl models and methodology along with acquiring forecasts used within the models and that the methodology will result in increased capital costs upon initial adoption as well as over time in october four federal banking agencies issued a request for comment on a proposed interagency policy statement on the new cecl methodology the policy statement proposes to harmonize the agencies policies on allowance for credit losses with the fasbs new accounting standards specifically the statement updates concepts and practices from prior policy statements issued in december and july and specifies which prior guidance documents are no longer relevant describes the appropriate cecl methodology in light of topic for determining acls on financial assets measured at amortized cost net investments in leases and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures and describes how to estimate an acl for an impaired availableforsale debt security in line with topic the proposed policy statement would be effective at the time that each institution adopts the new standards required by the fasb the impact at adoption is expected to have an after tax impact of a million to million decrease in the opening stockholders equity balance and a corresponding 21bps to 24bps decrease to the tangible common equity ratio see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the corporations impact of adoption capital planning and stress testing requirements as part of the regulatory relief provided by the economic growth act the asset threshold requiring insured depository institutions to conduct and report to their primary federal bank regulators annual companyrun stress tests was raised from billion to billion in total consolidated assets and the requirement was made periodic rather than annual upon enactment the economic growth act also provided that bank holding companies under billion in assets were no longer subject to stress testing requirements the amended regulations also provide the federal reserve with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than billion in total assets to enhanced supervision in addition section of the economic growth act and its implementing regulation prohibit the federal banking agencies from requiring the bank to assign a heightened risk weight to certain hvcre adc loans as previously required under the basel iii capital rules notwithstanding these regulatory amendments the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process although the corporation will continue to monitor and stress test its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators the corporation will no longer publish stress testing results as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies prompt corrective action the federal reserve the occ and the cfpb have extensive supervisory authority over their regulated institutions including among other things the power to compel higher reserves the ability to assess civil money penalties the ability to issue ceaseanddesist or removal orders and the ability to initiate injunctive actions in general these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices other actions or inactions by the parent company may provide the basis for enforcement action including misleading or untimely reports federal banking regulators are authorized and under certain circumstances required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements the federal banking agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions well capitalized institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction adequately capitalized institutions cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave them undercapitalized they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if after paying the fee they would be undercapitalized and they cannot accept renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the fdic we note that the economic growth act provides that reciprocal deposits are not treated as brokered deposits in the case of a well capitalized institution that received an outstanding or a good rating on its most recent examination to the extent the amount of such deposits does not exceed the lesser of billion or of the banks total liabilities the federal banking agencies are required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized insured depository institution any such bank must submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by the parent holding company until such plan is approved it may not increase its assets acquire another institution establish a branch or engage in any new activities and generally may not make capital distributions in certain situations a federal banking agency may reclassify a wellcapitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if the institution were in the next lower category institutions must file a capital restoration plan with the occ within days of the date it receives a notice from the occ that it is undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized compliance with a capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by a parent holding company in addition the occ is permitted to take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions including but not limited to the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors finally bank regulatory agencies have the ability to impose higher than normal capital requirements known as individual minimum capital requirements for institutions with a highrisk profile at december the bank satisfied the capital requirements necessary to be deemed well capitalized in the event of a change to this status the imposition of any of the measures described above could have a material adverse effect on the corporation and on its profitability and operations the corporations shareholders do not have preemptive rights and therefore if the corporation is directed by the occ or the fdic to issue additional shares of common stock such issuance may result in dilution in shareholders percentage of ownership of the corporation deposit insurance premiums associated bank is a member of the fdic and pays an insurance premium to the fdic based upon its assessment rates on a quarterly basis deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government under the doddfrank act a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to per depositor per insured depository institution for each account ownership category the doddfrank act also set the minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september the doddfrank act also required the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institutions average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity the assessment rate schedule for larger institutions like associated bank ie institutions with at least billion in assets differentiates between such large institutions by use of a scorecard that combines an institutions camels ratings with certain forwardlooking financial information to measure the risk to the dif pursuant to this scorecard method two scores a performance score and a loss severity score will be combined and converted to an initial base assessment rate the performance score measures an institutions financial performance and ability to withstand stress the loss severity score measures the relative magnitude of potential losses to the dif in the event of the institutions failure total scores are converted pursuant to a predetermined formula into an initial base assessment rate assessment rates range from bp to bp for large institutions premiums for associated bank are now calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus average tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter the fdic has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment if certain conditions are met on september the dif reserve ratio reached percent exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of percent ahead of the september deadline required under the doddfrank act fdic regulations provide that upon reaching the minimum surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of billion or more will cease the last quarterly surcharge was reflected in the banks december assessment invoice which covered the assessment period from july through september the banks assessment invoices have not included a quarterly surcharge since that time assessment rates which declined for all banks when the reserve ratio first surpassed percent in the third quarter of are expected to remain unchanged assessment rates are scheduled to decrease when the reserve ratio exceeds percent difinsured institutions pay a fico assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the in connection with the failures in the thrift industry the fico assessment was computed on assets as required by the doddfrank act these assessments continued until the bonds matured in september the corporations combined assessment rate for fdic and fico assessments was approximately bps for the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdicinsured institutions it is also authorized to terminate a depository banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for our national bank subsidiary would have a material adverse effect on our earnings operations and financial condition historically deposit insurance premiums we have paid to the fdic have been deductible for federal income tax purposes however the tax act disallows the deduction of such premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of billion or more for banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as ours the premium deduction is phased out based on the proportion of a banks assets exceeding billion on december the fdic issued a proposed rule on brokered deposits the proposed rule aims to clarify and modernize the fdics existing regulatory framework for brokered deposits notable aspects of the proposed rule include language defining the operative prongs of the definition of a deposit broker creating three general tests to determine the applicability of the primary purpose exception establishing an application process for entities that wish to make use of the primary purpose exception and allowing whollyowned subsidiaries of idis to make use of the idi or the own bank exception standards for safety and soundness the federal banking agencies have adopted the interagency guidelines for establishing standards for safety and soundness the guidelines the guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions the operational and managerial standards in the guidelines relate to the following internal controls and information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits asset quality and earnings rather than providing specific rules the guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution failure to meet the standards in the guidelines however could result in a request by the occ to one of the nationally chartered banks to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines failure to provide a plan or to implement a provided plan requires the appropriate federal banking agency to issue an order to the institution requiring compliance transactions with affiliates and insiders transactions between our national banking subsidiary and its related parties or any affiliate are governed by sections and of the federal reserve act an affiliate is any company or entity which controls is controlled by or is under common control with the bank in a holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a national bank and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and i limit the extent to which an institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institutions capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus and ii require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a nonaffiliate the term covered transaction includes the making of loans purchase of assets issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions certain types of covered transactions must be collateralized according to a schedule set forth in the statute based on the type of collateral certain transactions with our directors officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations among other things these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution see note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information on loans to related parties community reinvestment act requirements associated bank is subject to periodic cra reviews by the occ the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit the ability of such institutions to develop products and services believed bestsuited for a particular community an institutions cra assessment may be used by its regulators in their evaluation of certain applications including a merger acquisition or the establishment of a branch office an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for denial of such an application the bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent evaluation on december the fdic and the occ issued a proposed rule to modernize their respective agencies regulations under the cra the proposed rule would clarify which activities qualify for cra credit and require banks to identify an additional assessment area based on where they receive a significant portion of their domestic retail products thus creating two assessment areas a depositbased assessment area and a facilitybased assessment area the federal reserve chose not to participate in the current proposed rulemaking which causes uncertainty as to the content and timing of any final rule privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy and data protection under privacy protection provisions of the grammleachbliley act of and its implementing regulations and guidance we are limited in our ability to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties financial institutions such as the bank are required by statute and regulation to disclose their privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party in addition such financial institutions must appropriately safeguard its customers nonpublic personal information in many jurisdictions including every us state consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach the changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the california consumer privacy act which became effective in january create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data in addition multiple states congress and regulators outside the united states are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data federal banking agencies including the occ have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services in october the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more which would not currently include the corporation recent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity among other things financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internetbased services a financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the security of thirdparty service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution during the corporation did not discover any material cybersecurity incidents bank secrecy act antimoney laundering the bsa which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering mandates that every national bank have a written boardapproved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the bsa the program must at a minimum provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance provide for independent testing for compliance designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring daytoday compliance and provide training for appropriate personnel in addition national banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its bsa compliance program national banks are also required to file sars when they detect certain known or suspected violations of federal law or suspicious transactions related to a money laundering activity or a violation of the bsa in may the regulations implementing the bsa were amended effective may to explicitly include riskbased procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and procedures for understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile in addition fincen recently promulgated new customer due diligence and customer identification rules that require banks to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers other than those that are excluded at the time a new account is opened other than accounts that are exempted which rules became effective on may in addition to complying with the bsa the bank is subject to the patriot act the patriot act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the united states financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act mandates that financial service companies implement additional policies and procedures and take heightened measures designed to address any or all of the following matters customer identification programs money laundering terrorist financing identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions currency crimes and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities on december three federal banking agencies and fincen issued a joint statement clarifying the compliance procedures and reporting requirements that banks must file for customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp including a clear statement that banks need not file a sar on customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations this statement does not apply to cannabisrelated business thus the statement only pertains to customers who are lawfully growing or cultivating hemp and are not otherwise engaged in unlawful or suspicious activity interstate branching pursuant to the doddfrank act national and statechartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state eg a host state by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of tier capital in private equity and hedge funds known as the volcker rule on december five us financial regulators including the federal reserve and the occ adopted regulations implementing the volcker rule those regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for their own accounts and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds which are referred to as covered funds the regulations also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the volcker rule historically this meant that the largest banking entities ie those with billion or more in assets had higher reporting requirements but in november five federal banking agencies issued a final rule revising certain aspects of the volcker rule the final rule simplifies and streamlines compliance requirements for firms that do not have significant trading activities and enhances requirements for firms that do under the new rule compliance requirements will be based on the amount of assets and liabilities that a bank trades firms with significant trading activities ie those with billion or more in trading assets and liabilities will have heightened compliance obligations the new rule became effective on january but banking entities will not be required to comply with the new rules until january although we will benefit from significantly reduced compliance obligations due to the level of our trading assets being below the billion threshold we will remain subject to the modified rules and requirements related to covered funds accordingly we expect that the revised rule will reduce some of our compliance costs but in the short term we may experience some costs in developing and implementing changes in conformance with the new rule incentive compensation policies and restrictions in july the federal banking agencies issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies thereby including both the parent company and the bank pursuant to the guidance to be consistent with safety and soundness principles a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward be compatible with effective controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal banking agencies prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions generally institutions that have over billion in assets and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses the federal reserve will review as part of its standard riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the corporation that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the corporations ability to hire retain and motivate its key employees consumer financial services regulations federal and applicable state banking laws also require us to take steps to protect consumers bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations these laws include disclosures regarding truth in lending truth in savings and funds availability to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages credit cards and other consumer financial products and services the doddfrank act established the cfpb this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws as defined by the doddfrank act that among other things govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the cfpb include the equal credit opportunity act tila the truth in savings act the home mortgage disclosure act respa the fair debt collection practices act and the fair credit reporting act the cfpb is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services under tila as implemented by regulation z as amended by the cfpb effective january mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways the first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision current or reasonably expected income or assets current employment status the monthly payment on the covered transaction the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan the monthly payment for mortgagerelated obligations current debt obligations alimony and child support the monthly debttoincome ratio or residual income and credit history alternatively the mortgage lender can originate qualified mortgages which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the abilitytorepay requirements in general a qualified mortgage is a mortgage loan without negative amortization interestonly payments balloon payments or terms exceeding years in addition to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed of the total loan amount qualified mortgages that are higherpriced eg subprime loans garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the abilitytorepay rules while qualified mortgages that are not higherpriced eg prime loans are given a safe harbor of compliance the corporation is predominantly an originator of compliant qualified mortgages additionally the cfpb has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agencys jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than billion the bank is subject to the cfpbs supervisory and enforcement authorities the doddfrank act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb as a result of these aspects of the doddfrank act the bank operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment therefore the bank is likely to incur additional costs related to consumer protection compliance including but not limited to potential costs associated with cfpb examinations regulatory and enforcement actions and consumeroriented litigation which is likely to increase as a result of the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws the federal financial regulatory agencies including the occ and states attorneys general also have become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company such as the parent company if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on the corporations and the banks operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic other banking regulations the bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to the operation of its businesses including but not limited to the doddfrank act which among other restrictions placed limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit card transactions tila truth in savings act equal credit opportunity act

laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly under review by congress the federal regulatory agencies and the state authorities these laws and regulations could be changed drastically in the future which could affect our profitability our ability to compete effectively or the composition of the financial services industry in which we compete government monetary policies and economic controls our earnings and growth as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities including the federal reserve an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and changes in the federal reserve discount rate these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits the monetary policies of the federal reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates deposit levels and loan demand or their effect on our business and earnings or on the financial condition of our various customers other regulatory authorities in addition to regulation supervision and examination by federal banking agencies the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries including those that engage in securities brokerage dealing and investment advisory activities are subject to other federal and applicable state securities laws and regulations and to supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities including the sec finra nyse dol and others significantly in june the us court of appeals issued a mandate vacating the dols fiduciary rule and related prohibited transaction exemptions as a result although the bank may have taken certain measures to comply with the rule on a transitional basis the banks securities brokerage and investment advisory services and activities will no longer be affected separately in june pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec adopted regulation best interest which among other things establishes a new standard of conduct for a brokerdealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer the new rule requires us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities which is causing us to incur some additional costs in addition state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures in addition the banks insurance agency subsidiary is also subject to regulation and supervision in the various states in which it operates the tax act was signed into law in december and includes a number of provisions that impact us including the following tax rate the tax act replaced the graduated corporate tax rates applicable under prior law which imposed a maximum tax rate of with a reduced flat tax rate although the reduced tax rate generally should be favorable to us by resulting in increased earnings and capital it decreased the value of our thenexisting deferred tax assets effective in the fourth quarter of the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the tax rate is a nonrecurring event that generally is not expected to have a substantial adverse impact on the our core earnings or capital over the long term tax planning strategies relating to the tax year were implemented in which reduced the amount of the deferred tax assets at december reducing the decrease in value of the deferred tax assets calculated in the fourth quarter of the corporation has recorded and reported the effects of these strategies in its financial statements for the period ended december fdic insurance premiums the tax act prohibits taxpayers with consolidated assets over billion from deducting any fdic insurance premiums and prohibits taxpayers with consolidated assets between and billion such as the bank from deducting the portion of their fdic premiums equal to the ratio expressed as a percentage that i the taxpayers total consolidated assets over billion as of the close of the taxable year bears to ii billion as a result associated banks ability to deduct its fdic premiums is now limited employee compensation a publicly held corporation is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of million per year paid to certain employees the tax act eliminated certain exceptions to the million limit applicable under prior law related to performancebased compensation such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals as a result our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to our most highly compensated employees is now limited business asset expensing the tax act allows taxpayers immediately to expense the entire cost instead of only as under prior law of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after september and before january with an additional year for certain property this bonus depreciation is phased out proportionately for property placed in service on or after january and before january with an additional year for certain property interest expense the tax act limits a taxpayers annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of i business interest income and ii of adjusted taxable income defined as a businesss taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense net operating losses and for through depreciation amortization and depletion because we generate significant amounts of net interest income we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation the foregoing description of the impact of the tax act on us should be read in conjunction with note income taxes of the notes to
