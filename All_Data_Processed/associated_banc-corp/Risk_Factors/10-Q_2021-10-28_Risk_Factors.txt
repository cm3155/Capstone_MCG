state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance on march president biden unveiled his infrastructure plan which includes a proposal to increase the federal corporate tax rate from to as part of a package of tax reforms to help fund the spending proposals in the plan if adopted as proposed the increase of the corporate tax rate would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods congress is expected to debate the adoption of an infrastructure initiative in the coming weeks and months however the prospects and timing for the enactment of any such legislation as well as its specific provisions including funding options and the extent of its potential impact on our results of operations if enacted cannot be predicted at this time cyberattacks including those targeting critical infrastructure sectors have become more frequent and sophisticated critical infrastructure sectors including financial services increasingly have been the targets of cyberattacks including attacks emanating from foreign countries such as the attack on the information technology company solarwinds which affected many fortune companies as well as us government agencies attacks involving large financial institutions including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customerfacing services nation state cyberattacks and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems and targeted social engineering and email attacks designed to allow unauthorized persons to obtain access to an institutions information systems and data or that of its customers are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated and can be difficult to prevent reports of ransomware incidents specifically have increased by approximately since the start of and information technology software supply chain attacks including those involving financial institutions also have increased during this period some of which have resulted in temporary but impactful disruptions to the functioning of critical infrastructure sectors or the operations of specific institutions in addition cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have evolved as a result of the use of new technologies devices and delivery channels to transmit data and conduct financial transactions while the ongoing and widespread remote work environment necessitated by the covid19 pandemic has subjected institutions to additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks any successful cyberattack or other security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information or that compromises our ability to function could severely damage our reputation erode confidence in the security of our systems products and services expose us to the risk of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business any successful cyberattack may also subject the corporation to regulatory investigations litigation or enforcement or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cybersecurity incident all or any of which could adversely affect the corporations business financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation recent actions by the biden administration regarding competition in the financial services and technology sectors may adversely impact our business on july president biden issued an executive order on promoting competition in the american economy the executive order among other initiatives the executive order i encourages the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices under the bank holding company act of as amended and the bank merger act and within days of the date of the executive order adopt a plan for revitalization of such practices and ii directs the bureau of consumer financial protection the cfpb to commence or continue a rulemaking to facilitate the portability of consumer financial transaction data for the purpose of providing consumers with greater flexibility in switching financial institutions and using innovative financial products although the scope and substance of any action by the federal banking agencies in response to the directives set forth in the executive order cannot be predicted at this time the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions may adversely affect the marketplace for such transactions in the near to mediumterm and could result in our acquisitions in future periods being delayed impeded or restricted in certain respects due to enhanced regulatory review processes similarly although the cfpb has published principles for consumerauthorized financial data sharing and aggregation we cannot predict the scope substance or timing of any future cfpb rulemaking regarding the portability of financial transaction data in response to the executive order the impact of any such rulemaking on the conduct of our customers also cannot be predicted however the adoption of any such rule could result in increased volatility of consumer accounts and expose the corporation to additional operational strategic regulatory and compliance risks we are subject to environmental social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities the corporation is subject to a variety of risks arising from environmental social and governance matters or esg matters esg matters include climate risk hiring practices the diversity of our work force and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business risks arising from esg matters may adversely affect among other things our reputation and the market price of our securities in recognition of the risks posed by climate change the corporation has taken a variety of actions to manage its carbon footprint and has sought to engage in sustainable lending and investment activities specifically including supporting renewable energy projects however we cannot guarantee the success of these actions nor can we make any assurances that our regulators investors in our securities or other third parties such as environmental advocacy organizations will find our efforts to support climaterelated initiatives to be sufficient further we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the publics view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to esg matters any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms the corporations relationships and reputation with its existing and prospective customers and third parties with which we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity this in turn could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for securities investors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address esg matters when making investment and operational decisions certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to the risks posed by climate change and other esg matters into their investment theses these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that the corporation has not made sufficient progress on esg matters the leadership of each of the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ the federal reserve board and the us treasury department have indicated increased expectations of larger financial institutions to measure monitor and manage climate related risk as part of their enterprise risk management processes for instance the occ currently is engaged in multiple collaborative initiatives with other governmental authorities to assess the physical and transition risk posed by climate change and the appropriate corresponding expectations for bank risk management the occ also has appointed its first ever climate change risk officer to assist with these initiatives and to support the agencys efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management further the federal reserve board has signaled that it is in the process of developing scenario analysis to model the possible financial risks associated with climate change when developed the resilience of large banking organizations as well as the broader financial system will be evaluated against these climate changerelated scenarios as part of the stress testing process although these requirements would not apply to a banking organization of our size as the corporation continues to grow and expand the scope of our operations our regulators generally will expect us to enhance our internal control programs and processes including with respect to stress testing under a variety of adverse scenarios and related capital planning to the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the corporation we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliancerelated risks fiscal challenges facing the us government could negatively impact financial markets which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations recent federal budget deficit concerns and political conflict over legislation to raise the us governments debt limit have increased the possibility of a default by the us government on its debt obligations related creditrating downgrades or an economic recession in the united states many of our investment securities are issued by the us government and government agencies and sponsored entities as a result of uncertain domestic political conditions including the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks in connection with prior political disputes over us fiscal and budgetary issues leading to the us government shutdown in sp lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa a further downgrade or a similar downgrade by other rating agencies in response to current political dynamics as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the us and worldwide
