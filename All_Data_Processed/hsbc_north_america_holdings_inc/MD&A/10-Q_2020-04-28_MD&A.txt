and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda as we us or our economic environment the us economy began to deteriorate rapidly in march as the covid19 pandemic spread across the globe including into the united states causing severe disruption to the capital markets as well as business and economic activity over the course of the month of march individual municipalities and entire states adopted travel and work location restrictions social distancing requirements and in some cases shelter in place protocols in order to slow the spread of the virus these measures have shut down normal life in much of the united states resulting in a collapse of spending as well as shutdowns of many schools stores offices restaurants and manufacturing plants creating a surge in layoffs us gross domestic product gdp is now expected to contract for at least the first two quarters of and in total for the year while the total unemployment rate increased to percent at march and is expected to significantly increase in future months in march with the us economy in decline as a result of increased economic uncertainty driven by the covid19 pandemic the frb decided to cut shortterm interest rates by basis points to near zero and also announced various other initiatives to enhance liquidity and support the flow of credit to households and businesses the impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the united states and abroad during the first quarter of has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment including the length and depth of any global recession which most believe will occur concerns over interest rate levels domestic and global policy issues us trade policy and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty interest rate levels in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends as mentioned above the covid19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the united states and has caused disruption to our customers vendors and employees the outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries this pandemic has had a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations during the first quarter including the impairment of goodwill associated with our retail banking and wealth management and private banking reporting units an increase to the provision for credit losses on our loan portfolio and valuation losses associated with certain financial instruments due to market volatility additionally in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for hsbc the circumstances around this pandemic are evolving rapidly and will continue to impact our business in future periods should the covid19 pandemic continue to cause disruption to economic activity through there could be further impacts on our income due to lower interest rates lower lending and transaction volumes and lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness other potential risks include credit rating migration which could negatively impact our riskweighted assets and capital position and potential liquidity stress due among other factors to increased customer drawdowns notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the us government and the frb have put in place to support funding and liquidity this matter could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects liquidity financial condition results of operations and credit ratings in future periods the extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak as well as its continuing impact on our customers vendors and employees all of which are uncertain see part ii item risk factors risks related to the impact of covid19 for further discussion during the first quarter of we decided to pause the vast majority of head count reductions relating to our restructuring plan due to the extraordinary impact of the covid19 pandemic however many elements of our restructuring plan are moving forward as planned including consolidation of our retail branch network and wholesale back office functions and the creation of our wealth and personal banking business while we remain committed to our multiyear strategic plan to reprofile our business the timing of the strategic actions as outlined in our form 10k may be resequenced or delayed beyond months as the situation continues to develop in light of covid19 we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods see note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial statements hsbc usa inc the following table

not exceeding hsbc usa inc net income loss was a loss of million during the three months ended march compared with income of million during the three months ended march income loss before income tax was a loss of million during the three months ended march compared with income of million during the three months ended march the decrease in income loss before income tax during the three months ended march was due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of as discussed below and a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the covid19 pandemic also contributing to the decrease was lower net interest income during the first quarter of as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the covid19 pandemic across the globe including into the united states and its impact on our businesses including changes to the interest rate environment as a result of recent frb actions to combat the economic effects of the virus and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was lower than their carrying amounts including goodwill based on this analysis we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed for all of our reporting units as of march and prepared updated cash flow projections for each reporting unit resulting in a reduction in the longterm forecasts of profitability for both our retail banking and wealth management and our private banking reporting units as compared to the prior year forecasts these projections were reviewed by senior management in early april in connection with the preparation of our first quarter financial statements and it was determined that these forecasts represent our current best estimate of future profitability and would be used to conduct our interim impairment test we completed our interim impairment test of goodwill utilizing cash flow projections based on these forecasts under a present value approach and in conjunction with valuation estimates determined under a market approach concluded that the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill however the cash flow projections for our retail banking and wealth management and our private banking reporting units were significantly lower which in conjunction with valuation estimates under a market approach and in consideration of a challenging macroeconomic outlook resulted in a fair value that was significantly lower than their book values including goodwill as a result we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million in the first quarter of representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to these reporting units as discussed in our form 10k our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used we will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings if further deterioration in economic and credit conditions a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required which may result in an impairment charge our reported results in certain periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant which affect comparability between periods significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends the following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented three months ended march in millions income loss before income tax as reported goodwill impairment costs to achieve adjusted performance reflects costs related to the delivery of the strategic plan we announced in february to restructure our operations restructuring plan as discussed further in executive overview in mda in our form 10k costs to achieve during the three months ended march primarily related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and included lease impairment and other related costs of million severance costs of million and allocated costs from hsbc technology services htsu of million see note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information the expense during the three months ended march also includes a million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties represents a nonus gaap financial measure excluding the impact of the items in the table above our adjusted performance during the three months ended march decreased million compared with prior year period due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the covid19 pandemic and to a lesser extent lower net interest income these increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses see results of operations for

jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ibors to acceptable alternative rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr recommended by the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the frb in march the fasb issued changes to the us gaap guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens associated with this transition under the new guidance an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract if certain conditions are met in addition the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedgebyhedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform if certain conditions are met we have a considerable number of contracts referencing ibors primarily libor such as loans derivatives and longterm debt extending past when the uk financial conduct authority has announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for libor we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy libor contracts onto replacement rates in particular during the first quarter of we implemented risk disclosures for new sales of liborbased products across all of our business lines and incorporated the new fallback language recommended by the arrc into new liborbased contracts for adjustable rate mortgage loans while we continued to progress in developing plans for transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates given the focus on the covid19 pandemic and resulting market volatility that began in march we are currently targeting to have pricing and dataworkflow requirements finalized in the second quarter of for further discussion of our libor transition program and the associated risks see executive overview in mda in our form 10k other developments the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries including the united states and the us government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the covid19 pandemic the united states has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since march on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act which provides financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions was signed into law paycheck protection program the cares act creates a new loan guarantee program called the paycheck protection program ppp targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses loans made under the ppp are fully guaranteed by the small business administration sba whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states ppp covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the ppp covered loan plus accrued interest if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest lease and utility payments and certain other criteria are satisfied the sba will reimburse ppp lenders for any amount of a ppp covered loan that is forgiven and ppp lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by ppp borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness hsbc bank usa is a ppp participating lender loan forbearance initiatives the cares act also creates a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans and provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under us gaap related to troubled debt restructurings we are currently evaluating whether to elect this option the cares act also prohibits servicers of federallybacked mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of days beginning on march in addition to these federal measures some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees for example new yorks governor issued an executive order on march that requires the superintendent of the new york department of financial services nydfs to ensure that regulated entities provide forbearance of mortgage payments for new york state persons or entities facing financial hardship due to covid19 and empowers the nydfs to restrict or modify fees for atm use overdraft fees and credit card late fees the nydfs issued emergency regulations on march clarifying that the executive order as implemented through the emergency regulations applies only to banking organizations regulated by the nydfs and therefore does not apply to us however we are continuing to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to covid19 and their potential impact on our operations hsbc usa inc basis of reporting our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb and endorsed by the eu and as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following table reconciles our us gaap versus group reporting basis profit before tax three months ended march in millions profit loss before tax us gaap basis adjustments expected credit losses goodwill impairment deposit incentives leases precious metal loans other profit loss before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k in addition see note business segments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the first quarter of expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our commercial loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses estimate as a result of the different approaches the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the spread of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts used to calculate ecl and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit was more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of goodwill impairment charges were lower under the group reporting basis than under us gaap under the group reporting basis goodwill was amortized until however goodwill was amortized under us gaap until which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and therefore a lower impairment charge under the group reporting basis during the first quarter of credit loss estimates were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio which was more pronounced under us gaap in addition expected credit losses under the group reporting basis reflect a release in credit loss reserves due to the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from stage which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate to stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate hsbc usa inc critical accounting policies and estimates of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have identified certain items as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity see critical accounting policies and estimates in mda in our form 10k for further discussion determining the allowance for credit losses on loans has historically been identified as a critical accounting estimate on january we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses lifetime ecl for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost previously an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses see note allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for offbalance sheet credit exposures beginning in the accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remains a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance including cash flows delinquencies and chargeoffs along with when applicable collateral values based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forwardlooking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default and the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices interest rates gdp inflation energy prices and unemployment and judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ecl because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates our estimate of lifetime ecl is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses as discussed further in note allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of the covid19 pandemic during the first quarter of and the related increase in economic uncertainty three new covid19 forwardlooking economic scenarios were developed and utilized for estimating lifetime ecl at march the three new covid19 scenarios referred to as mild moderate and severe were assigned weightings with the majority of the weighting placed on the mild scenario and progressively lower weights placed on the moderate and severe scenarios this weighting was deemed appropriate for the estimation of lifetime ecl under current conditions as an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses using a percent weighting for the severe covid19 scenario instead of using the three weighted covid19 scenarios as described above at march would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for offbalance sheet credit exposures of approximately million this illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur hsbc usa inc balance sheet review the

allowance for credit losses on loans commercial loans increased compared with december due primarily to elevated demand as clients drew on their available lines of credit during the current deterioration in economic conditions and to a lesser extent higher loans to affiliates the increase in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the consumer services consumer durables and apparel commercial and professional services retailing and capital goods industries consumer loans increased modestly compared with december as higher residential mortgage loans were largely offset by seasonal paydowns in credit card receivables and a continued decline in home equity mortgages the increase in other consumer loans reflects higher personal loans driven by new product promotions the

federal housing finance agencys house pricing index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in

change is greater than percent see note trading assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category trading securities balances decreased compared with december due to decreases in equity and foreign sovereign positions partially offset by an increase in us treasury positions trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets balances of securities sold not yet purchased were lower compared with december driven by a decrease in short us treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio precious metals trading assets increased compared with december due primarily to an increase in our own gold inventory position held as economic hedges for client derivative activity payables for precious metals were lower compared with december reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with december mainly from market movements which resulted in higher valuations of foreign exchange interest rate commodity and credit derivatives market movements on equity derivatives were mixed resulting in higher derivative asset valuations but lower derivative liability valuations securities securities include securities availableforsale and securities heldtomaturity net securities balances were higher compared with december driven by net purchases of securities availableforsale as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes and to a lesser extent favorable market valuations due to decreasing yields the increase in securities balances was primarily in us government sponsored mortgagebacked us treasury and us government agency mortgagebacked securities all other assets all other assets includes among other items properties and equipment net and goodwill all other assets increased compared with december due primarily to higher outstanding settlement balances related to security sales higher cash collateral posted and increased investments in federal home loan bank fhlb stock these increases were

support elevated client demand for loans driven by deteriorating economic conditions in march while maintaining adequate liquidity which resulted in higher deposits from affiliates and increased commercial demand deposits with a continued focus on high quality balances the higher deposits from affiliates also reflects billion of longterm debt obligations issued to hsbc north america that were recharacterized as time deposits during the first quarter of as discussed below also contributing to the increase in deposits was higher retail deposits driven by promotional rates offered on savings accounts as well as higher deposits in private banking these increases in deposits were partially offset by a decline in commercial time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals shortterm

with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities net interest income decreased during the three months ended march due primarily to the unfavorable net impact of lower market rates which resulted in lower interest income from shortterm investments loans and securities partially offset by lower interest expense from longterm debt shortterm borrowings and

income decreased during the three months ended march due primarily to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates trading securities interest income increased

summary of significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in our form 10k concentration of credit risk a concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions we enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and offbalance sheet credit risk principal among these activities is lending to various commercial institutional governmental and individual customers throughout the united states and internationally we manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and offbalance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval monitoring and reporting process it is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon managements credit evaluation our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans interestonly loans a loan which allows a customer to pay the interestonly portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period adjustable rate mortgage arm loans a loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements the following table summarizes the

replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures hsbc usa inc the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules march december in millions risk associated with derivative contracts total credit risk exposure less collateral held against exposure net credit risk exposure liquidity and

companies are permitted to temporarily exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr as a result of this relief hsbc usas slr increased to approximately percent at april in response to the covid19 pandemic on march the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a fiveyear period this option comes in addition to the separate threeyear transition option already available hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa elected the fiveyear transition option and as a result beginning in capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the interim final rule we manage capital in accordance with hsbc group policy the hsbc north america internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap works in conjunction with the hsbc groups icaap the hsbc north america icaap applies to hsbc bank usa and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk to the extent that local alternatives are insufficient as a whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc we would seek support from our ultimate parent regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held plus applicable capital buffers as defined by regulations and the amount of riskweighted assets and leverage exposure also calculated based on regulatory definitions we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by us banking regulators including basel iii the basel iii rule under the basel iii rule there are two methods available to calculate riskweighted assets the generallyapplicable standardized approach and the advanced approaches which are required in addition to the standardized approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds in the frb and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act relief act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies bhcs and foreign banking organizations the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each bhc and ihc with billion or more in total us assets into one of five classifications categories i through iv and other firms based on its size and four riskbased indicators under the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to category iii standards beginning january and are no longer considered advanced approaches banking organizations however hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to advanced approaches banking organizations including the slr and the countercyclical capital buffer prior to adoption of the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the advanced approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their riskbased capital requirements for credit risk solely under the standardized approach the tailoring rules also permit category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in regulatory capital as a result hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa made a onetime election to optout of the requirement to include all components of aoci with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in common equity tier capital effective beginning with march reporting category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries will also benefit from i simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and ii a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties generally known as minority interests which can be included in regulatory capital these simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking hsbc usa inc finalized by the federal banking agencies in and are effective beginning april although firms may choose to apply the simplifications as early as january as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa implemented both the tailoring rules and the simplifying amendments beginning with march reporting in the federal banking agencies also jointly amended the basel iii rule to implement a provision of the relief act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to highvolatility commercial real estate exposures and also finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk saccr to calculate total riskweighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method cem these changes are also effective beginning april the tailoring rules clarify that category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are not required to use saccr to measure their derivative exposure instead they have the option to use either saccr or cem for their riskbased capital ratios and the slr as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have elected not to use saccr at this time but will continue to evaluate the impact of adopting saccr in the future for additional discussion of the basel iii final rule requirements including required minimum capital ratios as well as further discussion of the tailoring rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see part i regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in our form 10k and also below under the caption other regulatory developments we continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments capital planning and stress testing the frb requires ihcs and bhcs including hsbc north america to comply with the frbs capital plan rule and ccar program as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb and annual companyrun stress tests as required under doddfrank collectively dfast as amended by the relief act under the tailoring rules hsbc north america as a category iii firm is no longer subject to a midcycle stress testing requirement beginning january and is now required to disclose its companyrun stress test results only every other year the companyrun stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the frb and internally developed scenarios for the companyrun exercises on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bankholding company over a nine quarter planning horizon on march the frb adopted a final rule on the stress capital buffer scb which will among other things replace the current fixed percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic institutionspecific riskbased scb it is expected that the scb will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on a firms risk exposures and the severity of its stress scenarios under the final rule the scb would be recalibrated annually based on the sum of i a firms projected losses under the severely adverse scenario in supervisory stress tests and ii four quarters of a firms planned future dividends if hsbc north americas riskbased capital ratios were to fall to levels within the scb it would become subject to increasing restrictions on their capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the final rule also eliminates the quantitative objection component of ccar and instead relies on the capital rules automatic restrictions on capital distributions that are triggered if a firm breaches its buffer requirements the scb will be determined initially based on supervisory stress testing results conducted as part of ccar and will become effective october hsbc north america already utilizes an internal capital assessment approach that is analogous to the scb and will continue to review the composition of its capital structures and capital buffers in light of the final rule the scb applies only to hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa remain subject to a static percent capital conservation buffer for further discussion on capital planning and stress testing including detail regarding the frbs supervisory assessment as part of the ccar process as well as further discussion of the tailoring rules and other recent regulatory developments and their expected impact see part i regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in our form 10k and also below under the caption other regulatory developments hsbc north america submitted its latest ccar capital plan and their latest annual companyrun dfast results in april hsbc north america will publicly disclose their latest annual dfast results as required within days of the frb disclosing the results of its own dfast results the frb will publicly disclose its own dfast and ccar results on or before june stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of hsbc north america capital planning and stress testing for hsbc north america may impact our future capital and liquidity while bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the hsbc north america level and also separately for hsbc bank usa as a bank holding company we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the frb we present our capital ratios together with hsbc bank usas in note retained earnings and regulatory capital requirements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements other regulatory developments frb liquidity facilities the frb announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets addressing immediate liquidity concerns and facilitating lending and other assistance to businesses and individuals affected by shutdowns due to covid19 these programs include among others the money market mutual fund liquidity facility the term assetbacked hsbc usa inc securities loan facility the commercial paper funding facility the primary market corporate credit facility and the paycheck protection program liquidity facility we are evaluating whether to utilize any of these programs as an additional source of funding regulatory capital revision the federal banking agencies have also announced certain changes to the regulatory capital requirements designed to address concerns arising from covid19 on april the frb issued an interim final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the slr that permits bank holding companies such as hsbc north america to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr this change which took effect april will remain in place until march and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households we continue to assess this slr relief and the composition of our balance sheet particularly given that the exclusion does not apply to tier leverage ratios funding strategy our current estimate for funding needs and sources for are summarized in the following table actual january through march estimated april through december estimated full year in billions increase decrease in funding needs net change in loans net change in shortterm investments and securities net change in trading and other assets total funding needs increase decrease in funding sources net change in deposits net change in trading and other shortterm liabilities net change in longterm debt total funding sources reductions to trading assets estimated during the april through december period are mainly related to select fixed income activities which will be consolidated in and operated from europe to better utilize hsbcs global scale which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet as previously discussed the timing of our strategic actions may be resequenced or delayed in light of covid19 we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods the above table reflects a longterm funding strategy daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile should market conditions deteriorate we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions we remain confident in our ability to access the market for longterm debt funding needs in the current market environment we continue to seek wellpriced and stable customer deposits we also continue to sell new agencyeligible mortgage loan originations to third parties hsbc bank usa is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other covered transactions with hsbc usa and other affiliates for further discussion see part i regulation and competition affiliate transaction restrictions in our form 10k see risk management in this mda for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management hsbc usa inc offbalance sheet arrangements credit derivatives and other contractual obligations as part of our normal operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and in certain cases guarantees as a financial services provider we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee the following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and offbalance sheet arrangements many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business strategy as described under the heading executive overview business update in our form 10k will affect our contractual obligations over time including with respect to credit derivatives as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements balance at march one year or less over one through five years over five years total balance at december in millions standby letters of credit net of participations commercial letters of credit credit derivatives other commitments to extend credit commercial consumer total includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at march and december respectively includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at march and december respectively includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at march and december respectively other commitments to extend credit other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans lease financing receivables or similar transactions consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit in addition to the above we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value cnav money market funds that invest in shorterdated highlyrated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment these funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price the funds however are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than basis points from the portfolios market value in that case the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price we do not consolidate the cnav funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the funds assets including interest rate liquidity credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets hsbc usa inc fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and beginning january certain student loans held for investment as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at march and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations assetbacked credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable certain corporate debt securities certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans derivatives hsbc usa inc referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at march and december march december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at march includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at march includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three months ended march and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at march the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain dealcontingent forward starting interest rate derivatives risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors and the compliance and conduct committee in particular the risk committee of the board of directors advises the board of directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract hsbc usa inc capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime and fraud risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including both internal and external fraud strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently model results may be considered reasonable estimates with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk asu process on january we adopted the requirements of asu financial instruments credit losses asu the implementation of asu represents a significant challenge to our risk and finance functions the asu introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ecl some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the ifrs financial instruments ifrs credit loss reporting that we implemented in for segment reporting under the group reporting basis as a result of asu adoption management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which over time may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes the asu process comprises three main areas modeling the risk function had preexisting models developed in conjunction with our ifrs reporting to hsbc these models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of asu such as incorporating forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period reversion to historical losses the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions and lifetime ecl for undrawn credit exposures with the appropriate governance and independent review the models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned implementation a centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ecl calculation the impairment engine receives data which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements from a variety of client finance and risk systems once the lifetime ecl calculation has been calculated there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance risk and finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process governance a management review committee has been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ecl calculation the management review committee has representatives from credit risk and finance and is responsible for final approval of our lifetime ecl for the period the chief credit officer and the rbwm chief risk officer share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost capital and liquidity risk management although our overall approach to capital and liquidity risk management has not changed we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices see hsbc usa inc risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to capital and liquidity risk capital risk see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a discussion of our approach to capital risk including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy the basel committee based liquidity coverage ratio lcr is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days at both march and december hsbc usas lcr under the european lcr rule exceeded percent a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us lcr rule and are required to report lcr to us regulators on a daily basis the tailoring rules reduced the us lcr requirement for category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa from to percent beginning january as a result under the us lcr rule a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario during the three months ended march hsbc bank usas lcr under the us lcr rule remained above the percent minimum requirement the european calibration of the basel committee based net stable funding ratio nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities is still pending therefore our calculation of nsfr is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the european calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators at both march and december hsbc usas estimated nsfr exceeded percent a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in april us regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the nsfr in the united states applicable to certain large banking organizations including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa the tailoring rules also indicate that an percent nsfr requirement will apply to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa once the nsfr is finalized as a result under the proposed us nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures at both march and december hsbc bank usas estimated nsfr based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed us nsfr rule exceeded percent as a category iii firm hsbc north america remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition current regulatory initiatives require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table reflects the short and longterm credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa at march moodys sp fitch hsbc usa shortterm borrowings p1 a1 f1 longtermsenior debt a2 a a hsbc bank usa shortterm borrowings p1 a1 f1 longtermsenior debt aa3 aa aa rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions hsbc usa inc in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for hsbc the outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the covid19 pandemic while the outlook changed fitch affirmed the longterm credit rating for hsbc usa concurrently fitch upgraded the longterm credit rating for hsbc bank usa by one notch to aa following a review of hsbcs resolution plan while these rating actions did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any future actions could have such an impact although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at march there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading portfolios trading var generates from the global markets unit of the gbm business segment portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products interest rate swaps credit default swaps and precious metals ie gold silver platinum in both north america and emerging markets the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for the three months ended march foreign exchange and commodity interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december hsbc usa inc portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect on average to see two or three profits and two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period the actual number of profits or losses in excess of var over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing to ensure a conservative approach to calculating our risk exposures it is important to note that profits in excess of var are only considered when backtesting the accuracy of models and are not used for capital purposes during the first quarter of we experienced nine profit and six loss backtesting exceptions two profit exceptions and one loss exception in january were mainly driven by palladium volatility seven profit exceptions and five loss exceptions in march were primarily driven by intensified market volatility as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic shutting down the global economy including delivery disruptions in the gold market which became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings dramatic volatility in credit spreads and heightened rates volatility this global event caused price disruptions that have not been observed in the past two years which is the period used in the historical var calculation the volatility highlighted in backtesting exceptions were greater than the percent confidence level used to determine var quantum nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to balance sheet management bsm and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the three months ended march interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table above for additional information the increase in nontrading var at march was due primarily to an increase in price and rate volatility driven by the spread of the covid19 pandemic nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into bsm which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it see below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed interest rate risk various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both march and december our eve remained within risk appetite for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios hsbc usa inc net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques march december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve changes in the sensitivities since december have been primarily driven by the addition of payfixed positions and the acceleration of expected mortgage prepayments as a result of the significant drop in interest rates the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts capital risksensitivity of accumulated other comprehensive income loss large movements of interest rates could directly affect some reported capital balances and ratios the marktomarket valuation of availableforsale securities is recorded on a tax effected basis to accumulated other comprehensive income loss this valuation mark is included in two important accounting based capital ratios common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets and total equity to total assets at march we had an availableforsale securities portfolio of approximately million with a positive marktomarket adjustment of million an increase of basis points in interest rates of all maturities would lower the marktomarket by approximately million to a net gain of million with the following results on our capital ratios march december actual proforma actual proforma common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets total equity to total assets proforma
