forbearance initiatives we have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as tdr loans at september due to our election to suspend tdr loan classification under the cares act or their shortterm nature as discussed under the interagency statement in addition under the interagency statement for covid19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral the borrowers past due status will not be impacted during the deferral period and if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the payment deferral is for six months or less for consumer mortgage loans when a borrower requests and is provided with extended relief in the form of a payment deferral of more than six months the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and if the loan does not meet the criteria in the cares act assessed for tdr loan classification we have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance these covid19

exposure in top industries all other industries total commercial credit exposure based on utilization at september excludes commercial credit exposures with affiliates credit risks associated with derivative contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts hsbc usa inc creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules september december in millions risk associated with derivative contracts total credit

exposures in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a fiveyear period hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have elected the fiveyear transition option and as a result beginning in our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the final rule accordingly during and we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on january as well as percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between january and december beginning january the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a threeyear transition period and will be fully reflected at january also in response to the covid19 pandemic the frb issued a final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the slr that permits bank holding companies such as hsbc north america and hsbc usa to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr this change which took effect april will remain in place until march and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households the federal banking agencies have also issued a final rule that permits depository institutions such as hsbc bank usa to exclude temporarily us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr this change took effect june and will remain in place until march we manage capital in accordance with hsbc group policy the hsbc north america internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap works in conjunction with the hsbc groups icaap the hsbc north america icaap applies to hsbc bank usa and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk to the extent that local alternatives are insufficient as a whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc we would seek support from our ultimate parent regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held plus applicable capital buffers as defined by regulations and the amount of riskweighted assets and leverage exposure also calculated based on regulatory definitions we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by us banking regulators including basel iii the basel iii rule under the basel iii rule there are two methods available to calculate riskweighted assets the generallyapplicable standardized approach and the advanced approaches which are required in addition to the standardized approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds in the frb and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act relief act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies bhcs and foreign banking organizations the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each bhc and ihc with billion or more in total us assets into one of five classifications categories i through iv and other firms based on its size and four riskbased indicators under the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to category iii standards and are no longer considered advanced approaches banking organizations however hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to advanced approaches banking organizations including the slr and the countercyclical capital buffer prior to adoption of the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the advanced approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their riskbased capital requirements for credit risk solely under the standardized approach the tailoring rules also permit category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in regulatory capital hsbc usa inc as a result hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa made a onetime election to optout of the requirement to include all components of aoci with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in common equity tier capital effective beginning with march reporting category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries will also benefit from i simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and ii a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties generally known as minority interests which can be included in regulatory capital these simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking finalized by the federal banking agencies in and became effective beginning april as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa implemented both the tailoring rules and the simplifying amendments beginning with march reporting in the federal banking agencies also jointly amended the basel iii rule to implement a provision of the relief act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to highvolatility commercial real estate exposures and also finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk saccr to calculate total riskweighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method cem these changes also became effective beginning april the tailoring rules clarify that category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are not required to use saccr to measure their derivative exposure instead they have the option to use either saccr or cem for their riskbased capital ratios and the slr as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have elected not to use saccr at this time but will continue to evaluate the impact of adopting saccr in the future for additional discussion

the frbs capital plan rule and ccar program as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb and annual companyrun stress tests as required under doddfrank collectively dfast as amended by the relief act under the tailoring rules hsbc north america as a category iii firm is no longer subject to a midcycle stress testing requirement and is now required to disclose its companyrun stress test results only every other year the companyrun stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the frb and internally developed scenarios for the companyrun exercises on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bankholding company over a nine quarter planning horizon in march the frb adopted a final rule on the stress capital buffer scb which will among other things replace the current fixed percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic institutionspecific riskbased scb it is expected that the scb will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on a firms risk exposures and the severity of its stress scenarios under the final rule the scb would be recalibrated annually based on the sum of i a firms projected losses under the severely adverse scenario in supervisory stress tests and ii four quarters of a firms planned future dividends if hsbc north americas riskbased capital ratios were to fall to levels within the scb it would become subject to increasing restrictions on their capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the final rule also eliminates the quantitative objection component of ccar and instead relies on the capital rules automatic restrictions on capital distributions that are triggered if a firm breaches its buffer requirements in august the frb announced the scb requirements for each ccar firm based on supervisory stress testing results conducted as part of ccar the scb requirements became effective october hsbc north america already utilized an internal capital assessment approach that is analogous to the scb and will continue to review the composition of its capital structures and capital buffers in light of the final rule the scb applies only to hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa remain subject to a static percent capital conservation buffer

results in june the frb publicly disclosed its own dfast and ccar results along with aggregated results of a sensitivity analysis aimed at gauging the ongoing economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on ccar firms the frb also announced it is prohibiting stock repurchases by ccar firms and is requiring all ccar firms to limit their common stock dividends to the lesser of a the firms common stock hsbc usa inc dividends last quarter and b the average of the firms net income for the four proceeding calendar quarters the frb has announced that these restrictions will continue at least through december and could be extended in addition each ccar firm including hsbc north america is required to resubmit its capital plan later this year based on additional economic scenarios provided by the frb in september hsbc north america will complete its resubmission by november and any distribution for the fourth quarter remains dependent on the potential extension of distribution restrictions by the frb and the results of the capital plan resubmission assessment stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of hsbc north america capital planning and stress testing for hsbc north america may impact our future capital and liquidity while bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the hsbc north america level and also separately for hsbc bank usa as a bank holding company we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the frb we present our capital ratios together with hsbc bank usas in note retained earnings and regulatory capital requirements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements other regulatory developments frb liquidity facilities the frb announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets addressing

amended to replace certain interest rate provisions or due to technical amendments notional reductions or portfolio compression exercises clarifies the time at which im trading documentation must be in place and adds a new compliance phase for im requirements the amendments in the final rule took effect august which reduced the amount of im we need to collect from many of our affiliates and provided greater clarity around the application of certain aspects of the margin rules funding strategy our current estimate for funding needs and sources for are summarized in the following table

securities net change in trading and other assets total funding needs increase decrease in funding sources net change in deposits net change in trading and other shortterm liabilities net change in longterm debt total funding sources hsbc usa inc reductions to trading assets estimated during the october through december period are mainly related to select fixed income activities which are being consolidated in and operated from europe to better utilize hsbc groups global scale which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet in addition we will also continue to exit certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan as previously discussed the timing of our strategic actions may be resequenced or delayed in light of covid19 we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods the above table reflects a longterm funding strategy daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer

sheet arrangements credit derivatives and other contractual obligations as part of our normal operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and in certain cases guarantees as a financial services provider we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee the following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and offbalance sheet arrangements many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business strategy as described under the heading executive overview business update in our form

right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties hsbc usa inc where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit in addition to the above we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value cnav money market funds that invest in shorterdated highlyrated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment these funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price the funds however are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than basis points from the portfolios market value in that case the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price we do not consolidate the cnav funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the funds assets including interest rate liquidity credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and beginning january certain student loans held for investment as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be hsbc usa inc classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at september and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations assetbacked credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation and at december certain corporate debt securities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional

financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three and nine months ended september and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value during the third quarter of one of our unconsolidated vies was unwound and our investment in the vie along with the related derivatives were terminated our investment in the vie which was a level asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis had a carrying value of million at the time of unwind see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at september the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are hsbc usa inc primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain dealcontingent forward starting interest rate derivatives risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors and the compliance and conduct committee in particular the risk committee of the board of directors advises the board of directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime and fraud risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including both internal and external fraud strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently actual results may differ significantly from model projections the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current covid19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december however during the first nine months of we continued to enhance our risk management by further simplifying our approach and articulation of risk management through combining our enterprise risk management framework and our operational risk management framework to create a single simplified risk management framework credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty as a result of market volatility and economic uncertainty driven by the covid19 hsbc usa inc pandemic we rereviewed the credit ratings assigned to substantially all of our material commercial loans during the first half of during the third quarter of we continued to monitor the performance as conditions evolved and took necessary credit actions where warranted see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk asu process on january we adopted the requirements of asu financial instruments credit losses asu the implementation of asu represents a significant challenge to our risk and finance functions the asu introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ecl some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the ifrs financial instruments ifrs credit loss reporting that we implemented in for segment reporting under the group reporting basis as a result of asu adoption management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which over time may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes the asu process comprises three main areas modeling the risk function had preexisting models developed in conjunction with our ifrs reporting to hsbc these models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of asu such as incorporating forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period reversion to historical losses the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions and lifetime ecl for undrawn credit exposures with the appropriate governance and independent review the models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned implementation a centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ecl calculation the impairment engine receives data which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements from a variety of client finance and risk systems once the lifetime ecl calculation has been performed there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance risk and finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process governance a management review committee has been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ecl calculation the management review committee has representatives from credit risk and finance and is responsible for final approval of our lifetime ecl for the period the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost capital and liquidity risk management we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to capital and liquidity risk capital risk see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a discussion of our approach to capital risk including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy the basel committee based liquidity coverage ratio lcr is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days at both september and december hsbc usas lcr under the european lcr rule exceeded percent a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us lcr rule and are required to report lcr to us regulators on a daily basis the tailoring rules reduced the us lcr requirement for category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa from to percent beginning january as a result under the us lcr rule a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario during the nine months ended september hsbc bank usas lcr under the us lcr rule remained above the percent minimum requirement the european calibration of the basel committee based net stable funding ratio nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities is still pending therefore our calculation of nsfr is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the european calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators the basel nsfr guidance has been interpreted in certain instances to include expected changes from the capital requirements directive and regulation commonly referred to as crr2 our calculation of nsfr will fully follow the crr2 reporting rules when they are expected to become effective in june at both september and december hsbc usas estimated nsfr exceeded percent a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available hsbc usa inc stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in october us regulators issued a final rule to implement the nsfr in the united states applicable to certain large banking organizations including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa consistent with the tailoring rules an percent nsfr requirement will apply to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa when the final rule becomes effective july as a result under the us nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures at both september and december hsbc bank usas estimated nsfr based on our interpretation and understanding of the us nsfr rule exceeded percent as a category iii firm hsbc north america remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules and will continue to evaluate the impact of the final us nsfr rule on our operations our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table reflects the short and longterm credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa at september moodys sp fitch hsbc usa shortterm borrowings p1 a2 f1 longtermsenior debt a2 a a hsbc bank usa shortterm borrowings p1 a1 f1 longtermsenior debt aa3 a aa rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for hsbc the outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the covid19 pandemic while the outlook changed fitch affirmed the longterm credit rating for hsbc usa concurrently fitch upgraded the longterm credit rating for hsbc bank usa by one notch to aa following a review of hsbcs resolution plan in may sp downgraded the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa by one notch following a similar rating action for hsbc the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa were downgraded to a and a2 respectively from a and a1 respectively while the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc bank usa were downgraded to a and a1 respectively from aa and a1 respectively these rating downgrades reflect sps view that the hsbc group will not be fully shielded from the global economic downturn resulting from the measures taken against the spread of covid19 and that weaker earnings arising from higher credit charges will be exacerbated by low interest rates in conjunction with these downgrades sp revised their rating outlooks for hsbc hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to stable from negative while these rating actions by fitch and sp did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any future actions could have such an impact although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at september there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions hsbc usa inc nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading portfolios trading var generates from the global markets unit of the gbm business segment portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products interest rate swaps credit default swaps and precious metals ie gold silver platinum in both north america and emerging markets the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for the nine months ended september foreign exchange and commodity interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at september nine months ended september average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to see two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the nine months ended september we experienced eight loss backtesting exceptions one loss exception in january was mainly driven by palladium volatility five loss exceptions in march and two loss exceptions in april were primarily due to intensified market volatility as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic hsbc usa inc despite the high number of loss exceptions performance of the var model was in line with expectations when considered in the context of the extraordinary market movements observed in march during the period market risk continued to be managed using a complementary set of exposure measures and limits including stress and scenario analysis nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to bsm and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the nine months ended september interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at september nine months ended september average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table above for additional information nontrading var was higher at september as compared with december due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and us government agency credit spreads driven by the covid19 pandemic nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into bsm which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it see below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed interest rate risk various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both september and december our eve remained within risk appetite for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques september december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on october and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on october and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve hsbc usa inc changes in the sensitivities since december have been primarily driven by the addition of payfixed positions and the acceleration of expected mortgage prepayments as a result of the significant drop in interest rates in addition the sensitivities in the downshock scenarios at september reflect no floors to the shocked market rates this is a change from the methodology published in our form 10k where previously market rates would have been floored to zero when applicable however customer product specific rate floors continue to be recognized where appropriate the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts hsbc usa inc
