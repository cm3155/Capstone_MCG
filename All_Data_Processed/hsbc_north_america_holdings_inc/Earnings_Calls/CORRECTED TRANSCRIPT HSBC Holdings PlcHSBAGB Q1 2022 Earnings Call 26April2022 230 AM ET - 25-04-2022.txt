management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analyst conference call for hsbc holdings plcs earnings release for the first quarter for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr ewen stevenson group chief financial officer ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks and good morning in london and good afternoon in hong kong thanks for joining today for our first quarter results ill run quickly through the presentation and then open up for questions at our fullyear results noel and i set out a path back to doubledigit returns strong revenue growth driven by volumes and rising rates and tight cost discipline our strategy to get there is on track all of these building blocks were reflected in our first quarter results strong underlying volume growth across most of our businesses with billion of lending growth and lending up in every global business and region the benefit of rate rises is now being reflected in our net interest margin our net interest margin was up basis points in the quarter our highest quarterly nim since the second quarter of and implied consensus policy rates have further strengthened since fullyear results with further positive implications for our net interest margin and net interest income in and we maintained good cost discipline with adjusted costs down versus first quarter last year in line with our target of keeping costs flat this year and within a to growth hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 range for despite more challenged macro conditions this quarter we remain firmly on track at this point to deliver doubledigit returns in while reported profits before tax were down on last years first quarter this mainly reflected a weaker quarter for wealth driven by a combination of weak markets and hong kong covid restrictions together with a turnaround towards a more normalized level of expected credit losses from net writebacks in first quarter last year on capital with a core tier ratio were now back within our to target range weve completed the billion buyback we announced at our third quarter results and we expect to launch our next billion buyback in early may following our annual general meeting later this week and with the now expected benefit of higher net interest income in this should strengthen our returns outlook and our capacity to fund attractive growth in distributions on the next slide were seeing good momentum across most parts of our franchise reflecting our focus back to areas of competitive strength in wealth and personal banking our underlying insurance business performed well with new business levels equivalent to prepandemic sales and thats despite the closure of the hong kong mainland china border and the impact of covid restrictions on hong kong branch openings and our mortgage franchise continues to underpin good growth in personal banking in commercial banking we saw strong lending growth of billion or versus the fourth quarter with credit and lending up billion and trade balances up billion commercial banking fees were also up the seventh straight quarter of increased fee income in commercial banking we were profitable in all regions including strong performances in the uk ringfenced bank and the middle east you will have already seen our sustainability announcements which we are now working hard to implement and we made further progress in reducing our real estate footprint with a further seven buildings closed in the first quarter our footprint is now down since the end of on the next slide we provided an update on our business in hong kong and mainland china in light of the material covid restrictions that have been in place in both markets in hong kong branch closures and soft markets clearly impacted revenue but we continue to see good sales activity in the quarter underpinned by the increasing shift to digital sales and the investment weve made over recent years to support those our remote sales capability particularly benefited insurance which delivered prepandemic levels of sales volumes despite the branch closures and the continued closure of the mainland china border as weve seen globally with the short cycle of omicron hong kong is now starting to reopen our branches are operating normally again as of last week and we expect client activity to begin to normalize as a result in mainland china we had another solid performance despite the impact of covid restrictions on our own team and more widely revenues were up on last years first quarter lending grew by billion or with the strong commercial banking performances that standout turning to slide ive touched on most of this already adjusted net interest income was up at billion in the quarter reflecting both rate rises and balance sheet growth but nonnet interest income was down mainly due to insurance market impacts and the effects of covid restrictions on asia wealth our tangible net asset value per share was down with profit generation more than offset by fair value movements and the impact of fx turning to revenue on the next slide while wealth and personal banking revenue was down the bulk of those was due to insurance market impacts we had a good personal banking performance revenues up on hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 first quarter last year benefiting from rate rises and balance sheet growth this was offset however by a weaker quarter in wealth with revenues down driven by the impact of weaker markets and hong kong covid restrictions commercial banking revenue was up spread across all our main products with continued good fee income growth glcm and trade were the standout performers glcm up reflecting both higher balances and higher interest rates and trade reflecting continued balance sheet balanced growth while global banking and markets revenue was down this was mainly from lower revaluation gains and principal investments markets and security services revenues were down against the strong first quarter last year underpinned by good performance in fx up global banking was up reflecting our different business mix to many peers with glcm revenues up from higher rates and volumes on slide net interest income was billion up million versus last years first quarter this was mainly driven by higher rates and volumes particularly in wealth and personal banking and commercial banking on right the net interest margin was basis points thats up basis points on the fourth quarter implied consensus policy rates have further strengthened since fullyear results with further positive implications for net interest income in and giving us even greater confidence in achieving doubledigit returns in on the next slide on credit performance weve reported a net charge of million of ecls in the quarter some basis points of average loans the overall quality of our loan book remains good stage loans as a percentage of total loans are stable at the ecl charge includes around million relating to russia exposures and around million relating to china commercial real estate weve released most of our remaining covid19 provisions some million in the quarter this was largely offset by additional reserves of million comprising million of forward economic guidancedriven additional expected credit losses and a million central management provision reflecting a cautious approach given the increased economic uncertainty we continue to expect ecls to normalize towards basis points of average loans for the year turning to slide first quarter adjusted operating costs were down on the same period last year driven by continued cost control and a lower performancerelated pay accrual relative to last years first quarter as in previous quarters we are continuing to invest in technology while reducing other bau costs weve made a further million of cost program savings during the first quarter with costs to achieve spend of around million we remain on track to achieve the higher end of our billion to billion of cost savings over the three years to the end of this year with at least a further billion of cost savings from this program now expected in to reiterate despite a low run rate cost to achieve in the quarter we continue to expect to have total cost to achieve spend of around billion this year which will complete our combined cost to achieve spend of billion when the threeyear program ends in the fourth quarter of this year we remain on track to achieve stable costs this year compared with and we remain committed to keeping underlying cost growth in within a to growth range turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was down basis points on the fourth quarter and back to being within our to target range we flagged the impact of regulatory changes and the unwind of software capitalization benefits at our fullyear results together these reduced our core tier ratio by around hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 basis points in the quarter and the dividend accrual and the announced additional billion buyback accounted for another basis points in addition the steepening of the yield curves on financial assets designated as hold to collect and sell reflected a negative aftertax reserve movements of billion or around basis points which was reflected in other comprehensive income and our core tier reported rwas were up billion on the fourth quarter due largely to regulatory changes and lending growth partly offset by ongoing riskweighted assets sales and fx movements our cumulative rwa sales are now billion were firmly on track to achieve our new ambition of at least billion of cumulative rwa sales by this yearend just as a reminder later this year we expect an impact of around basis points of core tier from the sale of our french retail business which we expect to contribute to us falling below our to target range during the coming quarters but as i said at our fullyear results our intention is to manage within the to range over time weve now completed our billion buyback announced in october and we expect to launch our next billion buyback in early may following our agm later this week as were now at the bottom of our target range due to the impact of fair value market losses and that were continuing to see good expected growth in the business were now unlikely to announce further buybacks during however buybacks remain an integral part of our capital management tool kit going forward so to conclude despite a tougher set of operating conditions this quarter we remain very focused on getting back to doubledigit returns in to achieve this we need to see good volume growth rising rates and cost discipline all of these attributes were there in these results underlying volumes grew in most parts of our business underpinned by lending growth of billion our net interest margin rose basis points for our highest quarterly net interest margin since the second quarter of and costs declined by so despite the macro environment impacting wealth revenues and expected credit losses this quarter the fundamentals of the benefit of rising rates have only strengthened since our fullyear results increasing our confidence in delivering doubledigit returns in and our capacity to fund attractive growth in distributions with that martin if we could please open up for questions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions we will now take our first question today this comes from the line of joseph dickerson of jefferies please go ahead joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi joseph joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi thank you for taking my question just a quick one just on the  noninterest income i mean how much of this is frankly backwardlooking given youve got a lot of market impacts et cetera and it sounds like from your commentary things are starting to pick up in hong kong can we start to see some i guess are you able to recoup some of the lost revenue from things like wealth sales and markets will do what they will but i guess it seems like if most of this is backwardlooking youre set for quite a rebound in noninterest income over the coming quarters just would like your commentary on that please thank you very much ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah joseph thanks i think its a mix so therell be insurance market impacts so obviously yeah that will depend on the performance of markets in the second quarter but we certainly wouldnt are not anticipating the same extent of negative market adjustment that we saw in  yeah there are some line items like equity brokerage the flow business but obviously equity brokerage volumes for us in hong kong were down almost in the quarter we do expect that to normalize back  is normally our strongest quarter but we dont think well recoup the flow business that we lost in  if you look at something like mutual fund sales which in hong kong were down around i think it will be a mix i do think part of that yeah we should recoup in the coming quarters so overall i would yeah i think youll see a decent recovery in    yeah some of what happened in  i think is lost and just remember that  is our strongest quarter normally so you have to seasonalize my comments that ive just made joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thanks very much operator thank you we will now take your next question this comes from the line of aman rakkar of barclays please go ahead hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi good morning aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning two questions if i may one on revenue youre flagging up further net interest income outlook but note that you retained the kind of midsingle digit revenue growth aspiration for this year so just wanted to be exactly clear on to what extent there was an offset in noninterest income is this simply because of the activity impact in hong kong and china and what kind of assumption youre making about on reopening when youre thinking about midsingle digit revenue growth in the second was around fx i think this is something typically consensus struggles to model very well for hsbc and i note that there is a pretty meaningful revenue headwind from fx of about billion based on march offset by million lower costs based on the average fx in march if i was to look at spot fx rates theyre probably even a touch weaker here and particularly for revenues if i was to rebase your revenue for the updated fx and factor in your midsingle digit revenue guide it probably is pointing to revenues around billion consensus is around billion so i mean does that math sound about right to you is there any additional color that youd add to that thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look we do think that well see net interest income growth comfortably in excess of sort of midsingle digits yeah offset by slower nonnet interest income growth particularly given the impacts that weve seen in the first quarter on asia wealth yeah which will hold yeah which will impact noninterest income for the remainder of the year but yeah there will be an fx impact yeah i do think your estimate around billion billion billion is a reasonable estimate of that fx impact roughly split i guess across noninterest income and net interest income your forecast feels a bit light to me actually despite everything ive said about the impact of fx so yeah thats probably all im going to say on yearend forecast aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thats great thank you very much operator thank you your next question today comes from the line of raul sinha of jpmorgan please go ahead raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning ewen thanks very much for taking my questions maybe the first one just focusing a little bit on the nim trajectory and on slide youre again showing a very helpful breakdown and what is interesting here is the uk bank nim actually improved quite significantly quarteronquarter whereas clearly everything else is hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 picking up very nicely as we go along so i guess my question is is there anything specific in terms of repricing youre seeing in the uk to explain that movement and related to the hong kong how should we think about the gap between hibor and libor its about basis points now hibor is obviously lagging the move up in us interest rates how should we think about that impacting the nii trajectory and then unrelated just another followup question if i can on rwa youve obviously had positive credit migration again from asset quality this quarter i was just wondering what you think about the moving parts in rwas for the rest of the year thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay on the nim trajectory in the uk i think theres nothing really to call out in relation to the asset on the asset side continuing pressure as you all know in sort of the uk mortgage market but the main thing youre seeing is the benefit of the two rate rises that had already come through in the quarter and as we talked about yeah deposit beta is being sort of below for the first few rate rises so yeah we continue to think that we will see very material net interest income growth in the uk as policy rates continue to rise over the remainder of the year as we expect in hong kong with hibor consensus is to be the current consensus in our own forecasts at hsbc i think for a basis point rise in fed funds next month and another basis points in june if we get that basis point rate rises come through its very difficult to see how hibor doesnt react so if youd asked me at fullyear results i would have said we could have envisaged a sort of six month lag between hibor and us dollar rates given the shape of us dollar rate rises that were now likely to see being much more frontend loaded i think its hard to see theyre gapping more than one quarter so on riskweighted assets for the remainder of the year yeah in terms of things to call out youve obviously got fx yeah i dont think theres any material rate movement from here to call out youve obviously got the impact of ma to factor through including the french retail bank exit and a few smaller acquisitions that weve made but  was definitely the quarter that we expected to see most of the activity that weve now seen so it will be a much more normalized trajectory i think in the coming quarters raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you thats really helpful i dont know if i can follow up but on regulatory changes last quarter youd called out about a rwa inflation guide for the medium term on regulatory changes and how much of that is remaining just thinking more mediumterm about rwa loss ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean i think at the moment were through most of it yeah you then roll forward to the introduction of basel i guess january maybe were actually thinking that will be a small net benefit to us even further forward by the time were out to we may see the impact of output flows at that point which would be i think unless we adjusted our business model would be a negative at that point but certainly over the next few years i think were through the bulk of it and as i say on january as we currently model we think basel will be a net positive for us hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thats really helpful thank you operator our next question today comes from the line of jason napier of ubs your line is now open jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch good morning ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch thank you for taking my questions two please both on net interest income the first is if we take volume growth over the year and just run it into and then give you about basis points of kind of yield curve moves im getting sort of billion to billion of net interest income consensus is sort of in the billion i take what youre saying about fx but i guess weve all got our opinions on using a deposit beta in the math so is there anything kind of wrong with volumes plus basis points that we should know about sort of structurally as far as the lookforward into next year is concerned and then ive got a second question ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc no i mean well you know i dont like talking about nim and nii forecast jason but look i think reflecting on whats happened over the last couple of months i think the average consensus model was probably updated following our fullyear results in late february since then weve seen very material rate rises coming through in march and april which i dont think is reflected in consensus so our internal forecast the maturity ahead of consensus is they currently sit for net interest income in without commenting on your numbers jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch sure thank you and then the second one perhaps a more useful one from your perspective just in terms of the mechanics of the way that audio gap ive never quite been able to square the billion number even if you are using a deposit even today i find myself even less capable of doing that and ill tell you why the unwind of fvoci is sort of a billion tailwind audio gap period but of course that only relates to billion in bonds and youve got trillion in loans and deposits that match one another i just wonder why the rate gearing isnt substantially more than that if the bond tailwind on its own given whats happened to rates its about billion is there something fundamental that im getting wrong there that you can spot ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah im not sure of your bond tail theres a bond tail i think so the way i think about it is yeah we have a gross and net interest rate exposure we hedge about of our overall net interest income exposure through hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 that bond portfolio that youre referring to which weve just taken the fair market value losses on that doesnt provide us with that incremental billion billion of unwind over the next five quarters we see that benefit in the other of the portfolio and the interest rate sensitivity that we show you is the net interest rate sensitivity not the gross interest rate sensitivity so if we didnt have that portfolio and hedging in place that billion is probably closer to billion or something so the benefit of higher rates that weve seen coming through that has created the fair market value losses the benefit of that higher net interest income we wont see in that portfolio well see in the unhedged of the portfolio that weve given you interest rate sensitivity for i dont know whether that helps or hinders your understanding jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch it does no its very helpful thank you so thats why your year one outlook is billion and your year three four five gets to indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch okay got it thank you operator your next question today comes from the line of ya fei tian of citigroup please go ahead ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd oh thank you i have two questions ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi good morning ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd hi good morning the first one is around the capital market side of the business very resilient quarter because of market volatility just wanted to get a bit of flavor with april volatility coming down a bit how youre thinking about the fixed and the capital market side of the revenue for second quarter and then secondly is to look at slide where you give quite a lot of color on the impact through oci but just wanted to have a better understanding how should we be modeling the coming few quarters at least the potential oci impact that is going to come from the higher rates that were seeing thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 yeah so on global banking and markets and the outlook i mean i guess a few things theres nothing really to call out that surprised us so far in april so very much tracking according to underlying plans at the moment we havent seen any material slowdown going on in our markets franchise monthtodate global banking but i dont know whether its us but our pipeline continues to look pretty robust and has been pretty resilient probably in part we are less exposed to the us ma and ipo markets and some of the other markets that we are exposed to like the middle east have been outperforming for us the other thing i would note in our global banking and markets franchise is a lot of the revenue line items are interest rate sensitive so security services glcm gtrf they should outperform on the back of this better rates environment which will help cushion if there was any weakness that we saw in some of the sort of more traditional investment banking lines and market lines that you would compare with peers and i do think were continuing to operate in an environment with higher levels of fx volatility which again should benefit our fx franchise on oci i think the only thing to call out is if you take the monthtodate adjustment on the treasury portfolio theres about an additional billion pretax of fair value losses which would obviously run through oci in april ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd sorry will there be anything additional to that billion or when we think about it ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well i mean that ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc very much depends on the forward curve of interest rates from here over the remainder of the quarter if they didnt move it would be about billion if they do move it will adjust up and down but just to give you some sense of sensitivity and please take this as a very broad and basic sensitivity but every approximately basis points of higher rates across the curve adds about billion of additional fair value losses and the reverse of that also being true ie if they were basis points lower that fair value loss would come in by about billion ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd got it ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so i think that will give you enough to model over the quarter depending on where interest rates are relative to today hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd got it but how many quarters does that last so lets say if rates curve stabilize and i guess from that point onwards will there be any benefits that we should be thinking about once interest rates stabilize at certain level from higher treasury returns or should we just take that into account from the net interest income sensitivity you have provided ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc no therell be no latent oneoff gain or loss at that point and then effectively youll see the benefit of wherever those rates stabilize come through in net interest income and the net interest margin over time ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd got it thank you so much operator our next question today comes from the line of omar keenan of credit suisse please go ahead omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning everybody thank you very much for taking the questions so as was commented earlier market expectations for policy rates have moved up since the full year so appreciate the sensitivity thats been given on for the year one and year five can i perhaps just ask about how youre thinking about things in terms of the net interest margin if we think about i think the fed funds rate peaked out at about and nims were quite close to i think they were over the year has anything changed in terms of the balance sheet structure that would mean that just in terms of fence checking that wouldnt be achievable again or is that a sort of good target to think about and just on a related question to rates could i ask if youre thinking more over the mediumterm how comfortable are you that the through the cycle basis points loan loss guidance is right for a world where policy rates are close to so i guess the crux of the question though is to try and understand where the negatives from higher rates might offset the positive than if that inflection rate is substantially higher above thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes i mean whats changed since i mean firstly the balance sheet is materially bigger so average interestearning assets have gone up materially so on a rate by volume basis we should be earning higher net interest income if we return to previous nim levels the other thing is i think the marketimplied rates particularly in some markets are actually higher than so yeah we certainly expect to see a very strong recovery back in nim as you model it through maybe in some markets that gets you back to higher levels of nim in different currencies than you had previously and the balance sheets larger hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 on the negative impacts of higher rates look theres a few things i mean firstly on costs the higher rates reflects higher inflation if you looked at our fixed pay increases this year they were more than double the fixed pay increases that we put through in or the year before so we do think were managing to offset that inflation at the moment by additional cost saves and weve committed and continue to commit to flat costs this year and keeping cost growth within a to range next year the higher end of that range reflects very much the impact that were seeing of inflation now on ecls i think rates need to go up materially higher than what are currently being were currently seeing in forward rate curves remember were starting from decades or century lows in terms of the start of this rate cycle so we do think that would have to go up materially further than what we currently see implied so just as a reminder weve said to basis points during the cycle not basis points look and we continue to be comfortable with our guidance omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you very much operator our next question today comes from the line of tom rayner of numis your line is now open tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good morning ewen could you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd maybe sort of talk us hi talk us through in a bit more detail the sort of the impact of these oci movements on the capital ratio and how you might expect that to the impact to reverse over the next four to six quarters because i guess my concern is that consensus forecasts may have already factored in the benefits of higher interest rates based on your sensitivity disclosures and the forward curve but not factored in the negative impacts that youre now flagging on the capital ratio so is there a danger that consensus sort of the equity tier ratio versus consensus nim might be somehow out of line and if you could maybe talk us through that please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so on oci movement yeah as weve talked about today that would be about another billion pretax movement in april based on how rates are strengthened further in april and yeah there was a sort of multiplicative effect on our threshold deductions as core tier declines then you also i think youll see in the numbers theres also sort of a meaningful chunk of core tier impairment thats come through as a result of the reduction in core tier and the impact that has on threshold deductions together with the increases weve seen in bocom and now the acquisition of axa singapore hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 rolling forward its not the unwind of just to repeat what i was saying with jason its not the unwind of the fair value losses that benefits net interest income and capital its the impact of those higher rates on the of the book roughly thats not hedged and therefore we expect it will take about five quarters for that higher net interest income to get us back to the same place we dont think as ive said earlier that the implied rate rises that weve seen coming through in march and april are reflected in consensus if we look at our internal numbers theyre materially ahead of consensus for based on the latest rate curves so i think what you will see therefore as that translates into core tier is you should get back to the same point on core tier sometime next year but in the nearterm where well weve had the basis point impact from the fair value losses weve had through first quarter weve got about another basis points if you adjust for fair value losses in april or just under basis points we will recoup that through higher net interest income over the following five quarters so there will be a timing mismatch on capital its that timing mismatch on capital which causes us to say today that we think it is now unlikely that we will do further buybacks in the second half of this year but the reverse of that should be much higher net interest income much higher returns much higher distribution capacity in and beyond tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah okay netnet though if you are putting through net interest income based on future rate movements we have to consider the capital implications of those rate movements as well is that fair ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so i think tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc if i looked at consensus today well it hasnt reflected it hadnt reflected the impact of the fair value losses on capital equally it hadnt reflected the benefit of those interest rate rises on net interest income over time tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah okay could i just ask a second just very quick one just on  ecl numbers because obviously theres lots of moving parts here and i guess the provisions youve taken of russia and the china cre reflect everything that you expects at this moment in time so you wont expect i guess to be taking similar provisions for those issues and with the economic uncertainty as well there was a charge in there i think maybe thats just a change in assumptions but these are things which we can look at as sort of  noise and really going forward we should think more about the underlying sort of a run rate charge that youve flagged that you expect this year ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 yeah well so for russia i would say weve obviously spent a lot of time in our russia exposure weve been able to do a pretty good estimate of where we think losses will come through we think that million charge weve taken for russia is a good estimate of what we can see today so something dramatic would have to change in relation to the russiaukraine war or our position on our russian subsidiary to get to a different outcome to what weve announced today on the millionodd of china commercial real estate yeah i would not make the same statement at that yeah youve got a very fluid situation in the china commercial real estate sector theres been two big factors going on one has been policy tightening that we saw at the back end of last year that started to get unwound at the beginning part of this year that created a liquidity squeeze that has now eased substantially but the underlying credit conditions of the china commercial real estate markets continue to be weak we did see a number of small names go into defaults this quarter the million charge was a mix of stage and its down materially from the billion or so that we took in  but i wouldnt say yeah it would be a big call tom to say that was in relation to the remaining provisions required from the china commercial real estate market but were not anticipating it will be a material number and it is contained within the guidance that weve given for fullyear provisions so yeah that statement is that we expect to trend towards basis points of ecl provisions this year  was basis points tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah clear okay lovely thanks a lot operator our next question today comes from the line of ed firth of kbw your line is now open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi ed edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods yes good morning ewen yeah hi i just had two questions both on cost really one was back to the cost to achieve charge youre obviously running well below that and or the annualized rate i guess i know the expectation i get what youre saying that the expectation is to pick up in the rest of the year but in the past if you havent spent the money you then roll it forward into the next year so should we be expecting that as the sort of the core scenario is that the way we should be thinking about it as we look over the rest of this year and i guess thats the first question and then the second point is if i look at your cost guidance its flat this year and flat to next year i mean that is quite markedly different from a number of other global banks who are talking about the need for additional investment particularly digital and payments et cetera et cetera and im just wondering why that is so i mean do you feel that you were overinvesting in the past and therefore you now you know you can bring it back a bit or are they doing stuff that youre not doing or why is that sort of that difference in terms of the cost ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay so look on the first one you shouldnt think of the program drifting into we have a boardapproved program that expires at the end of this year we will spend the remaining billion so i think it is between now hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 and the end of the year and if we dont we lose it so our intention is to spend that money we think it is sensible to spend the money because we can drive up incremental cost savings and that thinking is factored into our confidence in keeping cost growth to to next year so yeah our current intention is that we will run very close to spending that billion for the remainder of the year so if you dont see it coming in next quarter just assume im making exactly the same comment when we get to interim results about the flowthrough into the second half on the cost program maybe i should say thanks yeah ive run the cost program so look i cant comment on other banks but look i think whats clear here is that noel topdown is very very committed to delivering on the targets that weve announced to the market yeah weve got very detailed plans in relation to achieving the flat costs for this year i would say for next year we need to find about an incremental cost savings of about billion we are working hard on that at the moment we expect to have that solutioned by the time that we get to interim results at the beginning of august and that sort of cost gap is not unusual relative to previous guidance that weve given for future years at this time of the year were well developed across a number of work streams and identifying areas that we can strip out of incremental cost so yeah i would say the cost management here is being transformed over recent years and you can see that in terms of the overall cost trajectory that weve had from onwards where we broadly kept costs flat now so through edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods yeah okay just thinking that with given the inflationary environment thats obviously a much youre actually improving your cost savings and rather than holding it flat ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah no we understand that and thats why weve got a degree of a range for next year consistent with that edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods great thanks very much operator our next question today comes from the line of guy stebbings of bnp paribas your line is now open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi guy guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi morning morning ewen most of my questions been asked and answered so just a couple on capitals followup could you expand on the hit from the threshold deductions in  i recognize some of it was simply a reflection of moving the equity base itself but how much is residual stuff and was it particularly indiscernible for bocom treatment should we worry about a similar move in the future or actually might we see a partial reversal if bocom dividends sort of come through hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 and then on capital longer term and i suppose youd be able to quantify the helpful commentary on basel expected to be a net positive now indiscernible talking lowsingle digit percentages drop in rwas sort of that sort of magnitude any additional color thered be very helpful thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so in terms of the increase in threshold deductions about billion of it comes from the growth in the value of investments in axa which is about million and bocom which is about million and then theres about million is due to the threshold being lower because weve got a lower core tier ratio which is as a result of the fair value losses the loss of core tier treatment for software intangibles the dividend accrual and the billion share buyback i would take it from all of the comments weve been saying today we think were back into a cycle of much higher returns which should drive continued core tier improvement and therefore help mitigate some of the impacts that weve seen this quarter what was the second question the second question guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas so the second question was ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so yeah as we said we think in well see a modest benefit from but modest from the introduction of basel reform almost entirely driven by the fact that weve taken most of the impacts upfront including in this quarter so i do think over the next couple of years youll see a much cleaner rwa trajectory for us with the only thing to pay attention to which well need to give you color on is the impact of ma both buy side and sell side guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay thank you operator our next question today comes from the line of manus costello of autonomous please go ahead your line is now open manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp morning ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp i wanted to ask about the macro situation please because there are some negative macro signals coming out of china weve got lockdowns the fx is volatile the yield premium to the us has disappeared now but you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 seem to remain quite confident in the outlook and havent really tempered that enthusiasm much i just wondered if you could give us more color on why you arent more worried about the way china is developing at the moment or whether i misread what your comments were ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah no i mean they were probably i mean as you know as we think about greater china i mean the impact on hong kong is a far more dominant driver of what happens to us and we are confident that a combination in hong kong a combination of the market reopening as lockdown restrictions get lifted together and importantly the likelihood that were seeing material movements in hibor in the coming quarters will mean that well see a strong recovery in hong kong earnings in mainland china itself i think it reflects a few things firstly just an observation that despite being the biggest bank in china we are small we have biggest foreign bank in china we have less than a market share if you look last year we grew the loan book by which was far in excess of underlying gdp growth so our ability to grow the loan book is not as correlated to underlying economic growth if we were a big lender as we are in hong kong so yeah we are somewhat insulated to some extent i think with pinnacle again our life insurance venture were continuing actually to see very good traction in that business and see nothing in relation to whats happening that would cause us to slowdown the plans for that business we also have a lot of revenue connected with trade in china and somewhat perversely if theres a disruption in supply lines it means people are going to run bigger trade balances with us as weve seen in our overall trade franchise with the disruption in supply lines so again youve got a number of things in our book which were not a perfect yeah its different in the uk in hong kong manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp sure ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc we very much track macro in a market like china where its much more micro manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay that makes sense thank you can i just ask a very quick followup on nii as well just because you commented that youre expecting rate hikes to come through more quickly and hibor to therefore rise more quickly than previously at what point do the mortgage caps in hong kong kick in and how material might that be if the rate hikes are coming sooner and larger does that mean that we hit the cap sooner and therefore nii benefits flatten out quicker ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah ill get our investor relations team to followup manus but i think its around basis points is where it stops to have an impact on nii growth but ill get our investor relations team to followup hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you very much operator thank you we will now take our last question today from the line of martin leitgeb of goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international hi thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international good morning ewen thank you for taking my question i have just two questions please one on uk nim and a followup on capital and the reporting on hsbc uk bank plc shows that nim increased increase by basis points to and i was just wondering if you could share your thinking on the phasing of rate benefits coming through in the uk to what extent does hedging delay the impact because it seems like from the increase you had in the first quarter that hedging is comparatively a smaller part of the rate sensitivity if you like and that actually a good part of the rate sensitivity comes through quite quickly would you be able to share how big the structure hedges in the uk ringfence so to get a better sense on phasing of any further rate hikes on the pl and on capital i was just wondering the leverage ratio is up meaningful in the quarter following obviously the changes does that impact how you see certain businesses which have a low risk weighting and a comparatively high asset weight say trade finance repo is there more opportunity to engage stronger in some of these business lines thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on the second one martin i think thats a very complex question that you need to drive down into the individual legal entities because were sort of relatively unique in that we dont have a single balance sheet if you look at the average peer probably 70plus percent of their assets are within a single balance sheet whereas for us i dont think a single balance sheet is more than about of our total balance sheet so where leverage constraints capital constraints stress constraints impact is an entity by entity discussion but i dont think fundamentally anythings changed our strategy in any of those legal entities over the last one to two quarters on uk nim i think we are hedged lower to much lower than some other banks we also have i think higher levels of liquidity and shortdated liquid assets so i do think we probably have more interest rate sensitivity than peers but without commenting on their interest rate sensitivity so as you saw in our disclosures at full year sterling is our most sensitive currency and we do think what were seeing in terms of rate rises therefore should correspond to very material net interest income growth not only in the ringfenced bank but also in the nonring fenced bank that has exposure to sterling interest rate sensitivity hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international very clear thank you very much operator there are no more further questions at this time back to you ewen ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay well look thank you everyone joining appreciate the discussion and look forward to catching up with you at interim results if you do have any
