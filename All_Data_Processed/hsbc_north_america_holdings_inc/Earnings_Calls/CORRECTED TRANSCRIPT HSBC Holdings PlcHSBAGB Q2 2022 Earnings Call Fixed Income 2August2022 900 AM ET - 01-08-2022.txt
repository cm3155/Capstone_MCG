management discussion section abrupt start carlo pellerani group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc and im joined by richard oconnor our global head of investor relations who is actually in hong kong and greg case head of debt investor relation sic head of fixed income investor relations who is with me in london ill start by mentioning a couple of highlights from the results then ill do a quick update as usual on financial resources and then straight into qa i will not be referring to any slides as i go through so three highlights from the results first of all rote for the half year largely driven by higher nii and good cost control more than offsetting a higher ecl charge importantly we are now expecting to improve our rote to above in which is well ahead of our cost of capital second in terms of balance sheet dynamics billion of adjusted loan growth in the half year largely in mortgages and trade alongside billion growth in adjusted deposits and lastly on the results credit quality remains quite good ecl charges equivalent to basis point of gross loans for the half year stage loans stable at of total loans and we are flagging that despite the fact that our early warnings indicators are not yet showing any signs of stress we have an expectation for ecl charge to normalize towards basis points in onto financial resources lets start with capital our cet1 ratio was which was down from at the end of the year the reduction mainly driven by timing differences in fair value oci securities and some rwa hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 growth we remain percentage points above our mda hurdle although we are below our target operating range of to we expect that cet1 ratio to trough in  given headwinds that we have previously mentioned on the sale of our french retail business and some other ma that is completing and we expect strong earnings and management actions will help us lift the capital back into our target range during the first half of next year in terms of liquidity it remains strong most importantly at a legal entity level but also you can see that in the overall group lcr ratio of and we still have an hqla on a gross level of about billion we have a loan to deposit ratio at which positions us quite quite well actually in the current rising rate environment our mrel ratio compares favorably to our requirement which as you will see is still the sum of the parts calculation we intend to continue to operate a prudent buffer over that minimum from a funding perspective now we have made good progress in this year in lets call them interesting markets we have issued billion of senior holdco and billion of tier as you will have seen in our deck we have now increased our funding plan for the year by about billion in senior holdco and billion in tier which positions us kind of halfway through the overall funding plan at this point the reason for the increase in the funding plan is to offset negative market moves that we have seen that impact the liability value of our red bonds just to flag that that impact over time will unwind as those bonds pull to par and as a consequence of course were expecting that this will reduce funding needs in future years all else equal as mentioned at the full year we continue to expect not to refinance any at1 calls that we may look to make in im pleased to just have announced literally before this call an exchange offer targeting some of our older legacy securities issued by our holding company you will find an overview of the transaction that is being included any second in our updated fixed income deck on the website the transaction is a parforpar exchange which is the most logical structure given the practical challenges that exist with consent solicitation indiscernible law and we plan to use exchange accounting which minimizes the cost of the exercise for us having said that were also offering a incentive payment in order to encourage everyones participation just to close on legacy capital as im sure there will be some more questions about it i just want to remind everyone of our position on those we are aligned with the bank of england in our commitment to reducing the stack over time however doing so ph can accommodate at at any cost were willing to take some cost to exit those position but as we have flagged in the past we have made some historical hedging and accounting decisions that make the economics of taking lets say the full stack not really currently feasible or rational so we will continue to monitor the portfolio and if further opportunities arise we will take them so in summary a strong half year result with a clear path to solidly returning above cost of capital our financial resources of capital funding and liquidity leave us all wellplaced to continue growing our business model continues to offer bond holders one of the most diverse sets of revenue streams in global banking thats what i thought of saying so ill stop here and lets open up for qa ill hand over to greg hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 question and answer section greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks carlo yeah hi everyone so well be taking questions over zoom so a little different to our previous set up operator instructions so ill just leave it a minute on and let some of the questions come through and so our first question comes from dan david of autonomous dan your lines open daniel david q analyst autonomous research hey greg and carlo richard thanks for doing the call and taking my questions ive got a couple the first one is just on insurance plans for this year so i hear you on no new at1 issuance for potential refinancing this year however i guess im looking out to next year and i think youve got quite a heavy potential call schedule so would you look to at1 markets this year to potentially get ahead of your refinancing needs next year and then secondly as expected a few questions on legacy so ive yet to see the details of the exchange but welcome that and i hear your comments on the raf and where were headed id just like to drill down on that a bit more and i realize youre probably limited in what you can say im just interested by what the pra have told you if theyve given you targets to reduce by an amount per year and then also just on the reasonable economics point does that and i heard your comments on taking a small cet1 cost did you need to get back to your kind of cet1 target range before you can take cet1 costs as a result of potential legacy calls or lmes and also if you can give us any guidance as to what is reasonable that would be really interesting thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc hi dan thanks for your questions so on at1 first this year was a transition year you might remember that we mentioned that we were overweight at at1 and underweight tier so this year was rebalancing with the actions that were taking this year that pretty much brings us in line so going forward its all about maintenance and refinancing and yes to your point it is always a possibility to try to prefinance some of the potential call for next year so that is something that we would leave open market conditions dependent in terms of the legacy stack no we havent had specific targets from pra or bank of england indiscernible has been just more a generic discussion the way i would characterize it which is that kind of everyone would rather not have those securities outstanding because theyre a little bit of a its a nuisance to have those securities outstanding from a resolvability perspective and to give you some guidance in terms of cost i guess the best i can do is to give you a sense of how i think about those securities and the way i would describe them is there are two dimensions to the equation the first one is how challenging each of the securities are from a resolution perspective and there is a pecking order on those securities so i would call out that our securities for the from the holding companies were the ones that the most complex from a resolution perspective because theyre issued from the holdings company they do not hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 have the contractual recognition of the bank of england bearing powers and hence they create these potential infection risk so the way were dealing with those is clearly with the exchange and then to voluntarily derecognize from but then you go from that point on and then the rest of the entities still challenged but theyre less problematic than i guess from a holdings from the ones from holding and then you have the other dimension which is the cost and that dimension is driven by what is the accounting and hedging arrangement that we have on those bonds whether they have significant optionality value and so on and so forth so when you put those two dimensions together you end up with a pecking order which is broadly as follows the first is the holdings company securities then is the subsidiary securities that are fixed rate instruments then you have the floating rate securities and maybe lastly you have the legacy tier securities so obviously we are announcing today an exchange for the holdings securities we will continue to assess oneonone all the other securities to assess their economics but that hopefully give you a little bit of a guidance of how we are thinking about it daniel david q analyst autonomous research thanks for that can i just ask on the legacy tier coming bottom of the list that more because of cost rather than kind of the problems they pose carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc predominantly i would also say that some of those securities we are able to bail in the guarantee on the securities so technically it is executable there is some complexity but its executable but yes you can assume that given that those securities have been outstanding for a while and we havent called them that the economics are not particularly attractive daniel david q analyst autonomous research okay ive probably taken too much of your time but thank you for that it was really helpful carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks dan next question comes from ellie dann from morgan stanley ellie your lines open ellie dann q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi there thanks for taking my question my questions regarding the upcoming at1 call so thats the five and onequarter in september of this year which has not yet been prefinanced considering youve got no plans to issue at1 this year i was wondering what your thoughts are on this call i know that youre well above your efficient level of at1 in terms of mda in excess of about billion so i assume my assumption would be that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 the supervisor would allow you to call this bond if you wished without refinancing interested to hear your thoughts carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yes hi ellie thanks for the question we have no impediment in calling that from a regulatory perspective to your point we are as usual in the middle of the call period so well take advantage of that period we havent announced anything todate but you shouldnt read anything into that we will continue to assess and we will make an announcement when that is appropriate ellie dann q analyst morgan stanley co international plc okay thanks greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc great thanks ellie we got a few questions in from richard thomas at bank of america let me just read one out so richard asks about the ping an situation and people are asking a little bit him about the potential for hsbc to be broken up i was wondering if you could just maybe run through a summary of hsbcs current views carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc richard oconnor why dont you take that you are wellversed after this week richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yes thanks carlo and good afternoon everyone look indiscernible you saw the call yesterday morning we continue to engage with all our shareholders on all the process for enhancing shareholder value and we made a number of announcements yesterday which we intend to do that including some very firm dividend return announcement and we think that the strategy is definitely working were not going to talk about individual shareholder discussions on any call but i think we set out very clearly yesterday on the slides some of the issues which were leaked in the press and at this stage we dont see that theres value to those proposals versus a very clear what you might call planning strategy to improve returns improve dividends obviously improve capitalization over the coming courses and indeed years so we continue to engage with all shareholders we had a further meeting today in hong kong with our retail share shareholders and the same issues were discussed there as they were yesterday in the call yesterday so i dont think theres anything further richard to discuss over and above what was discussed yesterday greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks richard and another one from richard thomas before we move back to the phones so probably one for you carlo on legacy richard says that few of his clients have pointed out to him that weve changed our stance on legacies between yearend and now and is that your sense of things how do you think our messaging has evolved over the course of this year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc no i wouldnt say that we have changed our stance its pretty much the same that it was at that point which is it is a combination as we have said in the past of what is the complexity from a resolvability perspective and a cost so i would just say that were just providing further clarity on that and pleased that were making steps with the technical difficulty greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks carlo next question comes from robert smalley rob your line is open please go ahead robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my question and thanks for doing the call on the call yesterday it was mentioned that you did a study of potential impact of a downgrade and you thought it would be to basis points across the liability stack could you talk about what went into that and how you came to that conclusion thats first question second as you went over your review mrel tier et cetera did anything else come out in terms of efficiency now that youve scrubbed down everything should we look for any changes in your npe strategy funding strategy of the subsidiaries et cetera and then third with an increase in dividends its very clear that your equity holders enjoy a dividend and really a lot of them depend on a dividend from the stock particularly retirees could you talk about any potential tension between increasing the dividend and the needs and desires of debtholders to ensure that their debt will continue to be covered particularly as liability stacks becomes more expensive thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks for those questions rob maybe ill ask greg to cover the first question on the cost of that debt stack greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure hi rob so the analysis is effectively based around the fact that if you take a hypothetical split of the group and you split the asia business away from the rest of the group then that kind of call lets call it rest of world co rest of world co versus its peers at its current rating arguably isnt sustainable so youre arguably a notch or two lower than current ratings today when you look at the peer group so when we look across not just the debt liabilities but also the broader funding base of that group that does currently benefit from a ratings premium thats the kind of funding differential that we thought could filter through carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc so on your second question on efficiency i mean we have looked as deep as possible technical difficulty into the questions that were posed and the potential options we havent found opportunities for efficiencies its naturally when you hold a group together versus separating that there are some natural these synergies and inefficiencies around it and thats really what dominates the analysis that we described yesterday and that richard just highlighted hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 in terms of your third question on the tradeoff of the reliance on dividends and the overall capital management i think it was last year when we changed our capital policy historically we used to have a fixed dividend component and what we have made now is a payout which is linked with the profitability of the group so we think that that is a sensible way of balancing all of these requirements so to the extent that the company is highly generative then our dividends will increase to the extent that it isnt they will decrease so it creates like a natural stabilizer that we think is the probably the best way of balancing all that richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc and carlo let me just add to that that look clearly in the second half of the year we very fully intend to get back between to range as carlo said the previous dividend policy was a fixed policy which didnt really cover earnings and growth appropriately we think this policy does do that and it does allow for and if we can achieve our return target of plus the group will be substantially cash flow generative and theyll be therell be a good a good policy to give dividends back to fund growth but also to ensure that our debt holders have a very solid level of capitalization and liquidity and very solid in funding liquidity which and very conservative hsbc stance and we fully commit to that today robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the complete answer and thanks for doing the call greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks for your questions rob so the next question comes from the line robert thomas rob your line is open q hi thanks for taking the call question i just had a question on how youre thinking about calls on not just tier but also part of your senior stack i mean i think looking at the markets right now theres a lot of extension risk priced into even some of the senior mrel bonds and i just wanted to see if you could walk us through how you assess determining economic value in those call and if you were looking at possibly letting those go out to maturity how do you assess what the value of that extension would be is it a simply a part of your liquidity then or would you need to then replace it with mrel carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc hi hi robert thanks thanks for the question so for senior debt the call period that we have is really really short so those calls are designed to optimize the treatment of those securities from an mrel perspective and to basically being able to reduce if you want the balance sheet when its no longer effective so the intention for all those is to call them right for all the mrel transactions thats the intention obviously it is not something we would guarantee but it is not designed to be valuable for us to call them so thats what i would say in terms of the seniors hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 q thank you thanks so much greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc great thanks rob and weve got a question coming in from ph phil pila at deccan phil your lines open q yeah hello everyone carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yes we can hear you hi there q great thanks for taking the call making the call and thanks for taking my question i got two the first of all is on your china real estate exposure i am i wondered a little bit that the i mean you took some provisions this quarter but do you think this will be sufficient for the long run and the other point is in terms of issuing new senior bonds which currencies would you prefer at the moment do you just look which currency would be cheapest or are other factors playing a role as well thank you carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc hi ph phil thanks for the questions richard do you want to cover china real estate please richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yes thanks and again we covered it yesterday but ill just add a few additional comments well as you know the that sector came under stress from the second half of last year and weve taken cumulatively around million of provisions on average million of sorry million of provision the firsthalf of the year about million each quarter as some mediumsized developers go into stage so its fair to say that sectors obviously going through some issues at the moment however the chinese authorities are trying to stabilize the issue in terms of developments and looking at the bailout fund or a fund of that nature our sense is that weve taken the appropriate provisions at this stage when you look in the second half we do think that within our ecl guidance which we gave yesterday of towards basis points for the full year there will be further charges from chinas cre as that impairment issue matures probably of the same nature we saw in the first half million or even slightly more and indeed if indiscernible gets into further issues then clearly theres maybe million on top of that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 so we do think its an issue which will be ongoing we think its very much controllable from a group perspective given its a relatively small part of the groups loans and advances the offshore book is about billion or really only about of the groups loans and advances i think the authorities in china are trying to stabilize their position but clearly there will be i think further developments in the second half of the year and thats really our guidance at this stage central case is for some further provisions of about the same magnitude in the first half or maybe slightly more were watchful were managing the situation very carefully and i think the chinese authorities will resolve it but i think itll take some time i think this is will take some time to resolve over the coming year or two so ive given you some nearterm guidance and lets see how we get on from there carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc and ph phil for your second question i mean ideally we would try to match the issuances to our natural currencies because that avoids some of the volatility in the capital stack that you have seen this quarter for example so we have about 51orso percent of our rwas are in dollars or ph pac currencies then the next one down is sterling which is about and then the remaining third in a combination of all the other currencies so that would be kind of the dream treasurers approach unfortunately the market is not quite there the market is predominantly a dollar market so invariably what we try to do is we try to take pressure off the dollar markets and try to diversify as much as possible and we look largely at that in a currencyagnostic fashion so we always are keen to try to diversify so this year what we have done is we have done swissy and sing dollars in addition to euros and dollars last year we did cnh ph hongkies and also swissy so we try to diversify away from dollars but invariably given the large funding pool in the us we end up doing more in the us than proportion that we want to greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks ph phil and next question comes from the line of james hyde at pgim james your lines open james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd hi i hope you can hear me first question is i just want to have some more color on the riskweighted asset reduction measures for h2 i understand france closing of disposal is one but what other is it about continuing this more collateral taking is it more about offloading clients that dont meet roe targets and i mean and i rather thought this was ongoing and im just wondering so how are you going to accelerate this which was the impression i got from the call secondly i see from at least the bloomberg share register there are a few more chinese institutions in there and i just wonder if you beyond ping an have any chinese institutions openly given support to current strategy thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks thanks james so to your point the rwa approach is one that is dynamic ie we look at it all the time given the temporary nature that the temporary depression lets call it that we have seen on the cet1 hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 ratio we have decided to accelerate some of those and the focus is really on less profitable less franchise clients alongside potentially some hedging opportunities that we have on some of the rwa so that is the bulk of the actions that we are looking at at the moment in terms of the chinese institutions richard do you want to cover that richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yes i would hi jim theres a limit to what i can say because obviously shareholder register whilst its public obviously im not going to talk about individual shareholder positions you wouldnt expect me to overall what i would observe is clearly theres the hong kongshanghai stock connect and you have daily data on that and you can see that the vast majority of that position when you look at the ping an filings is the ping an position is not just ping an when you do the maths theres a couple of other institutions there whove taken advantage of that stock connect to obviously invest in hong kong and our hong kong stock which we obviously is very much welcome but more generally when you go for the shareholder register on the bloomberg register then you will see a very large number of institutions in china and asia on that register and we very much welcome that and the clearly we are duallisted in both hong kong and the uk and were a key member of the hang seng index and therefore we welcome asian institutions including mainland china institutions and hong kong institutions on our share register and indeed part of the success of hong kong over the last few years has been the massive growth in the asset management industry in hong kong there are well over to mainland china parent company asset managers now based in hong kong invest in the city invest internationally and invest in hsbc so jim i wouldnt take it any more or less than that very much its something which we very much welcome we very much welcome the internationalization of the china asset management industry investing internationally and being part of our share register so ill take it in that spirit please james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd okay thanks richard just another one for carlo i sort of im bit surprised about the extent to which the market value of your liabilities affects mrel because from an accounting perspective i mean its theres it a lot of it is amortized cost so i just wondered is it currency more than anything else thats caused the stepped up issuance rather than actual fair value or spreadrelated fair value carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yes jim i mean first of all the impact the impact over the quarter was about billion about billion of that was interest rate and about billion of that was fx so it was a combination of both it is a curiosity of mrel valuation in which regardless of the accounting treatment you de facto from an mrel perspective you fair value it as a whole and regardless of the way you are hedging it as well because the hedges that you may take from an interest rate perspective are not bailinable from a mrel perspective so what you do is you determine how much capital you would be able to generate when you bailin those securities and that is the fair value at the moment thats why it is exaggerated and thats why perhaps is more is larger than you would have thought hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 02aug2022 james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd oh thanks carlo thats really instructive i didnt realize that thanks thats it for me thanks greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay thanks jim just a quick opportunity for anyone any last people to raise their hands for questions ill just give it another few seconds richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc greg just saying we got a chat qa on does the 30basispoint cost of risk take into account the chinese real estate indiscernible positive what i would say is that our guidance for is towards basis points and yes it does take into account our central view on issues in the china commercial real estate market so just cover that one indiscernible qa greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks richard and weve got another question from ph olivia ducan from citi ph olivia your line is open ph olivia okay technical difficulties there i think i guess with that i think were out of questions so ill hand back to carlo carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yes yes richard so and greg i was just asked to clarify my answer to the accounting treatment so greg why dont you have a go because i think i said more than more and perhaps i confused things a little bit more so greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah so jim the on the bond so while if you do put a bond in an amortized cost relationship if you put a hedge on it then its in a fair value hedge relationship and what you do then is youll fair value the bond from an accounting perspective for rate moves and as you can imagine when rates go up the bond liability value goes down thats reflected in mrel from an accounting perspective then the swap liability of course goes up by the same amount so you dont get a capital benefit but the swap of course isnt bailinable so it doesnt benefit your mrel so thats the that is effectively the mechanics carlo pellerani group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc okay thank you i mean thanks everyone for joining today i hope the call was useful for all of you if you have any further questions please pick it up with greg and the ir team and you will see updated materials on the web with the information about the exchange thanks very much until next time
