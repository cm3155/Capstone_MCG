good afternoon in hong kong ive got ewen with me today and ill hand over to him shortly to go through the detail of our  performance first though ill start with a summary of the key highlights our progress against our transformation plans and in particular what were seeing with respect to growth for the second quarter a good operating performance supported by a net release of expected credit losses delivered reported pretax profits of billion up billion on last years second quarter we saw a return to profitability in all our regions in the first half including good performances in both europe and the us our uk business performed well with a record quarter for mortgages in  weve generated good momentum behind our growth and transformation plans and made important decisions on exiting our mass market retail business in the us and our retail business in france our rwa and cost reduction programs are both on track our asia wealth strategy is gaining traction with strong growth in wealth balances were seeing promising signs of early growth in both lending volumes and fee income hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 particularly in asia and we retained a strong capital ratio of which enables us to declare an interim dividend of per share for the first half of the year the next two slides look at the growth were starting to see particularly in asia in wealth and personal banking weve already seen strong traction in our asia wealth business with global wealth balances up more than billion or in the last months this was driven chiefly by growth in assets under management rather than deposits weve expanded our asia wealth franchise recruiting around new frontline colleagues and growing affluent and high net worth customers in asia by while its early days were seeing promising productivity data from our pinnacle wealth planners in mainland china with exciting momentum within the business because of that were accelerating the rollout of pinnacle to five new cities in mainland china and planning to hire more wealth planners this year than we had originally planned in commercial banking pipeline growth is starting to translate into lending with billion of loan volume growth since the start of the year our approved lending limits in asia are up on last years second half and on prepandemic levels these include renewals refinancing and new facilities there are also signs of a recovery in asia trade with billion of trade finance lending growth in the first half in global banking and markets weve made good progress repositioning the franchise for growth the proportion of rwas allocated to asia in gbm is now percentage points higher than the same point last year with around a third of nonasia rwas supporting revenue booked in asia collaboration with other businesses is a big part of the gbm growth story with collaboration revenue up against last years first half this was supported by investment in new digital market platforms which are helping to support our asia wealth strategy slide goes deeper on the lending growth were starting to see weve seen strong mortgage growth globally with hong kong drawdowns up yearonyear and a record quarter for uk mortgages card balances are starting to recover in hong kong and the uk and elsewhere up around billion quarteronquarter in commercial banking were seeing improved lending limit growth translating into term lending with loans up versus the first quarter trade balances are up and we continue to capture market share in both hong kong and singapore were also continuing to grow our lending pipeline in hong kong and asia which bodes well for future quarters moving to slide both our us and european businesses saw a rebound in profits and both are now well advanced in their transformations the us made around billion of pretax profits up from around million in last years first half riskweighted assets in the us are now lower than at the same point last year and costs are down around million yearonyear weve announced the sale of our us mass market retail business which is an important milestone in the reshaping of our us portfolio and weve also now completed the migration of fixed income derivatives trading book from new york to london in europe we delivered billion of pretax profits after recording a loss in last years first half hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 compared with a year ago weve reduced rwas by and costs by which includes a million increase in variable pay weve also signed a memorandum of understanding to sell our french retail business both our us and european businesses are much better positioned to grow than at the start of the year slide looks at our second pillar digitize at scale our technology spending is now higher than the same period in and higher than last years first half this is making us a better and stronger bank both operationally and in terms of the customer experience and providing material operating leverage as we grow the business the proportion of payments that go straight through without manual intervention now stands at were reducing account opening times for example including first direct where it now takes minutes to open an account instead of days and weve introduced esignature for over processes in hong kong substantially reducing both processing time and the use of physical forms were launching and scaling new digital products our multicurrency global money account launched last year in the us and is now live in both singapore and the uae weve launched kinetic in the uk which already has more than users and a app store rating and were simplifying and automating trade finance by our digital trade transformation aims to reduce bespoke systems down to just clients and counterparties can already agree the wording of guarantees digitally which is then fulfilled seamlessly in our back office significantly reducing both time and effort in supply chain finance we can now digitally onboard suppliers in two days rather than eight helping clients to support their suppliers and increase the resilience of their supply chains these are big innovations with a real world impact for our customers slide looks at energize for growth our third pillar our move to hybrid working is now wellunderway with a reduction in our global office footprint since the start of three of our global business ceos are in the process of relocating to asia and we made a number of key leadership appointments in asia in the first half of the year were aiming to build a more diverse business weve signed up to the wefs partnership for racial justice in business and the un lgbti standards of conduct for business weve also increased the proportion of female leaders to more than but weve still much more to do and weve hired more than new graduates from different countries more than half of whom are female slide looks at our final pillar the transition to net zero i was delighted and grateful that of our shareholders backed our special resolution on climate change at our agm in may that was a strong endorsement of our climate strategy which has at its core a commitment to support our customers on their transition to low carbon were continuing to provide strong support to our customers on their transition journeys taking part in more sustainable financing in the first half of than in the whole of were working closely with our own suppliers to help them improve their climate reporting so that we can become net zero in our operations and supply chain by and were building partnerships to unlock new climate solutions and make them investable joining forces with wwf and the world resources institute to bring new projects and technologies into commercial scale overall its still relatively early in the life of our growth and transformation plans but im pleased with our progress so far hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 ewen will now take you through our results and update you on our targets ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning and afternoon all we had another solid quarter reported pretax profits of billion thats up almost fivefold on last years second quarter with an annualized return on tangible equity of for the first half adjusted revenues were down on last years second quarter due largely to the impact of the current rate environment together with the comparison against a very strong global market second quarter last year importantly we think were now close to the trough in yearonyear revenues with volume growth in our lending businesses and our wealth franchises driving a recovery in the coming quarters expected credit losses were million net release second quarter in a row of net releases this reflects a continued improvement in the economic outlook for our central scenarios less extreme downside scenarios given the progress in global vaccinations and exceptionally low stage charges in both the first and second quarters we still retain billion of the stage and ecl reserve buildup we made in operating expenses were up this was due to both higher performancerelated pay accrual and higher technology spend despite this we remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable operating cost for the year ex the bank levy subject of course to final decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year lending and deposit balances were up and respectively as lending growth spread for us beyond mortgages and retail banking and trade finance and commercial banking with increased confidence in higher loan growth in the second half of the year our core tier ratio was down nearly basis points at due primarily to our dividend accrual our tangible net asset value per share of was up on the first quarter and weve declared an interim dividend of per share for the first half of the year we remain on track to deliver all of our mediumterm targets including rebuilding to a return on tangible equity of at least turning to slide were continuing to shift the balance of the groups focus towards asia through capital reallocation and the buildup of capabilities and people however as other regions start to recover from covid19 lows were also seeing much improved earnings diversity with profitability in all regions during the half europe has gone from lossmaking in last years first half to generating of group profits in the first half of this year this included a strong contribution from our uk ringfenced bank which saw a revenue growth of in wealth and personal banking and in commercial banking there are also good signs of recovery elsewhere including the middle east the us and mexico were also now seeing more balanced profitability across our global businesses each business now generating roughly a third of group profits in the first half with a particularly strong recovery in commercial banking turning to slide and looking at the second quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses in wealth and personal banking revenues were down on a year ago wealth management revenues grew by million due mainly to an increase in the value of new business written in insurance and mutual fund sales growth in hong kong hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 personal banking revenues fell by million due to the impact of low interest rates on deposit margins commercial banking revenues were lower due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on global liquidity and cash management but with good growth in trade balances in the quarter and early signs of growth across other commercial lending in global banking and markets revenues were down this was largely due to slower customer activity and lower volatility in the fixed income markets as compared with a particularly strong global markets performance in the same period last year on slide net interest income was billion down against the second quarter of on a reported basis but stable compared with the first quarter of on rates the net interest margin was basis points down basis point on the first quarter primarily reflecting lower asset yields which more than offset lower funding costs on volumes we saw a continued good loan growth in mortgages in hong kong and the uk and strong commercial applications that have started to translate into drawdowns for the remainder of the year were seeing signs that net interest income has now stabilized and we expect loan growth to support net interest income in the second half on the next slide noninterest income was billion down against last years second quarter due to the exceptionally strong global markets performance in the second quarter last year however we saw good fee income progression in all our businesses against last years second quarter with strong performances in wealth global liquidity and cash management and capital markets and advisory we expect customer activity and fee income to continue to strengthen as economic activity recovers although the recovery path obviously remains uncertain as a result of covid19 variants on the next slide we reported a net release of million of expected credit losses in the quarter compared with a billion charge in the second quarter of the net release was across all global businesses this reflected an improved economic outlook together with stage charges that remained very low in the quarter recognizing that the risks that still exist from the pandemic were continuing to hold around billion of our covid19 uplift to stage and ecl reserves based on the current economic outlook we now expect the ecl charge for the full year to be materially lower than our mediumterm throughthecycle planning range of to basis points with the potential even for a net release for full year and further stage and releases in the first half of turning to slide second quarter adjusted operating costs were million higher than the same period last year this was driven by higher performancerelated pay accrual of million and a million increase in technology investment we made a further million of cost program savings compared with the prior year with an associated cost to achieve of million todate our cost programs have achieved savings of billion relative to our yearend target of billion to billion with cumulated cost to achieve spend of billion despite higher second quarter costs we continue to expect our adjusted operating costs excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy to be broadly in line with hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was down basis points in the quarter this reflected an increase in rwas from lending growth including a shortterm increase of around billion from ipo loans in hong kong together with a decrease in capital including a billion accrual for dividends as signaled at the time of our first quarter results we will include a deduction each quarter for dividend accruals for the half year that deduction was based on of our first half eps of which is the midpoint of our to target payout ratio to reiterate my comments from last quarter it shouldnt be read as a signal or a forecast of our dividend intentions the dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will true up at the full year based on the results and outlook at the time reflecting the current improved economic outlook and improved operating environment in many of our markets we now expect to move to our target payout range in weve retained the flexibility to adjust earnings per share for noncash significant items and in we also intend to exclude the losses on the sale of our french retail banking operations when thinking about the payout ratio for well attach a lower weight to unusually low ecl charges or credits as part of this years earnings per share together with a desire to see further progress from in dividends per share in and beyond excluding fx movements riskweighted assets rose by billion in the second quarter driven by growth in asia and the ipo loans i already mentioned we now expect lowsingledigit percentage growth in riskweighted assets for the full year on the next slide due to changes in the underlying calculation methodology weve updated our riskweighted asset savings targets on a likeforlike basis from billion to billion so far weve made around billion of transformation saves and remain fully on track to meet our target on slide its still early days in terms of our targets but weve made good progress so far were on track to meet our cost and riskweighted asset savings targets and we remain confident that were on track for a return on tangible equity at or above over the medium term the shift to higher return areas is underway and were starting to see results from the growth opportunities weve identified as mentioned we now intend to move to our target payout ratio in as a reminder our dividend policy aims to deliver sustainable cash dividends while retaining the flexibility to invest and growing the business in the future supplemented by additional shareholder distributions if appropriate so in summary this was another solid quarter for us a near fivefold increase in pretax profits on the same period last year with good earnings diversity across the group and evidence of strong execution in all areas of strategy while the results were materially flattered by a net release of ecls we can see early signs of a broadening recovery in lending with volume growth translating into revenue growth as our net interest margin stabilizes and growth in fee income across our businesses despite uncertainty on the pace of recovery from here we remain on track with all of our mediumterm targets and with that our ability to achieve cost of capital returns and to fund attractive growth hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 with that sharon if we could please open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions we will take our first question from martin leitgeb from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning and thank you for the presentation and for taking my questions if i can just start with comments you made on the risk of cost outlook in particular as we head into given the current economic outlook that thered be a scenario that risk costs could also undershoot the to basis points kind of for the cycle range as we head into just considering the management overlay still in place and related to that i was just wondering in terms of how we should think of scope for capital return i know there are comments in the presentation about the potential for a stepup in capital return i think the dividend guidance is clear how should we think about the scope for potential buyback is that becoming simply a possibility in particularly as we head into and is that a key instrument in terms of how we should think about getting the core tier ratio back to a level of to which is the target range thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to handle both of those ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks martin so on ecls in i do think that were going to continue to i talked about earlier of having billion of stage and stage reserves that we built up from last year is still in place thats around of the reserve buildup we put in place last year we do think that that will unwind or to the extent that that unwinds it will unwind over probably the following four quarters so there will be some benefit into the first half of i dont think that well begin to normalize on expected credit losses at this point until the second half of on capital distributions and ill give a slightly fuller answer given im sure that there will be several questions around this look relative to the comments i made at the start of the year around our capital position and capital distributions i think sitting today we are in a stronger position relative to what we thought weve seen a much improved credit outlook its our second quarter of reserve releases and an expectation that were going to continue to see additional releases over the coming four quarters weve also had much lower credit rating migration than what we thought leading to lower riskweighted asset growth relative to what we thought a few months ago so our core tier ratio today is stronger than where we thought wed be and the outlook is better we know that weve got some know and knowns in terms of capital headwinds software intangibles which is around basis points of benefit we expect to get removed from the beginning of if you look in combination i think theres roundabout basis points of aggregate hit from the sales of our french and us retail hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 banking franchises that will impact us into and and weve got various regulatorydriven uplifts of roundabout billion uplift in riskweighted assets over the next months but equally we know that weve just accrued under our accrual policy of dividend versus the that weve just declared and weve still got at least billion of rwa reductions in our rwa rundown program yeah we are committed to paying a sustainable and healthy dividend while continuing to progressively normalize our core tier capital position over the next months buybacks will be one way for us to think about normalizing and using our surplus capital and well continue to keep buybacks under review in the coming quarters and i would note that that tonality is different to what weve said in previous quarters as you recall at full year we said that we wouldnt contemplate buybacks this year were now saying that well keep it under review martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international very very clear thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of raul sinha from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi good morning everybody a couple of questions from my side as well perhaps one just to follow up ewen on your comments how will you define surplus capital for hsbc because im consciously talking about potential for growth opportunity after a very long period of time coming back onto the table and obviously you do have a very strong capital position with buybacks with writebacks to come but also potential to deploy that capital so its quite difficult from the outside to understand how much might be structurally excess surplus capital indiscernible thoughts on how we could go about doing that that would be helpful the second one is just to come back to the comment around nii stabilization and if i look at some of the moving parts within that the asia pac down basis points in the quarter again the uk business down basis points and quite a few of your uk peers are talking about nim pressure to come and theres billion or so of ipo funding in here in  as well so im just trying to understand what gives you the confidence that nii has finally stabilized is that more driven by the fact that youre seeing this card balance pick up or ewen do you think thats probably likely to be nim accretive sort of loan growth coming down the pipe or is there something in  trends that perhaps was creating the pressures thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes so on yes use of capital firstly obviously weve got organic growth i think were still sitting sticking to our target of mid singledigit loan growth over the next coming quarters into and ill come back to that in terms hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 of where were seeing that growth we also have been public about the fact that we are thinking about a number of small bolton acquisitions which are almost exclusively centered on the asian wealth space and i would use the word bolton quite carefully we are not looking at anything material but in aggregate we are looking at three or four opportunities in the wealth space across asia at the moment yeah i think our distribution policy as it relates to dividends is very clear the to payout range as i said for this year i think you should expect us to be at the lower end of that range because of the unusual benefit that we all have had from ecls this year and then on top of that buybacks on top of that so i think you can sort of do the math and know what were solving for the only thing that you wont have on that is the bolton acquisitions but if you think of three or four smaller bolton acquisitions of say billion each will help in relation to that math net interest income stabilization i think we are weve seen hibor now broadly stabilize if i look at second quarter of this year the average onemonth hibor rate was basis points i think in  so far its been around basis points so we are troughing now i think if you look at the underlying growth we had about billion of loan growth in the second quarter you can take about billion of that away for the hong kong ipo loans you can add back billion because we shifted the us portfolio that were selling into held for sale and there was probably up to billion of gbm runoff global banking and markets runoff in the loan portfolio particularly in the nonringfenced bank so we think we grew the underlying loan portfolio by about billion to billion which is about to growth in the quarter which is to growth for the full year which is very much in that run rate that i talked about yeah youre right that there may be some still some modest income pressure in the uk but i think you saw this quarter in the uk lending growth more than offset any decline in net interest margin and we continue to remain confident about our ability to grow faster than peers in the uk particularly in mortgages raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc got it thanks very much for that operator thank you your next question comes from the line of tom rayner from numis please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good morning good morning ewen good morning noel i was really going to push you a bit more on the dividend policy i think youve kind of explained it i think fairly well now but obviously if we see a big increase in i think the consensus payout i think this year is because it sounds like youre going to see earnings beat hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 because of the very low impairment number and therefore youre going to let the payout ratio go down towards the bottom and i guess as things normalize the payout goes back up again i mean this is just not really just saying youve got a progressive dividend policy im just wondering do you actually need this target payout range what sort of purposes that serve now or should we just be thinking youre looking to maintain a progressive dividend that you can increase each year and secondly i was going to also focus a little bit on the nii guidance and whether that the fact youre not specifically talking about nim indiscernible you are expecting now more nim pressure and it sounds like you are but again i wonder if you could talk to that relating to signs of maybe slower growth in asia maybe its going to take longer for interest rates to normalize than we thought only a month or two ago i wondered if you could just talk to that as well please thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah first around dividend policy i dont think weve said that we have a progressive dividend policy weve said that weve got a to payout i think obviously were conscious of the markets desire to have a progressive dividend policy but its not an official part of our policy so we would expect having said that that we would ideally like dividends to be higher than dividends so in the first half of this year again we accrued versus the we declared we had an eps of in the first six months and weve paid out so weve paid out just under of our earnings in the first half so mathematically we do expect a more substantial payout in the second half of this year and we would anticipate that dividends should be higher than dividends without committing to a progressive dividend policy on net interest income i dont think were going to see in aggregate much nim pressure from here equally im sort of ph loathed to call the bottom in nim and you know i hate forecasting it for you but i do think the combination that if any relative nim pressure from here coupled with stronger loan growth means that we are close to getting back into a cycle now of seeing net interest income grow and i think certainly by the time we get into well definitely see net interest income grow given nim will definitely have i think stabilized by then and on rates again relative to where we were six months ago where our planning position was that we are unlikely to see any policy rate rises probably until the very back end of or more certainly i think were much more enthusiastic now that we may begin to see policy rates rising led by the uk from sort of mid2022 onwards and certainly benefiting materially from higher policy rates noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and tom if i could just add a couple of comments on the nim generally were seeing the volume growth the new deal activity being transacted good nims good margins were not having to trade margin to get that volume growth there is one area where there is a lot of activity and thats uk mortgages but even there the margins were generating on uk mortgages are above the back book margins albeit slightly lower today than they would have hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 been three or six months ago but theyre still well above the back book margins so were not seeing a tradeoff on margin for new business relative to volume in any significant degree and then on dividend policy i just want to remind you we put the dividend payout ratio to because we wanted to get the balance right between distributing capital to generate a decent return for our investors but also retaining sufficient capital to fund future growth and future opportunities now to the extent that those future growth opportunities are not there either organically or inorganically then well consider buybacks or capital return but if we do see growth then we have the ability to fund that growth through retention of capital and our previous policy probably didnt get that balance right we were too much into distribution and not enough in to fund in future growth tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay thank you indiscernible very interesting thanks a lot operator thank you your next question comes from the line of omar keenan from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi omar omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning thank you very much for taking my questions so i just had a question on the asia wealth management strategy just bearing in mind that youre looking at a couple of bolton opportunities when you look at the hsbc wealth management offering in asia where do you think might be a particular geographic or product gaps that you might be looking to fill in and secondly just i had a question on the uk business and mortgage growth which strategically is looking to take market share i was wondering if theres been any thoughts around perhaps pursuing inorganic strategies there as well thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay thanks omar ill take certainly the first one on wealth boltons were clearly looking at pan asia we believe we have good organic growth opportunities with the platform we have in hong kong and therefore that would be the primary focus i think in hong kong would be primarily organic growth in hong kong were organically investing in china to grow our wealth business there and weve given you the plans for that recruiting an additional people over the mediumterm with already done in the first n up until the half first half this year if youre looking at therefore where the boltons are likely to be theyre likely to be rest of asia in terms of capabilities were looking at both product and distribution capabilities to accelerate our organic growth plans there were willing to invest organically in the rest of asia but if we can find some bolton acquisitions that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 can accelerate those organic investment plans that would be helpful we are looking at three to four as we speak and they are a combination of products and distribution capabilities being acquired in areas such as insurance high net worth wealth management and asset management so those would be the primary areas of focus on mortgage growth just ewen can fill you in a bit more on that but just for clarity our share of mortgages in the uk was below our natural footprint share of customers in the uk and what were doing is rebuilding to a more natural mortgage market share to match the market share of customers we have in the uk and the banking market so yes were taking market share from others but its to rebuild to where we believe we should be more naturally positioned ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and maybe just to add a few more comments to what noel said if you look at our current account market share by value and weve got a more affluent customer base yeah we have about a to share of current accounts our stock share is currently of mortgages we are and have been consistently growing our flow share in excess of stock share we grew flow share around in the quarter yeah about basis points higher than our stock share and why are we able to do that partly is because if you went back a few years we didnt have established broker distribution which as you know is around of the market in terms of distribution over the last few years weve fully built out broker distribution and were sitting on a lot of excess liquidity in the uk business which went up even further during covid we think the returns on new business highly attractive so i think you should expect us to continue to target higher growth in the mortgage market if we can continue to take share of the type of margins that we are currently seeing omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you very much ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and sorry on the you should read into that too that given that we have we think substantial organic growth opportunity we do not see the need to go out and invest inorganically in the uk mortgage market omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of aman rakkar from barclays please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi aman hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning noel ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning ewen yeah just one quick followup on mortgages if i may just around your rote i mean is there any chance that you could give us an indication of what kind of roe youre booking on mortgages as you currently observe it now and then just around gbm if i could ask around your expectations for the full year in that business and i know ficc was kind of down a decent chunk in  i mean how much of that do you think is down to normalizing markets versus restructuring and do you think we can continue to expect any kind of revenue attrition from restructuring this year in that business ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on mortgages were not going to go into the detail but were earning returns on capital materially above our cost of capital yeah partly because as you know uk mortgage risk weights are very low and weve got plenty of excess funding so that is very accretive business for us on global banking and markets i think weve said previously that we expect to be down on but above i think that continues to be our position as you know the whole street had a particularly weak quarter in fixed income partly because of the strength of fixed income a year ago and we do think that there are some lines in that fixed income business that are important to us like fx that will naturally recover as customer activity recovers both on the commercial side and the retail side out of covid equities for us actually had a really good quarter they outperformed peers but its a relatively small part of our overall global banking and markets franchise and capital markets and advisory remember we are weaker than some peers in the us and we have stayed out of spac financings which has been a big driver of some of the profitability of some of the peers but overall when weve done the comparison versus peers we didnt see anything in there that other than sort of in the pack for fixed income and outperforming in equities aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd and ewen can i just ask a quick followup on the mortgages i mean there is set to be quite a lot of regulatory rwa inflation coming down the pipe in the next to months i mean do you have any sense as to whether that might provide a floor to any of the pricing at a system level or do you think the system is already pricing basically adjusting for this rwa inflation ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean well we are certainly thinking about that rwa uplift i think in aggregate i think the floor at the portfolio level adds about billion of rwa uplift for us which is not material in the overall context of our uk hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 mortgage business but inevitably if rwa floors by or output floors by way down the track then pricing will adjust accordingly i think aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of andrew coombs citi please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi andy andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning one on costs and then one on wealth please just firstly on costs you flagged the stepup in variable pay this quarter but your full year cost guidance is unchanged so just trying to understand thats just the timing issue in the variable pay or whether the mix of the costs in your full year guidance is perhaps slightly different to what you first thought that would be the first question second question wealth if i look at life insurance manufacturing investment distribution the life insurance manufacturing number obviously has some benefits from market movement that makes up quite a big chunk of the revenue contribution in this quarter if we were to strip that out do you think thats a more normalized base level this quarter obviously youve still got the offshore sales to come back perhaps you could just comment both on whether investment distribution and life insurance manufacturing adjusted is a more normalized quarter and a fair base to indiscernible thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on costs for this year i think there is a mix change going on of a few hundred million not all of that increase in variable pay is a sort of timing issue some of it is an increase in the variable pay accrual relative to what we thought but yeah the mix shift i think andy is because we had anticipated in the second half that there were various line items that we would begin to see a return to normalization from covid that we think is going to be much slower than what we previously anticipated so generally yeah costs associated with running the bank like travel printing office premises and the like i think are going to run a few hundred million lower than what we previously anticipated for this year which offsets a slightly higher accrual into the variable pay for so thats why were sort of still confident in committing to the flat cost target on wealth i think yeah you have to bifurcate between the domestic hong kong business and what you see there is actually the hong kong business is doing okay and better than in previous quarters andy effectively the international business particularly the mainland china business which continues to be significantly impacted because of the closure of the border we dont expect that border to reopen until  at the earliest hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 so i wouldnt describe this quarter as a normalized quarter for insurance i would describe it as normalized probably for the hong kong business and continuing to be abnormally low for the china business andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd and just on the cost sorry a quick quick followup if youre saying the te has basically been delayed and thats the offset presumably you do expect the te to come back in so is the hope that that variable comp may also reverse slightly at that point ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc no i mean look i mean i think i would describe it as sort of margin for error in has tightened because of that pay pressure that were seeing relative to what we previously thought youre right that those covidrelated savings should get back to more normal levels or what we describe as more normal levels than onwards but remember also i think embedded in that is its new normal versus old normal for example weve reduced our travel budget if you looked in we were spending about million a year we have taken that down to a run rate of million a year for planning purposes going forward from onwards yeah weve talked about the big savings that we see in head office expenses getting out of of our own real estate ex branches over the next few years which will reduce that part of our cost structure by just over but youre right that those numbers were already embedded into our full year cost target so the other thing just again just for all of you our cost target was based on constant fx so what was billion today is about billion of costs for andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of guy stebbings from bnp paribas please go ahead your line is open guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi good morning noel and ewen thanks for taking questions just a couple of followups the first one was on margin mix has been diluted and then given the strength in secured i just wondered when you think about your loan growth and the to quarterly underlying growth and that had been consistent with your expectations going forward within that we should be assuming its still going to be tilted slightly more towards secured we can then obviously keep an eye on rates and other factors when it comes to adjustment on nim but just helpful to think about how much of that loan growth just to flow through into nii growth and then just going back to distributions and timing your now rwa growth in the second half it looks like your guidance of billion to billion sort of basis points capital growth given the cost should be much lower in the second half and ph this certainly suffice to the upside hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 so it feels like capital shouldnt move an awful lot in the second half even pro forma for the accrual if thats broadly correct and you sat there with to basis points of headwind to the target coming into the year can we take your comments around buybacks being a bit indiscernible in sort of next six months depending on boltons is that fair thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay if i could just quickly take the new business comment were not expecting a significant change in our mix between secured and unsecured i think we see the portfolio having a similar balance to history so were not re weighting that portfolio mix as you know we tend to be more of a secured book than an unsecured book we do have a credit card business we do have unsecured lending but in our wealth business we have a strong mortgage book and in our commercial banking and wholesale business it tends to be secured so we dont see a significant change do you want to take the second question ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so im not going to sort of comment on your maths in terms of where our core tier ratio may be at the end of the year but i think we would be slightly more cautious than you in saying that we expect it to be in line with where we currently are partly i think because we are anticipating decent rwa growth in the second half of the year but yeah overall in terms of yeah the main comment in relation to buybacks is i mean if you recall at the full year results back in february i said definitely no buybacks this year we softened that language slightly at  were softening it again now and we will definitely keep it under review and were not we are no longer calling out that theres an absolute ban on buybacks this year so well keep it under review guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay thank you operator thank you we will now take our last question and it comes from the line of manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp good morning everyone i wanted to just follow up on the comments on insurance please you were talking about the offshore sales coming back hopefully from  onwards i mean previously offshore insurance sales in hong kong made up about of total sales for that business do you think we can get back to that kind of level quite quickly once the border reopens and do you think there might even be a catchup of the lost business from the last couple of years coming through setting you up for a very strong if the border reopens and secondly and somewhat related i wondered if you could give us any indication of how you think ifrs will impact the business or if you cant indicate how it will impact the business can you tell us when you will give us some indication of how it impacts the business thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02aug2021 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think on the insurance i mean its very hard to predict life after covid relative to life before covid because there are so many things that are changing but we would expect to rebound but also youve got to be cognizant of the fact were investing in the greater bay area were investing in pinnacle were investing in our insurance capabilities and wealth management capabilities onshore so we believe well be wellpositioned whether it comes back into hong kong or it stays in hong kong sorry it stays in the greater bay area well have the ability to serve both markets ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and then the question on ifrs manus look were conscious of the fact that we owe the market an answer on this and some guidance around this i think certainly in the next couple of quarters no later than full year results well give a kitchen on what we think the impact of ifrs is but yeah broadly as you know reported earnings will be lower materially lower than current reported earnings for the insurance business manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay thats something to look forward to thank you very much noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc it would be sad if that is something to look forward to manus but indiscernible operator thank you i will now hand the call back to noel quinn for closing remarks noel quinn
