savings in the quarter and we retained a strong capital ratio of with further growth in both deposits and lending pointing out a few highlights on slide the combination of our digital campaigns and growing customer confidence saw strong credit card sales growth in hong kong we saw a good mortgage growth with drawdowns up in the uk and in hong kong our wealth strategy got off to a strong start with growth in overall wealth balances we attracted billion of net new money into private banking in the quarter and billion of net new money into asset management we saw a good loan volume growth in commercial banking and monthbymonth increases in lending approvals with nearly double the approvals in march of any one month in global banking and markets had a good quarter supported by strong current activity in capital markets we led more than billion of capital markets financing across global debt and equity markets and syndicated loans including around billion our social and covid19 response bonds which is around of the total market this was a global performance with good profitability in all regions and growth of billion in profits booked outside of asia compared with last years first quarter moving to slide i said in february that our growth and transformation plans were already in motion and you can see the evidence of that here under focusing on our strengths weve already grown wealth balances in asia by yearonyear weve grown our asia wealth ftes by more than including around new client facing wealth planners in mainland china and weve grown trade finance lending in asia by around billion mainly in china and hong kong under digitize at scale weve started to integrate our market leading payme app in hong kong into merchant checkouts and officially launched hsbc kinetic for smes in the uk with around customers already signed up under energize for growth were applying all that weve learned through lockdowns combined with our digital investment to improve the way we work we move into a hybrid model wherever possible giving our people the flexibility to work in a way that suits both them and their customers we will need less office space as a result and we have a plan to reduce our global office footprint by more than million square feet or around by the end of were also relocating three of our global business ceos to asia on a permanent basis taking them close to our customers and to the core of our business on the transition to net zero we published details of the climate resolution that well put to shareholders at our agm in may we are one of the founder members of the global net zero banking alliance that launched last week we maintained our leadership position in sustainable finance following a record quarter for global esg bond issuance and were piloting a new tool in the uk to help smes better understand their esg performance and to prepare to take action its early days but were carrying good momentum into the second quarter ewen will now take you through our results ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all we had a good quarter against the backdrop of ultralow rates reported posttax profits of billion thats up on last years first quarter and an annualized return on tangible equity of adjusted revenues were down on last years first quarter largely due to the impact of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 ultralow interest rates but there were notably good performances in some segments including asia wealth and wealth and personal banking asia trade finance and commercial banking and capital markets and advisory debt trading and equities and global banking and markets relative to the first quarter of adjusted revenues also benefited from the reversal of negative insurance market impacts and global banking and markets valuation adjustments expected credit losses had a million net release this reflects both an improved economic outlook for our central scenarios and in the uk and the us lower probabilities attached to downside scenarios operating expenses were up this was due to a shift in variable pay accruals to reflect quarterly profitability we remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable costs for the year ex the bank levy subject to final decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year lending and deposit balances were both up with confidence in higher loan growth in the remainder of the year our core tier ratio remained stable at and our tangible net asset value per share of was up on the fourth quarter with retained profits more than offsetting negative reserve movements turning to slide and looking at first quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses in wealth and personal banking revenues were down on a year ago wealth management revenues grew by just under billion due to the turnaround and insurance market impacts from a big loss last year and a good performance in equity and mutual fund sales in hong kong personal banking revenues fell by million due to the impact of low interest rates on deposit margins commercial banking revenues were lower due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on global liquidity and cash management but with a good bounce back in trade balances in the quarter and growing confidence in the lending pipeline for the coming quarters in global banking and markets revenues were up with strong performances in global debt markets and equities up and respectively and capital markets and advisory up more than just to remind you we have no significant exposure to spacs where some peer banks benefited from exceptionally high activity levels in the first quarter on slide net interest income was billion down against the first quarter of on a reported basis on rates the net interest margin was basis points down basis point on the fourth quarter primarily reflecting the fall in hibor during the first quarter on volumes we saw continued good volume growth in mortgages in both hong kong and the uk and strong commercial applications that we expect to translate into volumes in the coming quarters looking forward to the remainder of the year despite some continuing rolling impact of last years shift in interest rates we expect volume growth to support net interest income at levels broadly in line with the first quarter on the next slide net interest income was billion up against last years first quarter but noting last year was negatively impacted by volatile items due to covid19 overall net interest income stabilized in the quarter compared with falls over the previous three quarters wealth and personal banking and global banking and markets benefited from higher volumes better equity and mutual fund sales and stronger capital market activity fx revenues were down yearonyear but this was still a hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 good performance against an exceptional first quarter of commercial banking was down slightly reflecting lower trade and payment volumes due to the continuing impact of covid19 on activity levels looking forward we expect customer activity and fee income to continue to recover as economic activity recovers although this obviously remains subject to the impact of new covid19 variants and the continuing success weve seen todate in the roll out of a global vaccination program on the next slide we had a net release of million of expected credit losses in the quarter this compares with a billion charge in the first quarter of the net release was across all global businesses and reflected an improvement in the economic outlook notably in the uk including a reduction in downside probabilities last years first quarter included a large charge related to one single name corporate exposure in singapore but this years first quarter was still very benign for stage charges particularly on the wholesale side we retained ecl uncertainty overlays of billion broadly the same as the fourth quarter recognizing the risks that still exist from the pandemic but based on the current economic outlook we now expect the ecl charge for the full year to be below our medium term through the cycle planning range of to basis points turning to slide first quarter adjusted operating costs were million higher than the same period last year this was driven by higher performancerelated pay accrual of million primarily due to a shift in accruing a higher percentage of variable pay this quarter relative to the first quarter of we made a further million of cost program savings in the quarter with an associated cost to achieve of million todate our cost programs have achieved annualized saves of some billion against our target of billion to billion with cumulative costs to achieve spend of billion were not softening our vigorous approach on costs we continue to expect our costs to be broadly in line with excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy this is subject to final decisions on our variable pay pool later in the year which will be primarily driven by the pretax profitability of the group turning to capital on slide the impact of profit generation in the quarter was offset by fair value movements and other deductions including around basis points for foreseeable dividends as a result our core tier ratio was unchanged at in line with our shift to a payout ratio approach going forward the deduction for foreseeable dividends was based on one quarter of the dividend we expect to make the same capital deduction in the next two quarters based on the same trailing dividend assumption but to be clear were not signaling with this our dividend intentions excluding fx movements risk weighted assets fell by billion in the first quarter due to changes in to our portfolio mix and methodology and model updates to remind you we do expect some core tier headwinds going forward from regulatory changes these havent changed from the full year so in summary against the backdrop of ultralow interest rates this was a strong quarter for us our best in reported profit since the onset of covid19 and an annualized return on tangible equity of while the results were flattered by a net release of ecls we saw strong performances across various parts of the bank with continued strength in asia despite the impact of a very low hibor and a material recovery in profitability outside of asia hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 as we look out there remains heightened levels of uncertainty particularly driven by the continuing emergence of covid19 variants so expect us to retain a conservative position on capital funding and liquidity for the time being however based on the first quarter performance and the strengthened economic outlook noel and i are more optimistic about this year albeit cautiously than we were at our full year results in midfebruary with that sharon if we could please open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of ed firth kbw please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi ed edward firth q analyst kbw yeah good morning everybody i just had noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning edward firth q analyst kbw i guess one or two questions actually if thats okay i didnt expect to get on first little bit of a surprise you caught me out the first question was on capital i was sort of surprised that the capital ratio wasnt stronger given the earnings beat and risk weighted assets falling and i just wondered if you could give us some more color around that i think it was a minus minus basis points hitting the chart exactly whats driving that and how we might expect that to progress going forward i guess that was the first question and then the second question was restructuring charges seem to be running some way lower than you were perhaps informally guiding to anyway at the full year should we expect those to pick up during the rest of the year and can you give us sort of any color on how that might end up ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on the restructuring charges were not changing our full year guidance we gave at full year results youre right  was unusually low so yes you should expect those to pick up as the year progresses on capital yeah a few things there were deductions for fair value reserve movements on cash flow and negative fx movements there was a higher deduction for bocom as its profits increased and again note that we talk about a basis point deduction for the foreseeable dividend which is new for us that will represents a change in policy because weve shifted to a payout ratio policy hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 edward firth q analyst kbw okay so i mean based on what we can see the bulk of those sound to me like they are peculiar to this quarter thats not theres not a sort of underlying ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes edward firth q analyst kbw headwind peculiar to this quarter okay thanks so much operator thank you your next question comes from line of fahed kunwar from redburn please go ahead your line is open fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd hi good morning noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd good morning just a couple of questions the first one is on margins and you gave a color on this during the call but just to dial in on your major regions just to understand how much of that is kind of lower rates feeding through previously lower rates and slightly lower hibor and is there anything on competitive pressure thats drifting those margins down or is it all about the background yield curve and rates the second question is just on the writeback actually so it does look like a lot of the writebacks are from the uk particularly uk commercial a is that right were they mainly uk commercial and b what did you see that was driving that was it an outlook on the vaccine rollout or was it specific data points that you were seeing on the uk corporates or uk personal if that was the case thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on nim it was i think almost exclusively driven by the shift in yield curves so i mean what were actually seeing yeah we broadly repriced all of our liabilities now and on the asset side actually were seeing some opportunity for margin expansion so for example in the uk we increased margins to try and slow down some of the inflows that we were seeing and we have for several quarters seen some opportunity to reprice in asia on the commercial side so we do think that we are now close to troughing on nim i mean obviously hibor slipped a little bit further in  but as you know that translates very rapidly into the books given the shortdated nature of assets and liabilities in hong kong hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 and for net interest income yeah loan growth in  was sort of mid2 and were signaling that we expect mid singledigit growth over the full year so that does imply much higher growth rates and lending volumes in the remaining three quarters which weve got confidence in given the pipelines that we can see which should help support net interest income over the remainder of the year even if there is still some residual nim pressure coming from the rolloff of books as a result of last years interest rate shift on writebacks youre right there was a larger writeback in commercial particularly in the uk commercial i think in part that reflected the very large reserve buildup that we had last year look overall there were sort of various things going on which made this an unusual quarter for us firstly we had very low stage losses around about million or so in the quarter which was unusually low we think and secondly on stage and stage two things really an improvement in economic forecast for central scenarios and most places that we do business coupled with as you know we went into the full year with very large probabilities particularly in the uk against downside scenarios which we have reduced on the back of a very successful vaccination program here and we would expect were also seeing that in the us and we would expect to see that in other markets as the vaccine programs ramp up elsewhere fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd its great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of omar keenan from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open omar keenan q analyst credit suisse good morning can you hear me okay noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah omar keenan q analyst credit suisse great and my question is thank you for the questions my question is with the wealth and personal banking rationalization in france and the us i was just wondering what the appetite might be to use released risk weighted assets and potentially excess capital to add portfolios in your other markets where it might make sense noting here that a large global bank has put up consumer balances in about markets so im just wondering where your view is with where markets might open up in those geographies where hsbc might think it makes sense to be bigger rather than smaller thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you as you know our primary focus in the wpb business is to grow our wealth part of that business and therefore we are looking at opportunities for both organic and bolton inorganic opportunities but its primarily hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 focused on wealth businesses either acquiring products or distribution capability in wealth management insurance in private banking thats the primary focus rather than just the geographic expansion of retail banking capability so were more focused on that for opportunity and it will be asiabased largely omar keenan q analyst credit suisse great thanks so essentially the way that we should read that theres going to be no balance sheet bolton ma that would consume any excess capital its really just youre focused on organic strategy noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc well we would use capital to do an ma deal but it would be itd be what were buying is less retail banking assets more wealth management capabilities so we will use up free we will use freed up capital if we see bolt on acquisition opportunities but as i say its more around wealth management capabilities than it is retail banking capabilities we will look at opportunities as they emerge ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and i would use make sure you listen to the word bolton were not sort of planning anything substantive so yeah will it eat into some of the excess capital yes but it will be relatively modest if we choose to do anything omar keenan q analyst credit suisse thats understood can i maybe just ask a quick followup on that so having said that and just bearing in mind your comments from last quarter ph surrounding not to expect buybacks this year could you perhaps paint the path for us towards returning excess capital which hsbc is clearly building noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so i mean i think weve been clear on our distribution policy certainly our dividend policy we said were going to shift to a to payout ratios from next year thats going to be all cash this year were going to transition towards that we will close to an payout ratio last year we do expect subject to seeing how the second quarter goes to be in a position to pay an interim dividend in the middle of the year and then reevaluate whether or not well shift to quarterly dividends from at the end of this year on buybacks look we continue to have no current intention to do buybacks this year you know that weve used buybacks in the past so theyre certainly something that we do and do actively consider as a tool of capital management and we are committed to active capital management hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 we do think at the moment that yeah when we look at consensus versus where we are we do see rwa growth probably being a tad higher than is in most peoples models we see loan growth being fuller than i think all of you currently are currently modeling thats on the back i think of yeah very strong growth that we continue to see in mortgages across the uk and hong kong a commercial pipeline that is building nicely and just in context in one of the slides youll see that our commercial pipeline is running close to higher than it was in  in  and we do think other segments like consumer credit will bounce back as we recover out of covid there are about billion of regulatory headwinds that we see this year offsetting that theres the sort of billion or so of rwa rundown that we expect were making good progress on that we did about billion in the first quarter and the last thing is were still cautious on credit rating migration particularly as some of the government support packages roll off for here in the uk for example as furlough rolls off and what impact that has on credit later in the year so yeah we are probably slightly more cautious on capital and excess capital than would be in your numbers at the moment omar keenan q analyst credit suisse thats wonderful thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of tom rayner numis please go ahead your line is open tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes hi good morning both noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc morning tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd just two questions please first on credit quality you obviously released billion from stage reserves in  i think you flagged billion still left on balance sheet and your guidance if i take the bottom of your range i know youre saying you could be below which suggests a sort of fullyear charge of somewhere around billion or lower i just wonder that guidance in itself what does that imply in terms of further stage releases for the rest of and then i know youve already touched on this i was going to ask you to then just expand on your thoughts about when the government programs actually do end whats your thoughts on sort of releases over two to threeyear period that was the first question and i have a second one on costs please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay well look on ecls i mean i said in my opening remarks that weve retained uncertainty overlays of about billion so we think were retaining currently about of the reserve build up in stage and stage if we were to stick to the central economic scenario i would think you would see some of that get released this year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 maybe some of it get released in the first half of next year i think were going to continue to be pretty cautious about how we do release were not expecting a repeat of  in terms of further ecl performance during the remainder of the year and there still is a pretty broad array of outcomes i think depending on how we progress out of covid and obviously there are a few risks on the horizon particularly around new variants and whether any of those become vaccine resistant so yeah where we land below basis points well see but you should assume that within that that we are confident that we will end up below basis points noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean you know as well its important that we adopt a cautiously optimistic approach to reserves and the way the economy will develop were optimistic were seeing good signs but its still relatively early days for the vaccination program thats why we wanted to retain around of the provisions that we created last year weve had a very good stage quarter in  with only million of stage charges thats below the normal trend line that one would expect so i think it is right to be cautiously optimistic and continue to position the balance sheet cautiously tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah i mean i think i was possibly leaning to are you being too cautious now but i completely get the point about the uncertainty over government programs noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and i think we can tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd and vaccines noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc adjust as the year develops well adjust on a quarterly basis our view of what the future holds tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay lovely thanks and just on costs your comments on broadly stable for the full year barring further performancerelated issues i mean if i looked at last year and i just took  it was very neat of the full year total ex the levy if i annualize  this year im looking at sort of growth im just trying to get a feel for where your confidence is coming from is this just incremental cost savings or are you really building in an expectation that this performance related pay is going to push us away from that broadly stable i mean if it is performance related thats not a bad thing either necessarily but im just trying to get a feel for how confident you are really on that broadly stable target thanks hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look in the first quarter there was about a million to million adjustment due to us taking a higher accrual for variable pay compared to  last year so i think if you back that number out what youll see is that we were broadly flat costs in the quarter and you would expect the variable pay accrual ph other than being equal to be a few hundred million dollars lower for the remaining quarters of the year which i think gives you confidence in that statement were always signaling on the variable pay accrual i think what we saw in as part of the full year results as you would all know there was a very different approach across the sector in terms of performance pay we took our pool down by close to for the full year but we saw some peers particularly us peers and particularly some european peers who were concentrated on the wealth and investment banking space pay in very different places so were just cognizance of the fact that for competitive reasons we may need to top up our current pool assumptions as the year progresses but that would only be down on the context of improved profitability but absent that change and again in context we paid about billion in variable pay last year so you can do your own math and size what that risk is but absent that were very confident that were on track to deliver broadly flat cost this year and i would stress theres no change at all in the internal management focus on the cost program tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay lovely thanks a lot operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of guy stebbings exane please go ahead your line is open guy stebbings q analyst exane sa united kingdom good morning or afternoon everyone thanks for taking the questions i had two firstly on rwas and then just briefly to come back on costs i just wanted to check on the rwas your commentary that you see rwas being higher than consensus is that a reference beyond just as we look at  quite encouraging quarter you can take the fx and grow sales so given where we start  further growth stage to come it didnt strike me that consensus looks particularly high on but perhaps youre more cautious in terms of credit migration and the volume growth i just want to check if its a or beyond sort of story there and then second question just on costs sort of come back to your commentary on performance score i think originally you used to said it would be driven by pbt so i am just interested was that more weighted to pre provision profit or to impairments for ph materially low below mediumterm cost of risk that could be a factor or is it more sort of competitive pressures that you just talked to that would drive that thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean variable pay is set on yeah largely on bottom line profitability but we do take some yeah for example last year i think profits fell by around a third and we took the variable pay pool down by if we saw hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 the reverse go this year and it was largely driven by ecl outperformance i dont think we would take all of that outperformance into a change in variable pay noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc correct and if you remember we what were managing to is leaving vp to one side were on track and confidence of our ability to deliver the transformation cost savings that we talked about in february and the february before that so the underlying cost position of the bank is wellpositioned and on track to meet those expectations weve had a strong profit performance in  and therefore weve topped up the vp for the  performance well have to see what happens in   and  but the most important message for you is were on track for our underlying transformation cost savings ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the question on rwas yeah just in terms of again i think we would be confident of achieving yeah midsingledigit loan growth weve probably got another 20orsobillion to go in our rwa reduction program next year but then you will have yeah basel iii reform coming through which will probably lead to a to uplift in rwas next year so if you i dont know how that compares with consensus but broadly thats whats in our head at the moment guy stebbings q analyst exane sa united kingdom okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp goo morning and i just wanted to come back on the point on costs please i just wanted to understand more how it will evolve going forward because from what youre saying it sounds as if to the extent that revenues are being led by areas like wealth and markets that will drive potentially higher variable compensation and therefore higher expenses than youve been guiding for but am i right to say if revenue growth hands off to more balance sheetled type nii and commercial banking we wouldnt see that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look manus its always going to be a mix of our internal metrics of what we think we cant afford based on the profitability of the group but we can never be uncognizant of whats going on in the market so if we are seeing competitive pressure in areas like asia wealth and investment banking more broadly yeah we have to be in a position to respond to those competitive pressures but i think your statement is right to the extent that well what you see is a rebalancing of profitability being driven out of the commercial bank and the retail bank that wont necessarily drive the same competitive pressure on performance pay noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc manus the only other thing id say is when we talked about our future growth fronts in february we assumed a growth in revenue coming in tracking back to roteplus we had a rebound in ecls we had further performance on cost takeout and we had a reboot of revenue from a reboot of the economy and incremental activity that were investing in so we had assumed revenue growth going forward in and and beyond and therefore we had assumed a growth in profit and therefore we had assumed the growth in variable pay to match that path and that was all inherent in the cost statements we made back in february so we have put into our future forecasts a growth in vp to match the growth in the pl that we expect to see what i think you saw in  is a particularly strong performance in  that was over and above that underlying curve that gets us to that rote now if that over performance continues in future quarters then maybe that assumes growth in vp will be higher in the future than was in that original assumption but so too would be the pbt and so too would be the revenue so i dont assume there isnt a growth in vp inherent in the plans that underpinned the journey to a rote does that make sense manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp it does yes thank you thats clear thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of yafei tian from citigroup please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning yafei tian q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you for taking my questions i have a question related to the top line really trying to understand the beat of noninterest income as you get wealth is particularly strong and on the slide you mentioned that the net new money for private banking you see a very strong growth in this quarter as well just trying to separate some of the internal changes as well as growth that you have done from a sustainable basis from this more volatile market trends would you be able to give us some more detailed guidance in terms of how much wealth related revenue growth you are expecting for this year and probably for the coming years based on your internal planning thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah it was hard to hear you but i think what you were looking for was more of an indication of where the growth in wealth is coming from and let me also be clear we started that journey of investing in our wealth businesses last year and that was investing in a build out of our product capability to make sure we had good product capability on the shelf in asia and an investment in distribution so we launched the pinnacle initiative in china as an example but we were also investing in private banking in our insurance business we were investing in both physical manpower to drive that growth in the wealth managers but we were also investing in digital infrastructure so our insurance business in hong kong particularly launched a lot of new initiatives last year new products digital based supported by extra salespeople and thats whats been driving the growth of our wealth revenues in asia i would its not just market sentiment or market valuations that are driving that growth its actual underlying growth thats coming through now we still have more to do we recruited an extra wealth managers in asia in the first quarter alone of those in china as part of an expansion of our pinnacle opportunities the converge where are we getting the business where how are we sourcing the wealth opportunity well im pleased to say were sourcing a lot of it from our existing client base around about of the net new money that goes into our private bank it comes from commercial banking clients and global banking clients the owners of those businesses are putting their personal wealth with us the same is true of asset management around of the net new money for asset management is coming from internal hsbc clients so its true organic growth at an underlying level not just growth in assets as a consequence of market revaluation of those assets there is an element of that in  as markets revalued but its theres a lot of it coming from underlying growth yafei tian q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you would it be possible to give us some guidance in terms of the wealth revenue growth outlook into percentage ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc we talked about our revenue growth outlook in february were assuming for asian wealth were assuming close to doubledigit growth in assets as we said in february and midsingledigit growth in other regions outside of asia and that would result in probably asia wealth revenues to grow at around about cagr over the next few years yafei tian q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 and if i remember correctly i think if you look at market sentiment and market stats youre probably looking at the underlying market in asia probably growing so were trying to outperform the market by the organic investment program that were putting in place yafei tian q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of raul sinha jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning noel good morning ewen noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks so much for taking my questions the first one is just on loan growth loan demand i was trying to understand a couple of points firstly how sustainable do you think this current activity spike in the uk mortgage market is obviously you along with all of the uk banks have benefited from very strong mortgage pipelines and pricing so just wondering tying that into your overall comments on loan demand what youre assuming happens to that for the rest of the year and then just related to that i suspect theres an element of pentup demand in other areas of loans in the uk as well as probably across your footprint as well so to balance that out if you could talk a little bit about where you see pentup demand in loan growth thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yes let me deal with the consumer book first the retail banking business first i think in the uk its true that there is strong activity at the moment there will undoubtedly be an element of that which is driven by the stamp duty holidays that were put in place that are likely to come to an end shortly but i also believe there is some structural changes taking place in the uk in that the housing market in the uk i think will remain active for quite a period of time as the housing stock is continued to be built out so i think theres an underlying growth curve there and theres a potential temporary growth curve as a consequence of the stamp duty holiday i think well see a pickup in activity on consumer lending unsecured lending and credit card activity in the second half of the year not just in the uk but across the world if you just take our own balance sheet we grew last year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 our deposit balances by around about billion last year now an element of that billion will turn into cash spend by consumers and businesses in the second half of this year or will start already started but will continue to pick up so i think youre going to see traditional unsecured lending and credit card activity see an increase in the second half of this year hong kong remains strong demand on mortgage growth and were pleased on that more broadly into the wholesale business what i saw at the end of last year particularly in  was a lot of activity from corporate borrowers seeking facility renewals or facility extensions to get ready to get their balance sheet ready for the upturn in the economy as they started to see vaccines come on stream but i didnt see that translate into loan drawdowns in  of last year i have started to see that take place in  of this year so for example the trade balance sheet in asia grew by billion in the first quarter of this year thats an indication of underlying economic growth if the vaccine programs continue as they currently are you could assume that that trend will continue and could well pick up and then more generally there was a starting to see a drawdown in those facilities that were negotiated at the end of last year taking place in  so overall our commercial banking balance sheet grew by billion in  of this year and our personal banking loan book grew as well so i think its early stage of growth and i could expect the trend to pick up as over the next three quarters raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks very much thats really helpful i was wondering if i could have one more on capital just a very quick clarification i was wondering if you have any further thoughts on the stress testing timeline this year and if theres any scope for regulatory restrictions in the uk to come off earlier for yourselves ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well i mean i think you know that theres a sort of current mini stress test being done by the bank of england and the pra and that was in the absence of them having done an annual cyclical scenario at the back end of last year as we sit here today i guess were not expecting any surprises out of that given weve been extensively stress testing our books through the pandemic and in recent months obviously outlook has improved so were not expecting the bank of england at this point to be were expecting us to be the driver of our distribution policy i guess is the better way of describing it raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc got it thank you operator thank you we will now take our last question and the question comes from the line of martin leitgeb from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi martin hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yeah hi ewen hi noel thank you for taking my question i just had a follow up on earlier comment on margin outlook from here and i was just wondering if you could maybe shed a little bit of light on how we should think of a nim progression here for the main business lines so indiscernible hong kong shanghai banking corporation and in particular the uk ringfenced bank i was just wondering if its fair to assume that the bulk of rate cut impact has by now ph flagged through in hong kong and from here we should see stability and if anything at some point indiscernible and that if anything some of the remaining margin pressure is coming through from structural hedge rollover in particular in the uk and i was just wondering should we assume margins to remain broadly flat in terms of level what we have seen or is there is your guidance of i think you said earlier that nii is broadly representative of the full year if i missed that right does that imply that combined with loan growth you would expect some further margin compression heading into and then just a follow up on capital i was just wondering if you could update us on how much progress you have made in addressing capital inefficiencies within the group whether if you could let us know how big the principal investment book is at this stage and what portion of transfers into asia has occurred so far thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the nim question i mean you know martin that not all of our interest rate sensitivity is in the first year i mean there is a degree we talked about previously about a billion of interest rate pressure coming lower rates into and then obviously hibor did drop meaningfully in the first quarter has remained broadly stable in the second quarter at the levels of the first quarter so far that we do think we are getting towards the trough of nim pressure but it would be a big call to say that  was the trough i still think there will be an element of pressure into the second quarter and then obviously volume growth then provides us confidence that the impact on net interest income is negligible the other thing i would say about the growth that well be back end loaded as we go progressively through the year and as confidence builds during the year and therefore you wont get much as much of that benefit into but you will get all of that benefit into so i talked about earlier assuming that the  net interest income was a good guide to the annualized net interest income for the full year but you should take away from that therefore that were also confident about decent net interest income growth into on hong kong most of the impact of lower hibor gets translated into our books within three months so equally the reverse is true if we were to get back to a better shortterm hibor curves we would see that very rapidly translate into improved net interest income in hong kong im sorry i didnt quite catch the second question martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 yeah i was just wondering on capital inefficiencies so previously you spoke about that some capital inefficiencies indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc multiyear program of work yeah weve got for example probably billion plus of excess capital in the us that will come out we expect over several ccar cycles theres various capital optimization opportunities that were working on in asia which will take a few years to effect so i would say its a sort of multiyear program of work we know what that program of work is and were just progressively working on them and some of it is driven by sort of ongoing discussions with regulators and i think the confidence in regulators to see capital release coming out of places will obviously improve as we see a stronger path out of covid martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international very clear thank you very much operator thank you i will now hand the call back over to noel for any closing remarks noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks sharon so to summarize weve had a good start to the year with good business growth and an improved lending pipeline moving into the rest of were making good progress on our growth and transformation plans and remain on track to deliver what we promised in february we remain absolutely committed to our cost transformation plans were feeling more optimistic about the rest of the year than we did in february but we remain cautious around the uncertainties that remain if you have any further questions please do pick them up with richard and the team thank you once again for joining us today operator thank you
