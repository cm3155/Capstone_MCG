management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analysts conference call for hsbc holdings plcs annual results for for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning to everyone in the room in london today and great to see you all again and good afternoon to those watching from hong kong and around the world before georges takes you through the  numbers ill start with a summary of our strategic progress when we started our transformation three years ago we also revisited our core purpose and values opening up a world of opportunity is the reason hsbc exists we are making it a reality for our customers our results today are evidence of that and im pleased that our performance also demonstrates that our people are living and breathing our values particularly the fourth value which is get it done i will demonstrate during the discussion today that we have achieved a lot over the last three years and that we are committed to doing even more i want to start by telling you the three elements im going to cover in the presentation today transformation was the first phase of our strategy execution three years ago the fair criticism of hsbc was that unprofitable or subscale businesses and clients were dragging down good profitability from our international proposition and from the profits generated in hong kong and the uk im pleased to say weve addressed this our international connectivity is now underpinned by good broadbased profit generation around the world hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 delivery in is all about the good set of results weve just announced i will come to the detail later but im pleased adjusted profits before tax were up were firmly on track to achieve our returns target for onwards and we expect to have substantial distribution capacity for higher dividends more buybacks and potentially a special dividend in early but theres also so much more we can achieve so the final element of the presentation is growth and returns its all about how we will further improve performance going forward as weve transformed weve built a strong platform for the future that will enable us to meet our customers needs and i expect wealth payments and fx fee income technology investment and climate finance to provide new value creation opportunities in the years to come so taking these three messages in turn starting with transformation three years ago we set out to tackle a series of fundamental problems lossmaking businesses unprofitable products and clients inefficient capital and costs our transformation journey has six components which i will run through in more detail on the following slides our international connectivity remains our biggest differentiator and weve grown and protected many of our marketleading international businesses during the three years but weve done that while repositioning unprofitable and nonstrategic businesses particularly in the us and europe thats resulted in a client proposition that is now built on international connectivity underpinned by a broad base of geographic profit penetration sic generation all of this has been supported by strong cost discipline which has enabled us to drive a step change in our technology investment weve also removed the dilutive scrip dividend and introduced the new sustainable dividend policy which is delivering attractive ongoing returns for shareholders and enabling us to invest in the business so crucially weve created a strong platform for improved growth and returns with new opportunities for value creation our focus now is to capitalize on these opportunities taking each of these in turn in terms of international connectivity our greatest strength remains our ability to connect the worlds major trading and investment blocks we are the worlds number one trade bank top for fx and a leading payments company last year we processed more than trillion of payments globally international is also core to our value proposition around of our wholesale client business is done cross border and in wealth and personal banking we now have million international customers which is up on last year this is significant because our international customers generate around twice the average revenue as our domestic customers our international connectivity is also translating into higher revenue and market share since weve grown global payments solutions revenue by cagr trade revenue by cagr and revenue from global foreign exchange has increased by cagr overall transaction banking revenue was up by cagr over the last three years we also see an opportunity to create even more value by continuing to grow these product lines over the coming years the next slide drills down into how we reshaped our portfolio across the group we reduced riskweighted assets by a cumulative billion well in excess of our target of billion weve made key strategic decisions to sell our us mass market retail bank our retail banking operations in france and our banking business in canada hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 weve also announced exits from russia and greece with other potential smaller exits being considered weve reallocated more of our capital to asia and by asia i mean the whole of asia we want to build strong wealth businesses in mainland china india and singapore alongside strong business we already have in hong kong we accelerated this process through bolton acquisitions and investments in the last months weve completed the integration of axa singapore and lt investment management in india and in mainland china as well as continuing the organic buildout of pinnacle we had seven main license approvals since these enabled us to take full ownership of hsbc life china and increase our majority stake in hsbc qianhai to as i said earlier we now have an international connectivity underpinned by good broadbased profit generation as this slide demonstrates this is the single biggest change compared to three years ago i wont go through all the numbers on this slide but i will mention a few the total amount of adjusted profit contributed by asia excluding hong kong and mainland china was more than billion in an increase of compared to mainland china excluding associate income from bocom contributed around billion of profit last year in a challenging year and india contributed a further million of adjusted profit outside asia the middle east generated billion of adjusted profits last year hsbc uk delivered billion of adjusted profits and weve got leaner more profitable businesses in continental europe and the us continental europe generated adjusted profits of over billion and the us adjusted profits of over billion both of those businesses were close to loss making or loss making three years ago mexico is another high returning business it delivered return on tangible equity of and worthy of note that of new to bank retail customers last year were acquired through corporate client relationships by the provision of employee banking services and payroll services demonstrating the value of our connected model in the country the next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline weve demonstrated and we will maintain the reduction of the corporate real estate our branch network and operations head count have all delivered material savings and we expect to achieve further efficiencies in the years to come but the most important point on this slide is that weve used these cost savings to increase investment in technology sic out in operations costs sic in in technology investment this is spending in the right place to build the business of the future and it has enabled us to fundamentally change the way we operate our formal cost reduction program threeyear cost reduction program has now ended but we still expect more than billion of cost saves to flow through into from that program there will be no easing up at all in our cost discipline but i think its right that we will also continue to identify opportunities to create efficiencies going forward that will deliver sustainable cost savings in future years with any associated costs from those programs reported through the cost line not treated below the line as sig items whilst we have transformed we have also invested in areas that we expect to deliver strong growth and returns in the future our strong balance sheet has always been a defining characteristic of hsbc and weve continued to grow the deposit book and assets over the past three years this is benefiting our performance now that rates have increased hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 developing our wealth business has also been a strategic priority our investments over the past three years are gaining traction reflected in revenues of over billion in excluding market impacts which is a cagr compared to its also reflected by increased insurance market share in hong kong the next slide sets out the impact of the step change we made in technology investment the faster services reduced friction and more competitive products that this investment has enabled have been critical to improving the customer experience with our digital propositions our aim is to build once deploy globally our upgraded mobile banking app is available in markets and has around million active customers hsbc kinetic our awardwinning business banking app in the uk now has around new to bank customers and as well as global wallet and global money weve rolled out our new digital trade finance platform in hong kong and the uk so that our marketleading businesses are well positioned for the next years in addition we are launching new products like hsbc orion which is our proprietary tokenization bond issuance platform using blockchain the first public bond was priced on it last month turning now to delivery in im pleased with our performance as you know from  the reported numbers include a billion impairment for the planned disposal of our french retail business adjusted revenue was up on the back of a strong net interest income performance and adjusted profits were up we delivered a good cost outcome in a high inflation environment by containing adjusted cost growth to around expected credit losses were a billion charge the dividend was per share the cet1 ratio was and we achieved a reported rote of or once you strip out significant items so were firmly on track to deliver returns of plus from onwards im now going to quickly run through our four strategic pillars starting with focus on our strengths our market leading commercial banking franchise had a very good year adjusted revenue was up almost on last year there was further good growth in trade and global payments solutions benefited from higher interest rates it was encouraging to see fee income grow by and there was strong adjusted revenue growth across all regions in wealth and personal banking revenue was up overall personal banking had a particularly strong year and lending balances were up despite subdued economic conditions in hong kong wealth was also up excluding market impacts and one of the best signs that our wealth strategy has gained traction is net new invested assets of billion in an increase of compared to this is highly promising for future revenue generation there was also continued growth in the value of new business in our asia insurance franchise despite adverse market conditions and again there was strong revenue growth in all geographies global banking and markets also performed very well in markets and securities services was up due mainly to rate rises and a standout foreign exchange performance banking was up also mainly due to higher rates in a challenging year for investment banking globally this good performance underlines the resilience of our model collaboration revenues from crossselling global banking and markets products to customers in commercial banking and wealth and personal banking were up there was strong growth in client business booked in the east but originated in europe and the americas up around on the previous year this again underlines geographic diversification of our revenues and that our greatest strength is connecting the worlds major economic blocs hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 the next slide is on digitize our scale our second pillar it illustrates the outcomes of our increasing investment in technology within retail and wholesale penetration levels increased materially more than of commercial banking customers are now digitally active and almost half of retail customers are now mobile active we also believe we can grow these numbers further the next slide covers energize for growth and how were changing the culture of hsbc taking out unnecessary layers of management has helped increase our speed and agility in our last staff survey the number of colleagues who say that work processes allow them to work efficiently was percentage points sic above the sector benchmark confidence within the organization has also increased of our colleagues told us that they are confident about our future which is percentage points above the sector benchmark and an increase of percentage points since we made further progress against our diversity commitments with increases in representation of female leaders and black heritage leaders of our key leadership roles are now located in asia and if i reflect on the leadership of our asian business five years ago versus today i see much more asian heritage talent and a strong pipeline of talent coming through that we continue to develop at the same time we know we have more to do in all these areas the next slide looks at our final pillar and the leading role that were playing in the transition to net zero the amount of sustainable financing and investment provided and facilitated in was up slightly despite the market for green social sustainable and sustainabilitylinked bonds being substantially down the cumulative total amount since the start of is now billion weve set new targets for onbalance sheet financed emissions for six high emitting sectors we recognize that methodologies and data for measuring emissions will continue to evolve and our own disclosures will therefore continue to evolve as well we continue to reduce emissions across our own operations and supply chain which were down more than since finally my third message is about growth and returns we are firmly on track to deliver returns of at least in but theres also so much more we can achieve and we can deliver higher growth and returns as we move out of transformation and into value creation we plan to grow our core businesses which are built on our international connectivity and the strong broadbased growth we have now spanning every region the investment weve made in new sources of value creation wealth payments and fx fee income technology and sustainability will all increase and diversify our revenue and we wont be relinquishing our grip on costs because it enables us to spend in areas that create value our improved profitability and sustainable dividend policy will give us a substantial distribution capacity with a dividend payout ratio established for and a return to quarterly dividends from  the consideration of buybacks brought forward to the  results and on top of this the consideration of a special dividend of to be paid in early subject to the completion of the canada transaction and necessary approvals so our current strategy remains the best way to improve returns for our shareholders and now ill hand over to georges thanks georges hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 georges elhedery chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel hello everyone thank you for joining in person and via webcast today i am glad to see many familiar faces and im looking forward to meeting those of you i havent had the opportunity to meet yet before i get into the  numbers and given this is the first time im in front of you in this job i would like to share a few thoughts about my approach you may know ive already spent years with this firm running various businesses including as ceo of the middle east and most recently coceo of global banking and markets but what you may not know is that i spend most of this time creating efficiencies to achieve the purpose of investing in growth so indeed i oversaw the sales of nonstrategic businesses in the middle east and this allowed us to focus our investments into saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and when i led gbm with greg i drove the rationalization of our product line and booking structure to focus on the areas where we had competitive advantage and could best serve our clients so as a result i materially reduced rwas and costs and repurposed those saves to invest in technology for the future of the business i believe therefore the growth cannot be achieved without a clear focus on our strength therefore purposeful transformation and elimination of areas of marginal impact are paramount equally and as importantly clinical delivery and keeping a tight grip on spending are key to unlocking the potential to invest so as i approach this next phase i want to emphasize my three focus areas so one continuing to support our business to deliver growth and returns which is underpinned by improving continuing to improve customer service and attracting and retaining talent number two is continuing to generate the further efficiencies required to support the investment i just spoke about and number three therefore the guiding principle that supports all of this will be absolute cost and capital discipline ill turn now to the  numbers reported profits before tax were at billion up on last years fourth quarter adjusted profits before tax were at billion up adjusted revenues were up driven mainly by net interest income growth of and higher nonnet interest income we booked an expected credit loss charge of billion in the quarter and then adjusted costs were up due to higher technology spend and higher performancerelated pay compared to the previous quarter lending and deposits were both down but this was largely due to our banking operations in canada being reclassified as held for sale so if you excluded this lending was down mainly due to subdued conditions in hong kong and deposits were up for the full year the dividend is at per share with a second interim dividend of per share also after strong capital generation and lower currency adjusted rwas our cet1 ratio was at an increase of basis point on the third quarter our effective tax rate for was at this includes credits from the recognition of deferred tax asset related primarily in the uk as well as other deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position reassessments if you excluded these credits then the effective tax rate for was and we expect our normalized effective tax rate for to be around this slide now shows another strong adjusted revenue performance with overall growth of compared to the fourth quarter of driven mostly by recent rate levels there was strong growth in all businesses noel hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 indicated wealth and personal banking revenues up commercial banking up and global banking and markets up net fee income was down this was mainly due to number one lower wealth distribution revenue driven by lower equities turnover in hong kong in general and mutual fund sales and this is reflecting soft equity markets in general yeah and two lower capital markets and advisory activity which also impacted global banking and markets on this slide you can see that reported net interest income was at billion up on last years fourth quarter the net interest margin was at basis points up basis point on the third quarter of and up basis points on the fourth quarter of we continue to guide to a full year net interest income of at least billion on an ifrs basis let me unpack this a little bit our guidance therefore is unchanged to what we indicated at quarter three we do view this as a conservative guidance given current fx rate tailwinds and the strong fourth quarter performance so this is why were emphasizing on at least billion its very important and there are a number of factors that we need to be aware of which is driving us to be conservative in our approach first one is the potential lag effect of customer migration to time deposits the second one is the competitive pressures we may be facing in deposit pricing and the third one is obviously the impact of foreign exchange and future rates outlook we do not consensus and were not seeking to change it we will be updating you on this nii performance throughout the year starting at the  results when we will also incorporate the impact of ifrs in our guidance we retained a cautious outlook on loan growth in the short term but continue to expect midsingledigit percentage annual loan growth in the medium to long term historically our earnings have been very sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements and we have started to address this lately with additional structural hedging positions given the current rate levels we will also update you i will certainly update you later in the year on the progress towards this net interest income stabilization or mitigation turning to credit our fourth quarter ecl charge was billion which includes billion for our mainland china corporate real estate exposure if you excluded this portfolio the ecl charge was billion or around basis points of loans with limited signs of credit deterioration so our main indicators therefore are still holding up given the macroeconomic headwinds we expect an ecl charge of around basis points for the full year our ecl charge as a percentage of average loans includes loan balances held for sale from the planned sales of canada and france retail therefore when you exclude them you need to add another to basis point on top of that number i do get a lot of questions on mainland china exposure mainland china corporate real estate specifically so in the spirit of transparency and having done a lot of work at the dynamics of this portfolio let me zoom in and walk you through that logic first our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in hong kong the onshore portfolio is performing and the security is working the exposure booked in hong kong reduced by around in the second half of the year from billion at  to billion and this is primarily due to repayments hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 in  we did see some further deterioration in that sector so we looked at the portfolio again and decided to increase the share of substandard and credit impaired exposures to around of that portfolio thats up from around at  and by doing so we increased our provisions accordingly so now if you zoom in on the billion exposure that we now rate as substandard or credit impaired billion is secured with minimal ecl due to the security held so then against the remaining billion we are holding billion of provision circa coverage ratio and within this our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit impaired exposure is around ph we also run a number of downside scenarios and ive included some of that analysis in the deck which we can discuss in qa if you wish to but to be clear we did not need to factor those downside scenarios on the 31st of december number and since then our view of the sector has become more positive following more accommodative policy stance that weve been seeing so we are currently comfortable with our coverage level but we will continue to monitor the situation very closely okay ill move on to costs now fourth quarter operating expenses were up on the same period last year as most of the cost saves were broadly offset by technology spend and higher performancerelated pay the uk bank levy for was offset by credits from overpayments we made related to prior years we expect an annual charge of around million for rebasing prior year costs at constant currency for hyperinflation economies and thats specifically turkey and argentina added around million of cost growth to our adjusted cost base so around half of the increase and when youre comparing to our formal cost to achieve transformation program what we called cta program is now complete we did achieve billion of gross cost saves which was somewhat at the top of our expectations with an associated cost to achieve spend of billion which was towards the lower end of our guided range as noel said were still seeking and finding opportunities to create efficiencies that will deliver sustainable cost saves in future years the costs thereof will be above the line and were now considering up to million of additional costs for severance in this will enable us to take out further management layers these costs will be reported in our costs line taking this into account were now aiming for approximately cost growth in which remains a tough target in a high inflation environment you should probably expect our costs to be marginally higher in  as were absorbing the rundown of the residual costs from the cost to achieve program just to notice i move on to capital now and the three points i wanted to call out here is first our cet1 ratio at up basis point on the previous quarter is mainly due to a billion capital benefit from higher profits and lower fx adjusted underlying rwas second were back within our cet1 ratio target operating range which remains for the medium term the intention is to manage this range further down from medium to longer term and given now we have returned to our target operating range six month earlier than we initially indicated we have brought forward the consideration of future buybacks to the  results and finally on the proceeds generated by the planned sale of our canada banking operations subject to the completion of the transaction of course we anticipate three potential uses one a special dividend of per share which will be the first priority use two well consider additional buybacks over and above any existing buyback program and three well retain capital as required within the business and we will update you on these later in the year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 finally on guidance we are reiterating our guidance of at least billion of net interest income for we remain on track to deliver a return on tangible equity of at least from onwards and as i explained we are now targeting approximately cost growth in our capital allocation target for asia remains unchanged at now given the changes in the macroeconomic environment together with the ifrs we do not intend to continue to track insurance and fees as a percentage of group revenue nor wealth and personal banking as a percentage of group tangible equity needless to say these businesses remain absolutely strategically important and we remain absolutely committed to growing them in summary this was a good set of results weve had revenue growth from all businesses but we want to further increase and broaden revenues while protecting net interest income we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers through high quality proposition and our multichannel international distribution network and as i said at the beginning i have three focus areas supporting the businesses to deliver growth and returns continuing to generate further efficiencies and a strict cost and capital discipline higher returns in will give us substantial distribution capacity in the future dividend payout ratio has been established for and we will return to quarterly dividends from quarter one considerations of buybacks have been brought forward to the quarter one results and we have signaled a per share special dividend as the first priority use of proceeds generated by the planned sale of hsbc canada all followed by increased investment in growth and further buybacks in and subject of course to continued strong capital efforts with that ill ask richard to take us to qa thank you very much question and answer section operator thank you mr elhedery operator instructions at this point i will hand the call over to mr richard oconnor who will host the qa richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you operator and good morning everyone as per normal for these live events well take a few questions from the floor to start with and then well go to the telephones and then back to the floor as ever please give your name and institution those in the auditorium please wait for the mics to come around and please stick to a maximum of two questions per person and if youve got more than that well obviously try and come around again towards the end of the qa session with that ill start with omar and then martin omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning its omar keenan from credit suisse thank you for the presentation i had questions on net interest income please i was wondering if you could talk us a little bit through how the published rate sensitivities have changed versus what was published at the interim results it looks like theres been some quite significant changes and it might be impacted by the nii stabilization program that you talked about so that would be really helpful hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 and then my second question just when we think about the recommencement of the buyback given the good capital performance when we think ahead to the first quarter how should we think about how youll manage within the to range can we consider that any capital generation that lets the group land north of might be say paid down to the midpoint or something like that that would be quite helpful thanks noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks omar and let me just give a couple of quick comments on before we go into the detail on rate sensitivity just on nii because just to reinforce some of the comments that georges made listen our guidance is unchanged quarter to quarter i think its important to keep it pretty consistent but i do want to emphasize what georges said its at least billion we do note that consensus is higher than billion consensus currently is around billion georges said earlier were not looking to move consensus were comfortable with where consensus is as georges said there are three factors that will play out over the next few weeks and months and they are deposit migration competitive pressures and foreign exchange that will determine exactly what we mean by at least but well update on that each quarter but i just want to reiterate were not looking to change consensus from its current level in the market and then on the nii sensitivity or the rate sensitivity georges do you want to just explain how that shift has taken place georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel thanks omar so if you look at the downside basis point shift nii sensitivity were reporting now billion you may have kind of a record of billion previously the reduction is mainly due to two factors twothird of it is due to the rate level changing obviously the higher the rates the less youre compressed by the zero downside challenge and onethird is due to the additional structural hedging we have started putting on we probably expect that onethird proportion to increase as we go forward if you look at the upside the number is billion basis point up id caution you that this number is somewhat theoretical ie were assuming betas and no balance sheet change so no deposit migration et cetera so we know that the real upside for higher rates will be lower than this will obviously be higher than where we are today but lower than the billion addition because you have to factor in a natural deposit migration and probably higher betas than at the next juncture of rate increases on your second question were not giving an exact target were just stating a range to were leaving it to our judgment and obviously relevant approvals to assess what is excess capital beyond that but is not necessarily the lower bound right its a range and therefore its not a lower bound at which we judge excess capital richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 yes good morning im martin leitgeb from goldman sachs could i just have one on nii and one on growth and just in terms of net interest margin a strong progression again quarteronquarter both in hong kong so hbap and the uk ringfenced bank i was just wondering could you give us a steer on how you think on the shape of net interest margins on these two core businesses going forward should we expect a broad picture of stability from here in terms of hedge providing further tailwind hopefully helping to offset migration and would you expect the impact of deposit migration to be fairly frontend loaded into or could this be a longerterm process and secondly on growth the improved and higher profitability outlook as we head into a better capital position and also some of the disposal proceeds from canada being earmarked for growth and investment i was just wondering what growth opportunities are you most excited about and how to square it up with the kind of guidance for lowsingledigit growth this year thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah let me deal with the second one first and then georges can come back and add any flavor on deposit migration listen i think with the economic uncertainty there exists around the world at the moment i think it is wise to be cautious on expecting too much underlying growth particularly i think in the demand for term lending from corporates i think theyre in a cautionary mode at the moment so thats why were saying were not expecting in the near term a significant growth particularly in the demand for term lending i still think this growth potential in working capital finance trade a lot will depend on global gdp thats why were sort of saying being a little bit more cautious near term whilst also seeing once we get through those uncertainties therell be growth potential beyond that what ill also say though its not equal and its not even were seeing a very strong business performance in the middle east at the moment were seeing good growth there were still gaining market share in mortgages granted the market in the uk has shrunk for mortgages probably around about but were still seeking to grow market share and we can do so wisely and safely im still seeing very strong business activity levels in india its a strong market with good growth potential and hong kong is rebounding not yet translating into i think demand for term lending from corporates but we are seeing some early signs in january of wealth activity starting to increase as the border with china opened up and economic activity in hong kong opened thats particularly focused more on investors willing to invest in sort of the debt markets and structured products rather than equity i think theyre waiting to see how the equity markets move forward and i think china we delivered billion of profit in china last year adjusted profit so thats a good outcome and that was in a tough year and so i am expecting economic rebound in china it will not be unaffected by the global slowdown so i think were well positioned if theres growth in the world through our asia franchise our international franchise and middle east were well positioned but its hard to predict exactly how much growth will be in the economy so wed rather be a bit cautious in terms of linking it to canada listen weve been quite clear in that our preferred use our prime priority use of the proceeds of canada the first priority use will be a special dividend of and i think you can understand why were doing that the cancellation of the dividend for our retail shareholders was a very significant event a few years ago and we want to try and put that right with the canada transaction once that closes hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 the balance of the rest of the proceeds between retention and buyback we havent formed a view on at this point in time well look at that at the circumstances when the canada transaction closes it will be a combination probably a buyback and some retention but im not giving guidance at this stage on what the balance is georges do you just want to add any further comments on nii im going to reiterate for the avoidance of doubt were not seeking to move guidance on nii we tend not to give guidance on nim georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel martin so just a couple of comments that probably will help you figure it out the first one is deposit migration and passthrough is already happening so we are already starting to see it all the way from  on that point in hong kong the market tracks deposits and term deposits were substantially below the market but were tracking along kind of directionally same as the market in the uk weve already increased our rates about times so in the last year so it kind of reflects this so it is already happening the second thing i wanted to say is that we havent seen such speed in rate hikes and such level of rates for a couple decades now which means however much we build and evaluate our forecasts on expected customer behavior and competitive pressures we dont know and this is why we wanted to stay somewhat conservative but we are conservative for those reasons to assess that but third i think this is many of the proposition we have in both hong kong and the uk since you called out these markets is leading many of our most of our customer deposits our transactions and operating accounts which means we do expect stronger performance than what you may see as markets numbers the one thing i just want to call out in hong kong to be mindful of is hibor which is obviously a leading indicator of nii performance in hong kong has moved all the way to and dropped all the way to where i think is around today there is a shortterm headwind on nii due to that but this is only a we believe its only a shortterm headwind due to inflows into hong kong and that will resolve itself noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and i think thats a positive because whats happening in january what were seeing is an inflow of capital back into hong kong seeking opportunities for growth that has temporarily we believe suppressed hibor a bit but its for a good reason not a bad reason next question richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc next question from aman and then andrew behind and then well go to the phones after that aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning its aman rakkar from barclays hi noel hi georges ive just got a question on revenue but principally around noninterest income i think youre selling yourself a little bit short today around the revenue guidance theres a lot of focus on net interest income in the billion guide but my understanding is that that includes a much bigger trading interest expense than the kind of numbers you were calling out in  hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 i think you told us to kind of factor in a greater the billion drag in but it looks like thats annualizing much north of billion so it looks like the net interest income that youre calling out has a much bigger negative in it and i guess the assumption would be that there would be some positive trading income on that trading interest expense which presumably is a big positive for noninterest income i wouldnt want you to audit my spreadsheet but i think i can get to a noninterest income number somewhere between billion and billion noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i was going to say an exaccountant i dont think youre ever an exaccountant but im probably not topical but i like your double entry so yes theres a doubleentry effect and georges will explain the double entry georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so your analysis is correct as a short answer just to unpack it a little bit the earnings from lending to the trading books in global banking and markets are not booked in nii theyre booked in nonnii due to the accountings those earnings for last year accounted for billion in the nonnii line of that billion billion was generated in  obviously with the rate level of  with the assumption that the money the bank lends to the trading books and global banking and markets stays where it is today and the rates stay where they are today then it is not unreasonable to assume you can annualize the  billion for the full year and therefore yes you will be a couple billion up yearonyear on the nonnii part which is related to funding the trading books noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so a good analysis fair observation aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you very much i guess the related question would then be because noninterest income is a messy line i know youve got ifrs which youre going to come back to us on can you help us understand yearonyear the two big drivers of fee income i guess gbm and wealth management is your best guess gbm is up year onyear kind of whats your best take on the kind of underlying fee income in the business yearonyear noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc well first of all on gbm i think we as probably the markets have seen a strong level of activity in january has been particularly so in the debt capital markets but weve seen a strong january will that sustain through the year is too early to predict but good activities good pipeline on wealth i said earlier i think weve seen some early signs of wealth having a positive january in hong kong in particular one should assume that positiveness should accelerate but its hard to know exactly by what rates and i think equities will equity investment will lag investment in the bond markets and the debt markets but i think they are going to be the two drivers hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 we got to keep with the fee income growth in global payments and foreign exchange and trade that bedrock that weve had last year thats grown around cagrs of per annum for the past three years will continue were not going to lessen our focus on that but it should be supplemented by greater levels of activity in gbm and in wealth is there anything you want to add or georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc i mean look were not guiding towards fee income but if you unpack every component of fee income theres an area of strategic focus and growth so clearly subject to market conditions you know where our investments are going and clearly fee income earning businesses is a key priority as noel was indicating earlier yeah aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc and let me just provide you andrew and then well go to tom on the phones andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you its andrew coombs from citi i guess ill carry on working down the pl so one on costs and one on provisions previously on the cost guidance you talked about this billion of cost saves cost saves inflation net and now today theres the million severance taking you up to cost growth just thinking more about the medium term your messaging was no easing up on cost discipline and saves but obviously the severance charges are somewhat lower than the cta that you booked last year so presumably the attached cost savings are going to be lower than what you had as a tailwind following through into this year so when we think about the cost base in the medium term and the underlying growth run rate obviously inflation dependent but did you see it slightly higher than or do you think is kind of a mediumterm run rate noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc were not giving guidance on costs at this point in time i think its too early i think we got to see where we go to on the inflation curve for the rest of the year theres good progress on inflation but its still unpredictable on your point which i do want to come back on our investment in technology continues were now at of our total cost base in tech that technology is improving customer propositions but its also improving processes digitizing processes more and more we have a longterm program of cost takeout over the future years and thats already underway from the it investment thats already embedded in our plan that would generate cost savings on a recurring basis as we digitize so i dont always need severance to get cost savings because i got it investment to give me some cost savings and that is going to be a continuum now clearly the more notice you have on that the more ability to achieve that without severance because you can do natural attrition hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 typically the attrition rate in processing centers and in much of the cost base could be per annum attrition some places could be as high as per annum attrition so you have lead time ability to reposition your head count without the need for severance as those processes are reengineered and were going to be doing more of that going forward and therefore not have to call on things like cta in the quantum we called on it in the past three years and i want to forget cta thats now history and were just embedding cost savings as part of the fundamental architecture of the business going forward hopefully thats answered your question on cost andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd it does indeed and then on provisions thank you for providing the additional disclosure on chinese commercial real estate the billion plausible downside that you provided on the hong kong booked chinese commercial real estate positions just so we have an understanding you talk about as plausible downside is that or isnt that baked into your overall basis points guidance is the bps the base case without that billion just so we understand noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc well let me give you an opening comment and then georges can add some flavor look we run that plausible downside as at 31st of december without knowledge or the benefit of the positive policy moves that took place in january so its a likeforlike we topped up the provisions we thought the provisions were appropriate we decided to do some scenario analysis thats the result of the scenario analysis we didnt think that scenario required to be provided against or we would have put it in the balance sheet we decided that was not required we had sufficient coverage but we wanted to run a scenario that said what is the plausible downside if things continue to get worse and that scenario has existed in  continued into since then positive measures have happened particularly the provision of liquidity to the offshore market and the rebooting of the china economy postcovid that you could argue in my terminology as changed the dynamics of that plausible downside either the probability of it or the quantum of it but weve not rerun it it is what it was at 31st of december and what we try to give you is a scoping of what could happen if things continued the way they were now im not going to answer the question is it in the basis points or isnt in the basis points we feel comfortable whether its looking at the global economy our uk business our hong kong business china commercial real estate were guiding you to an overall bad debt an ecl charge of around basis points the composition of which were not going to blow out into any finer detail but to the extent its not needed for china real estate for that plausible downside it gives us more cover elsewhere so like is there anything i should you want to add georges georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc no no i think noel covered it exactly i mean just kind of to be very clear it is a downside it is not a forecast were very comfortable where we are now in terms of provisioning and we have not factored billion in the basis points so its not so again this is a downside hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 i think just kind of zooming in on one thing weve given you a grid to be able to do your own assessment we have our own views on ecls and china real estate and the outlook and how the sector could evolve but weve unpacked the portfolio in a way that allows you to do your own scenario so you know what weve classified the subimpaired substandard and credit impaired and thats of the offshore portfolios as quite weve taken quite a robust view there youve seen the level of provisions we associated if you wanted to increase an ecl coverage you can come up with an equivalent scenario and you can kind of land on that plausible downside by just making your own assumptions about loss given default on this subset of the portfolio richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc well now go to the phones operator well take three questions to start with from the phones thank you operator operator thank you our next question comes from guy stebbings of bnp paribas your line is now open guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi morning afternoon thanks very much for taking the questions firstly on net interest income and then a sort of quick followup on impairments just in sort of hong kong specifically its good nii management in the quarter but youre flagging sort of further negative deposit mix ph hibor drifted lower and lending conditions have been subdued just want to get a sense if you think nii in hong kong specifically should rise from  run rate or whether were kind of capped out there we need hibor to really ph wreak up with us rates to get nii to move from the  run rate and sort of linked to that in terms of deposit mix and deposit beta in your two largest markets hong kong and uk youre obviously further ahead in that journey in hong kong is the guidance from here predicated on a greater headwind coming in hong kong or uk when you think about deposit mix and beta specifically and then just a quick followup on impairments youve nudged up the guidance and now expect to be above normalized but appreciate your comments just now that you dont want to get into all the detail in terms of composition there but i just wondered if you can share any color on which markets do you think theres a bit more of a risk about being above normalized cost of risk or put it another way any markets youre incrementally more cautious since  results thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc georges do you want to take it georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you guy so on hong kong deposits first the hyper impact we believe is short termish and this is a correction as noel was explaining earlier but you also have to look at what additional deposits this may mean for us so were looking at this obviously its a headwind for nii its certainly a tailwind for the economic outlook of hong kong its growth and the capability of growing the overall deposit and loan pool so this is why were yet to really seeing how the impact of the shortterm hibor is going to be hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 in terms of deposit mix and this is valid for both hong kong uk deposit mix and betas this is happening already as i did say we are substantially better than the market averages that are reported due to the nature of the deposits we have they are mostly operating in transaction deposits and we already factored in our guidance the fact that we will see additional or continuation of these migrations taking place so were very mindful that it will happen and were factoring it in the level of uncertainty we have is how much more or less visàvis our own guidance is going to have in the uk as i said earlier weve already increased rates times you should expect that any basis point higher from here will see marginally higher betas than the one we experienced before but thats just the nature of how your passthrough rates will work both for us and for the rest of the market and thats exactly also how we are factoring in our guidance on the ecl risk do you want to take noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah ill cover it i mean the ecl risk listen the obvious market that you maybe would ask questions on is the uk weve talked a lot about china real estate the obvious and ive already said the south and southeast asia is performing well middle east is performing well we have principally in europe an international wholesale corporate book and in the us an international wholesale corporate book so not exposed to retail credit pressures there so that brings you to the uk and id say on the uk at the moment were not seeing any signs of stress at the moment of any significance outside of normality in uk retail banking i think its performing well the mortgage book is holding up well im not seeing any major signs of stress in our book im not saying the market isnt stressed but i think in our book were comfortable and were much smaller in unsecured lending than many of our uk competitors but again were not seeing any major signs of stress in the uk unsecured book retail unsecured book it is fair to say that uk corporates particularly smaller corporates to middle market corporates the inflationary pressures are having a negative impact on cash flow but again id say thats marginal deterioration in our book at the moment its not material deterioration its understandable pressures so were not seeing that turning the corner into very negative territory at all at the moment now well have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year but if i look at the basis points and you look at the pockets of where there are potential ecl charges could come from weve given you a view on china real estate that says theres still a way to go for the uk china real estate market to get back to a level of normality but its turned the corner and its in positive territory but theres still some way to go so theres some potential usage of the basis points there theres some potential usage of the basis points in the uk but at the moment it would be normal usage levels in the uk which may be some possibly slightly higher usage levels in smaller to midmarket corporates but its marginal at the moment and then the rest of the world id put in normal to positive territory middle east is experiencing a very strong economy at the moment so id say you could argue our normal range is between and basis points were trying to be a bit more cautious and position you at basis points because of the uncertainty in the world richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks very much next question operator hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 operator thank you your next question comes from tom rayner of numis your line is now open tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes thank you good morning noel good morning georges can i maybe have another crack at trying to get you to comment on the mediumterm cost guidance if i take the guidance for of plus and strip out the impact of the severance and the normalization of the uk bank levy and i strip out the billion of flowthrough from previous cost savings i think that sort of becomes more like an underlying to please correct me if you disagree but my question would be is to a fair sort of view of what the underlying sort of cost pressures are as we go into before any further incremental cost savings that may or may not come through bearing in mind that noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc nice try to get me to give you updated guidance on but im not going to the one thing i will reiterate for you though its just to help we have programs running that are part of business as usual through digitization through technology through simplification process reengineering that you should expect that we will always have an element of cost savings coming through as part of continuing to drive efficiency and i will use some of those cost savings to mitigate some of the inflationary impacts that exist in the environment but im not going to quantify that tradeoff between inflation and constant reengineering but i think youre wrong to assume in your arithmetic that you just had that weve stopped trying to drive efficiency through we will always try to drive some level of efficiency into the cost base as a mitigant against some of the inflationary pressures so i wouldnt flow it all the way through necessarily into your models as a oneforone calculation but im not giving guidance at the moment on or other than cost discipline remains a core georges do you want to add anything georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah just want to just make sure you get the numbers right so the bank levy benefit ie the credits is a benefit we have said we are expecting normalization of the bank levy to circa million for and this is already baked into our cost guidance so were not getting the benefit has kind of past its in the number already and we banked it renew it and therefore for you should strip it out its already in our cost guidance the second one is the cost saving flowthrough will manifest this year in additional payrelated inflation of the overall pay pool again as noel indicated when youre looking beyond you have to assess how inflation outlook is during the course of we think the outlook is improving and we think weve already baked into our pay the effect of the inflation that weve suffered including some doubledigit jurisdiction inflation et cetera so thats not necessarily a repeat beyond at least not to the same extent but i also want to just clarify the hyperinflation impact on cost is not budgeted we do not in our view this is not a real cost growth this is just an arithmetic growth that comes from rebasing prior year costs under our constant hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 currency reporting so therefore we have not planned for it we cannot manage it we do not think this is or were not our view is this is not real cost growth and we have not factored in so just a clarification there richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc we got time for two more questions only im afraid manus and jason from the lines and then noel will wrap up so over to next question from manus please operator manus your line is now open manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi its manus costello from autonomous thanks richard just wanted to a couple of questions please firstly to follow up on amans question you confirmed that there is over billion of yearonyear benefit into noninterest income from the indiscernible and i think you had about billion or over billion of ph hits on noninterest income about this year marktomarkets insurance et cetera so youve already said consensus nii doesnt need to change ph but if i just piece nii not changing and operator many apologies thats a bad line well take the callers contact details well move to the next question and it comes from john napier sic jason napier of ubs jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch indiscernible the first one just focusing on the united states business and sort of whats left of the north american franchise exmexico loan portfolio is really small sort of billion and the deposit books about ph billion i appreciate a lot of the business originated out of that region probably is booked elsewhere but i just wondered in terms of the overhead that resides in that jurisdiction the costincome that was delivered there last year how you think about that and whether thats appropriately scaled for the shape of the business going forward and then secondly manus question is a good one so i hope we do get back to that the second question for me would be on the capital walk quite a lot of noise in the deductions in  i just wanted to invite you perhaps to call out any sort of changes from the  end of period levels that weve got for things like dtas and expected losses and so on is there anything to flag in terms of headwinds to capital following a very good print at the full year stage thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc georges do you want to take both of those georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure so first the costincome ratio for north america as noel indicated were looking at the overall value of the franchise were looking at the business generated or the income generated by those customers sitting in north america but booked specifically in the east asia and the middle east so therefore were not commenting or managing specific legal entitys costincome ratio we will look at the profitability of clients and we will look at the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 profitability of business lines and the returns of clients and the returns of business lines when we make these assessments on the capital walk no so first dtas have been deducted from capital at least the uk dta which was the substantial one is gone a significant item and therefore not in capital and is also deducted from the dividend payout ratio other dtas fall under the threshold deductions and get deducted i dont think theres anything to worry about that its just a natural walk so therefore i dont think we have any headwinds on capital as we go into  its just about the impacts of profit generation the impacts of rwa growth for our cet1 ratio i may call it out here just to make sure that i put your minds at ease if this is coming through any impairment in bocom sitting under significant holdings if it were to be needed will result in virtually no cet1 ratio impact again due to those capital deductions and therefore would result into no impact on our dividend payout and no impact to our share buyback any share buyback program that may be running at such time of an impairment yeah so i hope i answered your question but if theres something specific you would like to address we can take it as well noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc also just on the us i just want to say that michael and the team in the us have done a great job in rationalizing the portfolio a lot of the actions theyve taken in would have a full year benefit in so i do expect the cost efficiency ratio of the us to come down from actions already taken and he still sees further opportunities to rationalize the cost base of the us so i think youll see that ratio come down over time as you start to see full year cost savings benefits hit into but hes done a great job in repositioning that portfolio over the past two to three years richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc manus dial back on lets give noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc manus richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc one more try of manus and then well wrap up noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah lets try manus again please to see if the line has got better operator manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp is that any better hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc it is thank you manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay apologies for earlier yeah i just wanted since jason liked the question i thought id try again so it was following up on the previous point about the revenue guidance there is at least billion of benefit yearover year on noninterest income from the trading book impact there are about billion of oneoff hits in noninterest income in and youve already said that net interest income youre happy with consensus being unchanged so when i look at the revenue guidance for the year it strikes me that or the revenue consensus for the year i should say it strikes me the revenue consensus is at least a couple of billion too low i wondered if you were able to comment on that because theres some confusion i think that there is a revenue downgrade coming out of this set of earnings which based on the comments youve made so far on this call doesnt seem to me to be right conclusion thank you georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you manus so your analysis is correct the first one is there is indeed a couple billion that you need to factor in in the nonnii due to the funding of the trading book assuming roughly flat balances and flat rates throughout to the  number so yes that one is correct the second one is yes fee income has been subdued in particularly in wealth and we explained the situation in hong kong earlier as well as in the capital markets and advisory activities in global banking and markets both of which do seem to reverse at least the first month of this year has been much more optimistic weve seen resumption of activity in wealth now i cant comment on the quantum of the reversal of that lost income last year but yeah your assessment is fair now all in all i cannot guide to nonnii but i think the ingredients you have here are fair to be used richard oconnor global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc with that we better wrap up back to noel to sum up please noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc well thank you very much for all of your questions and your time to close with a few comments weve completed the first phase of our transformation our international connectivity remains our greatest strength and its now underpinned by good broadbased profit generation thats a powerful combination you can see it in the strong delivery in weve also got a tight grip on costs and were on track to deliver our returns target but theres so much more we can do were well positioned to further improve growth and returns and we expect to have substantial distribution capacity for dividends buybacks and potentially a special dividend in early richard and the team are available to you if you have any further questions but in the meantime have a good afternoon or morning and thank you for being with us
