participant good morning good afternoon good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analyst webinar for hsbc holdings plcs annual results for your information this webinar is being recorded at this time i will hand over to noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good afternoon to those in hong kong and great to see you all good morning to those watching in london and around the world before george takes you through the  numbers ill make some opening comments first im really pleased with the performance that the team delivered in we reported billion of pbt for the first time ever and we delivered a return on tangible equity of or excluding material notable items hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 second there were some items in the fourth quarter which make it harder to understand the underlying performance george will take you through them in detail but i want to stress there was still good underlying growth in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of notable items and argentina hyperinflation our profit before tax was billion third we distributed billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of this included a full year dividend of per share which is the highest since and billion of share buybacks which have reduced the share count by over at completion of the current buyback fourth we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward weve announced a further share buyback of up to billion were committed to considering a special dividend of per share as a priority use of the canada proceeds subject to the completion of the transaction and we finished the year with a strong cet1 ratio of which will be further boosted by the canada deal fifth we remain committed to cost discipline we have flow through impacts of inflation on our cost this year but expect a downward trend in inflationary pressures in and beyond we continue to invest in growth opportunities and the digitization of our business to drive incremental efficiencies we remain very focused on funding much of that investment through cost saving initiatives finally we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rate environment george will take you through how we are reducing our sensitivity to rate movements and we do acknowledge the downside risk to nii but were confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver midteen returns in ill take you through some of these levers later but let me now hand over to george georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel a warm welcome to everyone here in hong kong for those of you watching in london good morning and thank you for joining our full year results call we delivered a good underlying business performance in the fourth quarter but let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was impacted by billion of notable items and a further billion from argentina hyperinflation including the more than devaluation of the peso in december let me unpack three of those notable items first we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our france retail business as signaled at the third quarter second we booked a billion of treasury disposal losses in the quarter again in line with the guidance at the third quarter to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate decreases and finally as you know each quarter we conduct a value and use test on the carrying value of our investment in bocom described in detail in our annual report and accounts following the outcomes of that test in  we took a charge of billion in the quarter against our carrying value the charge had an insignificant impact on cet1 capital and our cet1 ratio and no impact on our dividends or share buyback and just to be clear this has no impact on our strategy in mainland china has no impact on our strategic relationship with bocom and it has no impact on hsbcs or bocoms operation strategy or outlook so on a reported basis our profit before tax was billion in the fourth quarter down billion from the fourth quarter of excluding the billion impact of notable items and argentina hyperinflation our profit before tax was billion up billion versus the fourth quarter of primarily due to growth in banking nii hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 on the next slide so on a reported basis fourth quarter revenue was down billion compared to the same period last year due to the impact of notable items and argentina hyperinflation excluding these our revenue was up billion primarily banking nii the strength of our deposit franchise our access to two deep pools of liquidity in the uk and hong kong and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the more favorable rate environment on the next slide fourth quarter nii and banking nii were again impacted by argentina hyperinflation and a reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue between nii and nonnii excluding these both nii and banking nii were broadly stable on the third quarter and then was down basis points primarily due to higher time deposit costs and deposit migration in hong kong turning to the outlook taking our fourth quarter banking nii and adjusting for argentina hyperinflation and the reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue and the disposal of our france retail and canada businesses gives you an annualized run rate of just above billion that should be your starting point for modeling our banking nii we expect four key variables to drive our banking nii from that starting point in changes in interest rates the reinvestment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield deposit migration particularly here in hong kong and balance sheet movements there is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of this were guiding towards the banking nii of at least billion in this is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes and is intended to help you with your modeling we will continue updating further as the year unfolds and before turning to nonnii id like to direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide over the last months our banking and nii sensitivity has reduced by around billion more than onethird of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging subject to market conditions we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters in order to reduce our banking nii sensitivity still further nonnii was down billion compared to the same quarter last year due to notable items and argentina hyperinflation and again excluding these nonnii was up billion versus the same quarter last year this was primarily due to the revenue offset into nonnii from the central cost of funding global banking and markets trading activity which is included in banking nii earned from the cash flow hedge income reclassification between nii and nonnii i referred to previously other nonnii was up modestly versus the same quarter last year including an increase of billion in net fee income primarily in commercial banking and wealth and personal banking looking at nonnii from our two strategic activities of wholesale transaction banking and wealth in wholesale transaction banking nonnii was up on the fourth quarter of there was good growth in global payment solution and trade and in foreign exchange reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction banking capabilities as well as increased client activity and repricing initiatives this was partly offset by a relatively small decrease in security services in wealth nonnii in both asset management and private banking grew by doubledigits versus the fourth quarter of last year due to an increase in assets under management partly driven by net new invested assets however total wealth nonnii was down billion as a result of a billion correction to historical valuation estimates in our insurance business for the full year nonnii in wholesale transaction banking was billion up on and billion in wealth up hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 turning now to credit our fourth quarter ecl charge was billion primarily in wholesale this brought our full year ecl charge to billion which was basis points of average customer loans including those held for sale or basis points excluding those and within our full year guidance due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty were guiding towards ecls of around basis points for we took an ecl charge of billion for mainland china commercial real estate in the fourth quarter as part of the billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide this brought the full year charge on this portfolio to billion crystallizing the plausible downside scenario that we set out last february our main area of focus remains the portfolio booked in hong kong that exposure is now billion down billion in the quarter and down billion compared to full year we continue to monitor the sector closely and we are comfortable with our current level of provisions turning to cost full year costs on a constant currency basis were down on a target basis full year costs came in higher than our  guidance driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth quarter first the fdic special assessment which we expected to be incurred over and second the uk bank levy was higher than forecast primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years and third there was an offsetting benefit from argentina hyperinflation in the quarter looking ahead we are aiming to limit cost growth to around in on a target basis which excludes the reduction in costs from the france retail and canada disposals this will be driven by the flowthrough impact of inflation to costs investment and volume growth and partly offset by cost saving initiatives on the next slide customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter once you exclude the sale of our france retail business without that there was billion of deposit growth of which billion was in asia with around half of this in hong kong deposit growth in asia benefited from seasonality and we would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of  turning now to capital our cet1 ratio at the end of was which was down percentage points on the third quarter there are three things id like to draw your attention to first as i said earlier the bocom charge had an insignificant impact on cet1 capital and our cet1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory capital threshold deductions and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks second we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around basis points on our cet1 ratio in the first quarter of and finally we expect the canada sale to generate around percentage points of cet1 in the first quarter of we remain committed to consider a per share special dividend in the first half of as a priority use of the sale proceeds which equates to around percentage points of cet1 before i hand back to noel i am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our international disclosures there are two sets of data and noel will also comment further on them starting with our wholesale business let me walk you through the data on this slide in we generated billion of client revenue across commercial banking and global banking and markets of this billion was generated from multijurisdictional clients by this we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market the charts on the right show that twothirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from providing them with services in markets outside their home market where they also bank with us it is also worth pointing out that twothirds of multijurisdictional client revenue or billion was generated from client whose home market is in the west with the remaining billion from clients whose home market is in the east turning hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 now to wpb international revenue more than billion or of our wpb revenue comes from international customers around twothirds of which is generated in asia so to summarize both the wholesale and wpb client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our international network and our unique capability to serve international clients our network and further investments into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital fastgrowing segment let me now hand back to noel noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks georges thank you georges youve just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth quarter and george has introduced more detail information about our international revenue our wholesale international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale and in recent years we have started to develop and invest in our wpb international business model what georges slide showed is that already of wpb revenue comes from international customers and we believe we can take it much further so let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth not just this year and next but over the next three to four years as always ill begin with our purpose ambition strategy and values these have helped to drive the good underlying business growth which alongside supportive interest rates have given us strong momentum in the short term were conscious of the potential downside risk to nii the structural hedging we have put in place will help to protect that income but we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars which i will cover on the following slides starting with focus and our international wholesale business which remains our biggest competitive advantage and because of its scale our biggest growth opportunity in the past our businesses in the west were primarily focused on domestic clients over the last four years we have repositioned those businesses to align them with our international strategy exiting lowreturn and lowgrowth domestic rwas the result is the differentiated model you see today in commercial banking we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies which is what hsbc was founded to do the result was the billion of profit before tax that commercial banking generated last year in global banking and markets i believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between west and east which was evident in our marketleading performances in markets like the middle east and businesses like global foreign exchange we have clearly got a strong international franchise as you can see we facilitated more than billion of trade last year with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for hsbc we ranked second globally by revenue in our payments business and processed around trillion of electronic payments and weve been number three globally by revenue in fx since but i believe there is significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for which can drive revenue growth in the face of declining interest rates importantly this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on gdp as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base and it is often feebased and strongly influenced by opportunities that are inherent to our international nature of our client base hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 to provide some evidence of this growth potential we grew wholesale multijurisdictional client revenue by in and the revenue multiplier for multijurisdictional corporate clients in commercial banking was five times that of an average domesticonly customer im pleased that international isnt just a wholesale story we are doing more with our wpb customers as well building our wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services especially here in asia has been a strategic priority in recent years so im pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of billion last year compared to billion in and billion in this is a good indicator of future revenue opportunities which again is often fee income and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes another trend is the growing demand for seamless crossborder banking services innovation is key here and we hadnt innovated enough in this space in the past which meant we werent offering our customers what they wanted but we are now global money has more than million customers up from a year ago we also launched a new strengthened international banking proposition overall we grew revenue from wpb international customers by last year from billion to billion and while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates im pleased to say there was a jump in newtobank international wpb customers last year again these are higher revenuegenerating customers bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domesticonly customer next is the continued growth in our two home markets our leading propositions in hong kong and the uk provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition these two pools of liquidity underpin our exceptionally strong balance sheet which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide hong kong and the uk are both highly connected global financial centers we have increased our marketleading share of trade finance in hong kong by percentage points over the last three years this included a percentagepoint increase last year alone we are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent population in hong kong and mainland china continues to grow driven by rapid urbanization across mainland china and the increased use of the connect schemes between mainland china and hong kong we grew newtobank retail customers in hong kong by over the last three years including by capitalizing on the significant increase of visitors from mainland china postreopening in the uk we also have good traction in commercial banking in we were the number one bank for uk large corporates as well as the best bank in the uk for smes according to euromoney and we are continuing to grow in wealth and personal banking we attracted over million newtobank customers in the uk last year and weve had steady mortgage growth increasing our market share of uk stock to as economic conditions improve and we continue to invest were re confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas next i showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how weve gone from a business that depended on our home markets for the vast majority of our profits while the rest of the franchise underperformed to one with broad based profitability across markets this slide shows the increasing profitability of these diversified growth opportunities the number one ranking speak for themselves and i especially want to call out the great work that the global banking and markets team are doing in the middle east they now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities going forward india mainland china excluding associates and singapore all contributed more than billion of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 profits in with singapore doing so for the first time this underlines why hsbc was named best bank in asia by euromoney but there was strong growth across all these markets the next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of underperformance andor lower strategic priority over the last months weve announced exits in a number of our smaller markets this is one way that we expect to take out further costs alongside our continued focus on improving the internal efficiency of the bank and by making savings we can invest in the areas on the left that help us to drive growth before i move on i want to mention svb uk everyone knows that hsbc is an international bank but we also have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs and the acquisition of svb uk enabled us to build a bigger proposition and can help us to become known as the goto bank for innovation companies its encouraging that innovation banking had its bestever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of im also encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities crossborder the next slide sets out how were investing in technology to make customer experiences better so our process is more efficient and our cost of execution lower im pleased to see more of our personal and corporate customers are mobile and digitally active hsbc has traditionally grown by crossselling products to our existing banking clients but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer footprint zing is one such growth avenue because it offers crossborder payment capabilities but critically it is targeted at nonhsbc customers our embedded finance joint venture announced with tradeshift last year is another such growth avenue its still early days for both but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model i will also briefly cover our final two pillars there isnt a conversation i have with a client where the net zero transition doesnt come up our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale it will be a complex journey but we have exactly the right geographic footprint where the need and opportunity are greatest finally energize over the last four years weve increased the pace of execution across the organization the management team is confident about the business but its even more important that our colleagues are confident because when they are we stand a much greater chance of succeeding so im pleased that our staff survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impacts of our strategy was up percentage points from to and im also very excited by the number of quality new hires weve been able to bring into the organization over the last months its also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have built over the last four years in summary i will go back to what i said at the start im really pleased with how we performed in and the contribution that our people made we reported billion of pbt for the first time and a midteens rote there was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of notable items and argentina hyperinflation our profit before tax was billion we distributed billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of this included the best fullyear dividend since and three share buybacks and we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward we remain committed to cost discipline and we expect a further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rate environment were confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver midteens returns in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 with that let me hand over to neil for qa neil sankoff global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks noel noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks question and answer section neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc if you are dialed into the call and you want to ask a question please use the raise hand feature in zoom make sure your camera is and microphone are turned on and wait for the prompt for the people in the room please wait for the microphone and make sure to state your name and the name of your institution before asking your question well start with questions in the room okay gurpreet gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you gurpreet sahi from goldman two questions if i may please the first one is on fy and beyond we note that the rote guidance for this year but if there can be any comments regarding the rote for and beyond in particular if the banking nii sensitivity for the next basis points of rate cuts can be kind of guided to us the second one is around the gain the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in canadian operations and that remains at around billion of which billion can be special dividend so the billion have you decided on how much between capital distribution to shareholders and then business growth thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you very much for your questions ill ask george to cover both of those please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel thanks gurpreet so we have not at this stage given guidance for fullyear i point you to the guidance weve given for fullyear of at least billion in banking nii and midteens return on tangible equity in terms of banking nii sensitivity we do have a slide at the back end of the deck which i can point you to which shows for the further basis point and for future years whats the impact what i can point you to is number one we continue to intend to increase subject to market conditions but as of today to increase the structural hedge second the volume of the structural hedge second we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge having now reached years and with the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 intent to take it to above years both of which should give you a sense of how were mitigating rate impacts into and from the structural hedging activity with regards gain on canada so billion of proceeds billion will be considered what we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend the residual billion will constitute about additional cet1 which may which very likely will be at the  outcome we will continue looking at opportunities but it remains our intent subject to market conditions our capital position regulatory position it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buybacks beyond this one neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you any others in the room okay so well take our first question from the line will be from andrew coombs from citi noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc andrew hi andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd yeah its morning from london good afternoon to yourselves two questions please firstly i just want to clarify the messaging on the banking nii outlook if i rewind months ago i think you gave guidance for greater than billion of reported nii but then this time a year ago you said you werent seeking to move consensus which at the time was actually higher was at billion if i fastforward to today youre guiding to greater than billion if i look at consensus nii i adjust the trading book funding costs it looks like consensus banking nii is around billion so are you seeking to rebase consensus banking nii or should we put greater emphasis on your greater than within that billion target so thats my first question i just want to clarify that messaging my second question is around the hedge thank you for the extra disclosure on the billion nominal and the years average life can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also what its currently rolling off at and what youre aiming to roll it back on at if you are extending the duration out thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think george will answer both of those indiscernible georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so thank you andrew so obviously today we cannot see consensus banking nii and basically ill use this opportunity to ask you collectively if you can start giving us your banking nii consensus so we can see the nii forecasts and then the funding cost of the trading book gets lumped together with the nonnii and its to be fair difficult for us to unpack it although billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 but let me take a step back and just walk you through how were thinking about nii and just bear with me for minutes but i think that explanation would probably help guide you so we start from the  billion banking nii we would adjust then  for the parts related to argentina hyperinflation as well as the reclassification of the cash flow hedges between nii and nonniii well adjust for the part that does not pertain to  so thats a full year correction and thats about an additional billion you could use on the  billion number so that takes you to billion adjusted quarterly run rate annualized taking into account day counts you get to billion from that billion remember you have to deduct the fullyear french nii france retail nii as well as three quarters from the canada nii which together combined come to about billion so billion minus billion takes you to just above billion that would be our starting position if you want in terms of an annualization of a run rate factoring in structural hedges et cetera now from that billion there are various tailwinds and headwinds we have the tailwind of reinvestment of all the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment we do have some tailwinds probably cautious on h1 but tailwinds beyond h1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth and we do have headwinds including the rate cycle if indeed we start seeing the decreases in the second half of the year and we obviously have the headwinds which we weve observed specifically hong kong around deposit migration to term deposits kind of taking all of that into account were getting to the guidance of at least billion that were comfortable sharing today with regards the structural hedge we have shared with you volume we have shared with you the weighted average life and we have shared with you now banking nii sensitivity we have not yet shared and we have not yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield but what i can you about the yield is that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates as well as the additional hedges were doing with inverted curves are all baked into our at least billion banking nii guidance noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so if i could just add a couple of comments one reason were not given a statement regarding consensus is as george says we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these annualization effects of disposals and other things and some consensus hasnt adjusted for that at the moment so i think theres a little bit of apples and pears in todays consensus position so what george is clearly trying to articulate for you is take the  adjust it for the known items get to a new starting position of billion and ph is underpinned to that starting position of billion with at least billion therefore the range of modeling is going to be somewhere between billion and billion depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds and we think that given that lack of consistency on consensus the uncertainty in the market thats probably the best way to guide you on banking nii but theres a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples basis and then the other thing no that was it thats what i wanted to say those two comments thank you indiscernible andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you both hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc well take one from the room katherine katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc welcome katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd im katherine from jpmorgan so i have two noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc katherine katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd questions here for first questions i want to clarify the midteen rotes guidance is a normalized rote that means that rote excluding canada disposal gain so i want to clarify that because if that is the case in mid teen rotes then if you look at the company compiled consensus i think the rote is then i just calculate that on a very like topdown basis excluding the disposal gain then consensus rote is roughly about midteen as well but the thing is that i think that means that the hsbc guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalized rote but i think on nii on costs nii i think in the previous questions i think there may be a bit of reset in expectation and then i think cost the cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating then that mean does it mean that you are quite optimistic on nonnii growth ie fee growth or maybe you have a different view on asset quality and hence the ecl charges i think this is the first part of the big question the second part is on bocom may i know like what trigger the billion impairment charges and as chinas yield is declining like they just announced a 25basispoint on fiveyear lpr cut in all those should we be expecting more impairments on the bocom investment so basically i want to see if there is any one time off events that triggered this impairment or if it is going to be a normalized part of the business so i think in the statement you clearly stated that that will have no impact on dividend and shareholders return i believe this is related to the billion capital deduction which you have already made on associate i think that is primarily bocom but can you explain a bit of that mechanism because i think todays share price reaction is hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 partly factoring in the kind of concern that there is a ongoing impairment on bocom that will affect the companys ability to deliver shareholders return yeah noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc great two excellent questions and youre going to get two excellent answers from george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you katherine so katherine taking them in the order you say is first midteens rote is excluding notable items therefore it is excluding the gain on canada so your calculation is correct in terms of nii and costs so couple of things to share and we recognize the cost assessment in terms of banking nii we have given the guidance here i just point you i mentioned it in my earlier speech but i just point you that our banking nii sensitivity has reduced more than by more than half from the fullyear due to among other parameters our structural hedging activity so therefore the rate impact on our banking nii is reduced commensurately equally we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start increasing which is now planned for h2 and this is why we have some positive outlook for h2 if rates decrease volume could pick up subject to economic conditions et cetera but thats the assessment we have made today and then thirdly on the nonrate sensitive earnings ive called out transaction banking and wealth earlier between them they constitute about of our nonrate sensitive earnings one has grown to and the other one has grown and therefore we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth and i didnt talk about the residual but in the residual capital market activities for instance is included and again in a different rate environment we have grounds to believe this can also pick up so yes we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue can i put you on one thing about cost we called it out for the has a flowthrough impact from inflation in experienced high inflation theres some flowthrough some adjustments including wage inflation which we anticipate to do in based on current outlook of inflation that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond without giving you any guidance for the inflationary component flowthrough into does look like easing from where we stand today looking at outlook for inflation if i move on to your second question about bocom so this is we do talk about the value in use model its following the hong kong accounting standards international accounting standards without boring you with the accounting details the ph arna has many pages which we can point you to that explain it it feeds into parameters all in the the essentially in the public domain including macro data other factors including analysts comments feeds into the model but the model is not highly intuitive but the outcome is the outcome and we have been consistently applying it for umpteen quarters now and therefore will apply it for  it is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in  we will take into account the information we receive over the course of  and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome finally capital deduction i think this is a very important point your math katherine is correct there is about billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions because they sit above our threshold therefore you could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings bocom being one of them the other one is insurance thats the two essentially indiscernible and therefore you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage yeah noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i said hed give you two excellent answers thank you thanks george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc our next question comes from joseph dickerson at jefferies noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc joseph georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc joseph we cannot hear you you may need to joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi yes yes georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes good joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd can you hear me now noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 all right sorry about that just cutting to the chase on the you hear me indiscernible georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd yeah so just cutting to the chase on some of the questions that have come through on the nii guide i think you can probably get a sense that theres some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the baseline if we work back from your kind of clean midteens roe youve given us some guidance on cost youve given us some guidance on credit its kind of getting into a baseline revenue number of about billion i think consensus is billion or thereabouts are you comfortable with that consensus number are you seeking to change that with this guide so that is question number one and question number two is why the focus on banking nii versus total nii because theres going to be as rates come down a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic because indeed if i look at your annual report youve actually got a benefit coming through in the us ph de bucket from rates falling in terms of the aggregate nii so i guess why are you trying to distinguish between those two conceptually for us because i think its again its creating a fair amount of confusion with investors noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel joe yes so i recognize your arithmetics and yes i agree with your arithmetics this being said i cannot give you guidance on total revenue otherwise ill be giving you guidance on our full profitability but we recognize your arithmetics couple of things just to highlight if you want for your consideration the first one is our guidance for banking nii is not billion its at least billion factoring in elements of uncertainty that i called out earlier thats for fullyear you do have the building blocks for cost and for ecl and then the residual part if you want of our earnings story is the nonnii component excluding the gains from canada and as i said earlier about of it is generated from transaction banking and wealth both of which do have momentum both of which are areas where we continue investing both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing and in terms of net new invested assets and we are excited about the potential of these two businesses and we believe our midteens rote is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas its based on momentum growth in these areas maybe i can point you to our net new invested assets billion for the year up from billion last year up from billion the year before so clearly were acquiring new assets but equally as youve seen asset management private banking grew doubledigit percentage points thats also partly due to the valuation hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 increase so our aum is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving which is therefore the generator of fees commensurately subject to market conditions as we go forward indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think if theres any more questions maybe we get the ir team to just work with you after the call thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks just on your second point so were guiding we would like to move to banking nii guidance we recognize last year we have moved from nii into a dual guidance of nii and funding cost of the trading book we think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate sensitive earnings through banking nii lens the kind of shift from one to the other which is a zerosum game so it moves from one to the other is reflective of business decisions as regards how much of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on various parameters including opportunities in the trading book as well as opportunities for loan growth and we would think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate basis noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc our next question comes from benjamin toms at rbc noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc benjamin hi benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd morning both thank you for taking my questions firstly on cost of risk in relation to your guidance of basis points is there still a plausible downside to this guidance or does the basis points encapsulate that plausible downside and secondly on loan growth i know youre cautious on loan growth in the first half of do you expect growth to pick up in half two but as a whole can you just confirm you expect net growth in the balance sheet it sounds like you do because you earlier described ph volumes and the potential tailwind to nii and could you narrow down how much lending we should expect for growth for this year thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you george you want to take both of those hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you benjamin so the cost of risk of basis point encapsulates everything we currently foresee in our balance sheet we have not communicated a further plausible downside on the china commercial real estate portfolio booked in hong kong because we believe at this stage that number one were well provisioned for this portfolio after the provisioning thats taken place last year and number two we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio i can point you to our exposure is now at billion thats down billion from fullyear so therefore we do not we have a reduced level of concern i can walk you through if needed the how well ecl positioning is in this portfolio but were comfortable and no additional concerns than we called out last year on the loan growth yes our expectations is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate environment becomes more supportive we would expect to see loan growth we continue to guide on a mediumterm basis to midsingledigit percentage points loan growth and balance sheet growth its very difficult to forecast what h2 will look like but that is part of our projections noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so i think our view is given the shift in the interest rate cycle and the shift in inflation well start to see more economic confidence or business confidence consumer confidence in the second half were not expecting significant growth in the balance sheet in the first half if you start to see that kick in the second half youre likely to see fullyear midsingledigit growth in youre going to see a proportion of that start to kick in in the second half of the year and then youll see it kicking in more strongly in and beyond so i think in your modeling youre probably looking at limited growth in the first half growth starting come back in the second half benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc okay our next question comes from robert noble at deutsche noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc robert hi robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag hello can you hear me hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yes georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag hi thanks for taking my questions what was the size of the hedge last year so how much is it that ramped up this year and can you give us an idea of what the currency mix of hedges and whether theres any duration differences between those currencies as well secondly what exactly is in the quarter the cash flow hedged reclassification the impact you had from transferring from nii to nonnii what exactly was that and then lastly the timing of the special dividend post the canada sale will it come with  result if the deal is announced prior to release or is it not linked to the results ph now and so on thanks noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so ph robert the weve added about billion more north of billion to our hedge this year in terms of bond notional a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional and thats on top of an billion weve added over  and starting in  in so that should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we could reasonably do in if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge in terms of duration i mean the kind of the obvious one to call out is we can certainly hedge on our weighted average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound the us dollar to some extent the euro we have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape our and this is due to structural market our hong kong dollar exposure so our hong kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower and therefore our exposure in hong kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies in terms of canada sale you could expect in  subject to completion which is now i believe which is now planned to be on track to be by the end of  we would expect to see a jump of in our cet1 ratio the special dividend which were committed to consider would happen afterwards our best estimate is h1 but frankly afterwards as soon as we can subject all necessary approvals and that will drop the cet1 by about hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 with a resulting net of around in our cet1 after the dividend we will update you at the  results about the special dividend considerations noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah its probably not possible to close at the end of march and declare in the same quarter just for accounting reasons so its likely to be close at the end of  and probably declare  and then pay following that thats likely to be the accounting requirement just to get the books closed for  and then declaring  is the most likely outcome robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag so declare in  not with  results noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc probably with  results robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag right so pay in  georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc its our intent to do it as soon as we can i can take you through the process but there is a process we have to go through and the timelines will need to just flow through but well confirm the timing at the results robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag all right thank you ph those just that one little question of what the cash flow ph had for reclassification in the quarter georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc oh sorry yeah that reclassification is an error in reporting its related to one geography where some of our cash flow hedges were booked wrongly between nii and nonnii and weve done this correction it is in it has affected one jurisdiction the amount is a full year amount so i wouldnt the billion charge weve taken reflects a full year correction of which around a fourth relate to actually the fourth quarter the rest is a catch up for the first three quarters of the year robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag all right thanks very much hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and sorry just to be clear robert the total income is not affected this is just a reclassification of income from one line item to another line item robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag got it thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc alastair alastair warr q analyst autonomous research alastair warr from autonomous noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc alastair alastair warr q analyst autonomous research just a quick question on the ecl charges and things have subsided ph a bit on the china property side obviously its nice for you guys to see but a few cracks popping up in mexico is that something you characterize as cycle stuff that might be going somewhere from here we need to keep an eye on or something a little more oneoff noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you alastair so the oneoff sorry the mexico ecl related to an increase in our activity is specifically in unsecured lending its a feature of that jurisdiction where margins are very healthy but the ecl coverage or the ecl charge tend to be a bit higher it will depend on our activity but we expect to run at a slightly higher activity in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 unsecured lending among other in mexico than we were before so i wouldnt look at it as a oneoff but obviously itll depend on the cycle noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc but its a function of doing business and growing the business as opposed to a function of a historic problem materializing georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc correct noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc our next question comes from perlie mong at kbw perlie mong q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible questions just a couple and i guess the first one is cost just what can you do with cost in the falling rate environment because youve talked about management actions and i guess the reason im asking is because this year i believe all in its about yearonyear and of course it includes a lot of one offs like levies in this quarter and svb earlier in the year but on the basis that it crept up from plus yearon year which is i think the first one you talked about for guidance to the end result being something like just wondering what levers do you have in your sort of cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint so thats number one and the second question is i think we all talk a lot about what might happen to revenues in a various rate environment but and also just thank you for the disclosures on a structural hedge but i guess stepping back a little bit from that just a couple of clarifications so in a falling rate environment how would you expect things like customer behavior to respond so things like deposit mix shift like in hong kong so i guess the mix shift towards turn happened quite a lot faster in hong kong versus the uk on the way up and is sort of still ongoing from the disclosures today so you if rates were to turn would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick or were still in a pretty high rate environment or do you still expect to mix shift to continue so or i think you talk about things like capital market might outperform in a falling rate environment so i guess on an underlying basis just how do you see that because capital markets and loan growth etcetera i guess a lot of its also to do with it underlying gdp as well and the theres still a lot of uncertainty sort of on the horizon so even if rates were to come down just how quickly do you think these benefits can come through noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 okay well tackle the cost first and then maybe we come to the revenue second and ill do a few introductory comments on how i see revenues on costs george you want to just do a quick analysis of reported costs versus target basis and then reported to target basis and i might just add a few comments to the end of that on cost levers the way i look at it but george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc very good thanks noel so on the reported basis to we were down so the growth against our target of also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs weve taken in did not repeat weve guided how the costs have increased from our initial or initial where we included severance into the obviously the ph last percent this quarter was unexpected the rules for the fdic special assessment came in november the earlier draft rules weve seen in september indicated we would be incurring that cost in and but the rules that came in november had us to have to have the different accounting treatment and accelerate all that as did all other banks who were subject to the fdic special assessment so just want to call it out that this one was a particular event we called out we as we look at it going forward for were looking at the on the target basis growth this is excluding the cost reduction we will get from exiting the french retail business and the canada business between the two of them we will be exiting on an annual basis an equivalent of billion just shy of that which is around that would be a reduction in cost of but that is excluded from the way were managing our target basis just explaining how were coming up with this cost and then noel can talk you through the levers to manage our cost so first there is this flow through inflation from there is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for based on the flow through inflation from that component we feel is easing and hopefully in the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of into the future there is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas organic growth areas thats particularly true in wealth and those spending are partly offset by the number of cost management actions some of which we have taken already such as the severance program which will have a flow through benefit into and other actions were planning to take just before noel talks to levers were looking at cost as in growth from the target basis in dollar numbers were not looking at our cost in the cost efficiency ratio basis there may be fluctuation to our revenue but frankly in the year like our cer has dropped from in to so we will tolerate some volatility on the cer as long as were managing our cost in the spend dollar basis but indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks george i know this is an important topic and let me reiterate upfront we remain committed to cost discipline the question is how are we achieving cost discipline and we obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organization we invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs and were continuing to do that we invest in simplification of the portfolio closing down businesses organically exiting costs organically but were also exiting costs through ma and in our target basis we adjust for that but i dont want you to lose sight we have exited well be exiting billion of cost in as a function of ma decisions portfolio choices made for good strategic reasons million of that was the exit of our french retail business its a business that was hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 losing money so weve exited million at cost by selling and its going to be profit accretive because that business was a loss making business weve exited million of costs in canada through selling we hope to by the end of  not tempting fate why are we doing it because that business in our hands was probably valued at around times book and we were able to generate times book as over times book we sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us and were redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholders so we do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generating cost efficiency for good strategic reasons and well continue to pull those levers now the other thing is we are we do believe an organization like ours with the growth opportunities we have we should invest and we made a decision last year on our original cost target of to actually move it up to because we were continuing to invest in tech and in tech today as part of our overall cost base is now around when i took over four years ago tech as a percent of our cost base was so were trying to remain disciplined on cost and change the nature of the cost to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies so thats sort of the thinking we have you have our absolute commitment both myself and george and the management teams we will keep cost discipline well invest and save at the same time we have to acknowledge the flow through of inflation but the other component we made a decision on in given the very very strong performance the business had we thought it was right to go from to by topping up the variable pay by an extra percent we thought that was the right decision for our people so we think its the right cost decision but it has inflated our cost compared to our original target of but i think we had to do the right thing by our people on that and then the final taken us to the number you talked about was unexpected when we talked to you in  we didnt expect that final to come through for fdic and bank levies the fdic is probably a timing issue it was going to come through in or but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year so youve got our commitment indiscernible now as i turn to revenues and let me maybe again decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of nii or interest income clearly the great work that george and the team have done on hedging and further structural hedges we put in place and the exit duration is a mitigant to the downside i look at the opportunity on the upside in two components one is our core usp of international banking we have within our franchise clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them be they personal clients or corporate clients we still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate our client base and every time you saw in the revenue multipliers we take a client to multiple jurisdictions a revenue multiplier of five times domestic revenue in wholesale banking three times domestic revenue in retail banking thats an internal generated revenue opportunity not dependent on gdp thats in our hands the second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical and i do believe ive been around years so ive seen some cycles and i do believe lower inflation leads to lower interest rates lower interest rates lead to a pickup in economic activity normally for the lag effect and i do believe that pickup will have a positive impact on capital market activity in our global banking and markets business i think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business lag effect as ive talked about hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 and thirdly i think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets and thats a huge opportunity for our wealth business and youve seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years billion billion billion thats where were very focused and a lot of our investment is going now its for us the management team to deliver on that so we know weve got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline and weve got to deliver on revenue diversification my final comment on this is im grateful that weve had four years of transformation because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus majority and were now focused on that growth opportunity and were in a fortunate position that all of the hard work of the last four years has given us that platform for growth thank you neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc so we have time for one last question then ill hand it back to you noel if you want to make any concluding remarks noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you neil sankoff a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc so our final question comes from aman rakkar at barclays aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you very much hi noel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi aman georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc ph hi aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd indiscernible i have two broad questions the first one is kind of split into two and then ive got a second question around gbm sorry sorry capital returns first broad question its around fee income so the first part of it is im a bit confused by your banking nii sensitivity you can see in slide billion on basis points rate cut but the majority of that comes from nonbanking sorry nonnii so can you help me there because i just dont understand that i thought banking nii kind of stripped out the trading funding costs so whatever color you can give us there hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 and the related question is that your outlook for fee income more broadly i get your messaging around wealth transaction banking is kind of demonstrating positive momentum but can i ask you about the other big chunk of fee income which is gbm and theres various moving parts there i suspect that you think cyclically its not earning its full amount but i also do note the global fx is kind of been decent for a while so can you give us your view on to what extent that business is operating at below or ahead of kind of capacity so that was a kind of broad twopronged question on fee income believe or not the second question was around your distribution your approach to distribution youre potentially facing down the barrel of slower volume growth in and im interested in youre arguably then going to be more capital generative this year on still decent profits and not a lot of balance sheet growth how do you approach that do you kind of give us additional buybacks through the course of this year or do you kind of hold that powder dry for bigger rebound in say thank you very much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay i think george do you want to pick up those three points georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure aman so what historically weve been giving you is nii sensitivity but as you know there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings which doesnt sit in nii it sits in nonnii under funding cost of the trading book and what weve been doing and hopefully that slide was meant to clarify it but im assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it what weve been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the nii to rates as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rates and then giving you the full sensitivity of banking nii to rates because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rates and that will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much we how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in the year it kind of cleanses that information out because its just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings that sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year in part at least for the of it due to our structural hedging activity with regards the fee income you mentioned fx having a good and decent income a couple of things about gbm to call out first the pbt of gbm was more than or higher year on year so clearly a business that increases pbt its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital something that has been not achieved for many years its above and to be also fair to gbm its return on tangible equity only increased by about because there are some corporate centerrelated adjustments which has affected them otherwise their return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of pbt growth because their rwas were down and they could have seen close to and therefore well above their cost of equity so were comfortable with how the businesses trends continue to transform itself focusing on their strength and adjusting their footprint and that momentum continues in terms of distribution well first it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of shared buybacks as long as our capital supports it and the outlook for capital does support it but this remains subject to ongoing macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals etcetera and one thing to call out with regard to our bolton acquisitions is when we look at an acquisition obviously the first parameter is making sure its a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow but the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback so were making sure that when we go for the bolton hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 acquisition the investments is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares and this is this would be a disciplined measure to make sure were doing ma that is both strategic and accretive and finally in terms of other parts of the distribution dividend payout ratio for which we reaffirmed and then if you want to give if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis our cet1 ratio it will be in the to range which we reiterate but we recognize we may not meet that target because we may be well above it for a few quarters in particular thanks to canada but also to our own capital generation aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thanks so much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc ph and the pace at which we can get back down to that target is going to be dictated by two things the capacity of the market to take buybacks and second other alternative uses of that capital to support growth but i think its fair to say theres going to be excess of our cet1 over our target range more in the near term because probably the capacity of the market to take the volume of buybacks that could be done aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much can i just to clarify so is it reasonable then to expect is it reasonable to target year on year growth in gbm ph you know the fee income business is in gbm is it noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yes aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd given the various moving parts should we think about growth georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes in the strategic area certainly i mean the areas we called out as the foreign exchange such as payments such as supporting trade we do expect also growth in as noel mentioned earlier in capital market activity if and when rates come down we see progress in this area of the fee income space clearly gbm has focused itself and the kind of the message is that in the areas where theyre focusing strategically yes in the areas where they have exited or are downsizing then these would be the nonstrategic areas that they will continue doing downsizing noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21feb2024 aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc if i could neil sankoff global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc listen i just wanted to say thank you all for joining i also want to just say look clearly im really pleased that weve had a record profit year in and the best returns that weve had for a decade really pleased we were able to reward our loyal shareholders with billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect to this included the best full year dividend since and three share buybacks we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward and we are committed to cost discipline i want you in no doubt on that we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue and were very focused on it because weve come out of that fullyear of transformation phase with a very strong focus on growth we continue to target a midteens rote in and i just want to say thank you for joining us and neil and the team are available should you need them hope to see many of you here in hong kong in april when we hold our inaugural global
