the conference over to your speaker ewen stevenson please go ahead ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning or good afternoon all this is ewen here the groups cfo im joined today by iain mackinnon our group treasurer who is actually joining by phone from a different location and greg case our head of fixed income investor relations theres a fixed income specific slide deck available on our website but we dont plan to speak to specific slides as part of these introductory comments well keep the comments brief and i know youd all have had a chance or will have the chance to listen to the equity call that noel quinn and i did earlier today i will try to quickly run through what we announced today and then hand over to iain mackinnon for more detail on capital and funding before opening up for any questions you have firstly a few words on the current environment yeah we clearly continue to be in a very unpredictable environment but i think weve responded well and we continue to do what we can to support the customers and colleagues through what is an exceptionally difficult period i think in that context we are satisfied with how our business is performing asia has held up well for us and within global banking and markets the fixed income business delivered a very strong revenue growth in the second quarter hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 businesses that performed less well are largely in areas that weve already committed to change where well be accelerating our transformation in the second half the bank remains strong and resilient with excellent funding and liquidity positions and our core tier improved to in the quarter turning to the second quarter results themselves given the impact of covid19 the second quarter was tough financially we had an fall and reported profit before tax and a drop in adjusted profit before tax our results were heavily impacted by lower revenues which came from a combination of subdued customer activity in many parts of our business and the building effect of ultralow interest rates it was the second quarter in a row of very high expected credit losses and we also had a billion software intangible writeoff largely as a result of the weak return outlook for the nonringfenced bank on revenues adjusted revenues were down which included a million benefit from volatile items which in part reversed some of the negative impacts we saw from marktomarket movements in the first quarter expected credit losses were up on the first quarter million in total or basis points of gross loans with the largest impact seen in the uk geographically and in commercial banking amongst our three global businesses uk expected credit losses were million higher than the first quarter reflecting the worsening economic outlook for the uk of which million related to our uk ringfenced bank stage expected credit losses were broadly stable at around billion in both the first and second quarters although the first quarter included significant charge on a single corporate exposure in singapore recognizing the deterioration that we saw in the economic outlook in the second quarter weve updated our range for the fullyear group expected credit losses to billion to billion the lower end reflects the path closest to our consensus central economic scenario reflecting a strong economic rebound in with some unwinding of the economic adjustments taken todate the higher end of the range reflects the path closer to our downside economic scenario with a much more muted economic recovery in leading to further negative ecl adjustments for forward economic guidance in the second half id caution that there remains a wide range of potential outcomes including the risks that the upper end of this range may need to increase further and in that respect id encourage you to read ecl sensitivities in the interim report as we look out to the second half there remains considerable uncertainty whether that be from the continuing impact of covid19 the ongoing brexit negotiations or the uschina tensions and the impact that has on our hong kong franchise as such its too early to discuss distribution policy or mediumterm return targets and we dont expect to do so until our fullyear results in february however were pleased that we phased into this uncertainty with a strengthened core tier ratio with an extra billion in customer deposits through the second quarter continued vigor in managing our cost base down down q2onq2 and the benefit of a diversified portfolio of franchises globally noel and i remain very committed to the plan we announced in february namely a mature reduction in rwas particularly focused on the us the nonringfenced bank and global banking and markets with a reallocation of these rwas towards our strongly performing asian franchise secondly a significant reduction in the operating cost base of the bank and thirdly a mature reduction in the ongoing operating complexity of the bank with that ill pass it over to iain to run through the balance sheet hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 iain mackinnon group treasurer hsbc holdings plc thank you and hi everyone iain here thanks for dialing in despite the weak macro environment the balance sheet metrics continued to remain very strong and improve our cet1 ratio was up basis points to in the quarter and our fully loaded cet1 ratio was customer deposits grew by billion resulting in a loanto deposit ratio of thats down percentage points since the start of the year the group remains very liquid with those highquality liquid assets of over billion on hand thats up billion from the end of last year our consolidated liquidity coverage ratio on the european delegated act basis was thats purely flat in the half with regard to the issuance plan youll have noted our gross and net issuance is significantly down in versus prior years we did expect this we did say we would remain flat we did successfully tender for billion of bullet securities while issuing billion of new or 10year callable paper managing their next year c financing needs this year we continue to expect to keep our net issuance around zero in mrel senior our tier remains zero our tier need will remain zero we dont expect to grow the balance over at1s with that ill hand back to ewen ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks iain sharon if we can now open up the lines for any questions please question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of daniel david autonomous dan david q analyst autonomous research llp hi there thanks for taking my thanks for the call and thanks for taking my questions i have two just looking at your issuance plans as you said it looks like mostly refi in holdco senior and at1 looking ahead at your maturity profile you obviously got indiscernible maturing in on holdco senior would you look to prefinance any of that billion thats rolling off alongside with billion in and on at1 can we assume that youll run at the level of at1 youve got now and also are there any changes to tier1 type of leverage that we should think about when considering your at1 plans second question is just on libor transition can you give us a bit of an update on how youre progressing are there any products that you think might be the kind of transition effort and also how are you thinking about the discos in the context of libor transition thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc iain do you want to start with that weve got greg here too who can pick up hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc yeah on the refinancing yes we are looking ahead and we will take the temperature on that as we go through the end of this year and early next year and probably look to do some refinancing a bit like weve done now but it very much depends on market conditions and appetite with regard to the at1 i think were not expecting to extend it with regards to extent the base of our at1 with regard to the double leverage with the fallback in on the cessation of the dividend double leverage is running at or about risk appetite so were actually seeing nothing untoward that and then on the final point maybe hand over to maybe hand over to greg but i dont feel i can really comment on the discos at the moment greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure thanks iain its greg here so as a general point on libor i think were aligned with the industry on this i think were very keen to move toward the new standards and weve been doing that with our most recent issuance and were looking at what opportunities well have to make sure that were as compliant as we can be and want to be working with the investment community to ensure that were getting the right outcomes in time but obviously still got plenty of time to work that through specifically on the discos were not going to talk to individual bonds we dont want to give any kind of legal analysis but our main intention where we can is to try and remediate bonds and move over to new reference rates where we can dan david q analyst autonomous research llp okay great thanks a lot operator thank you your next question comes from the line of paul fenner société générale please go ahead paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk hi can you hear me ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk oh hi and thanks for taking my question i got two quick ones first i didnt quite just to be completely clear are you still aiming to issue at1 this year to cover what you redeemed earlier or is that now off the table for the remainder of thats question number one and the question number two and im sorry if i missed it on the main call this morning what i think is apparent is the transformation program is fixing things that investors are have become more or less comfortable with at hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 least in terms of the uncertainty and the what people are worried about are the businesses that have typically gone okay in asia and so i certainly put the ph recent hsbc underperformance in bond land i can only think that thats because people are worried about whats going on in china ph hong kong what is it that you can tell us about indiscernible iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc maybe i can answer the ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sorry i think we missed the last of the question at the end there paul paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk sorry sorry yeah hello ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah so we just missed up the question at the very end there paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk oh yeah so my question with investors thats what theyre kind of worried about and im never quite sure what it is that i can tell them i know its not in your youre not political analysts youre not economists but you can tell us something about where you think foreign policy in the us in the uk in the european union visàvis china hong kong where that could impact your business most readily and so we can kind of just to start to factor in some potential downside risks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah look i dont think were going to sit on call and probably speculate about the foreign policy position of various governments around the world i mean all i can point to as i said earlier on the call was if you look at the underlying financial performance of whether it was hong kong business which was continuing to ph attract deposit flow in  the china business which profits were up materially in  its very hard to point to anything thats having any material impact on our business at the moment as a result of geopolitical tension so but were not speculate on the position of various government foreign policy around the world on the first one on at1 issuance iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc yeah so paul no plans to refinance that call that we made in january and were happy with where the tier capital moved to after that so as we look out over the course of the next kind of months weve got our next new style at1 call is not until next summer so well have to look at that as and when clearly weve got the legacy tier capital credit starting to roll off and obviously well think about how we look at that in the future and hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 whether or not we refinance that but if we were to issue any at1 it would be to refinance rather than anything else paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk im sorry ph and not going to happen this year iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc i think we wouldnt rule it out but at this stage theres nothing immediately planned paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of robert smalley ubs please go ahead robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for doing the call just a couple of quick questions as youve covered a lot already this morning and in the earlier call just in general loan loss provisioning a number of your peers have said that they feel that theyre around peak provisioning youre seem to be indicating that youre going to have similar levels at least in the third quarter could you talk about just give us an idea around that and where you think thats going to come from secondly on liquidity could you give us if possible a breakdown on because im looking at slide youve got it by division could you give us a breakdown geographically how much of that liquidity is in the uk for example and how much do you need to there around changing economic circumstances in brexit and then third i just want to be clear on issuance on page as a gross number roughly how much holdco senior are you looking to issue in for the remainder of thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah its not what we said in relation to ecls the we indicated in the firsthalf of the year we had just under billion of ecls and for the secondhalf of the year weve indicated a range of billion to billion for the fullyear which mathematically implies somewhere between billion and billion for the secondhalf so i dont think were indicating that we continue to naturally expect the third quarter to see the same run rate that we saw in the first two quarters robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc the i think the key determinant will be yeah as we go into third quarter will be is there any material shift in forward economic guidance so and i think unlike some of our peers and i know a couple of uk peers last hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 week talked about much lower sensitivity but they would ph caveat that theres no change and forward economic guidance thats not what weve said weve acknowledged the fact that there could be changes in the forward economic guidance and hence why we have come out with a broader range iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc rob so on the lcr and weve given that the ratios on the slide theres more detail in the interim report so you can see the hqla by entity on page of the interim report we put out this morning that should give you more insight on the issuance plan in terms of gross holdco senior well i think when we set out the plan at the start of the year we obviously had in mind that we were looking to do the liability management that we undertook and thats why we were very clear with our guidance that it was a refinancing and so if you look out at what weve got to deal with that for the rest of the year weve got about billion billion of holdco senior that matures this year or is callable this year sorry and subject to those calls being made then well probably look at refinancing them but its thats not even necessarily going to be of the case either robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thanks thats very helpful appreciate the call operator thank you your next question comes from the line of indiscernible rbc please go ahead q hi there thanks for taking the call just one from me please more on the payment holiday and the indiscernible when you think of the stock of loans which made to stage i understand that these do not include the longterm payment holiday when you think of these both of these categories stage and payment holidays which one do you think is riskier can you give us some sort of idea about what are your thoughts behind the risk indiscernible where do you expect more losses to materialize over the next i dont know months and anything would be helpful ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah i guess within the indiscernible all of that i mean youre clearly having to make significant assumptions in terms of likely impairments against those payment holidays when they roll off i guess well learn a lot more in the next one to three quarters as they do but we have built in assumptions into that range of billion to billion that we came out with for example in the uk theres very big judgment calls for example on where indiscernible unemployment go post of the end of the furlough scheme which then rolls through to whether that would stretch or what degree of stretch that puts on payment holidays but we set out on page of interim report yeah some fairly detailed analysis of what relief weve given and where and you can make your own assumptions on that as in terms of the ph type of loss ratio wed factor in both we have made our adjustments and coming out with the billion to billion range q hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions your next question comes from the line of lee street citigroup please go ahead lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd hello good afternoon all thanks for taking my questions ive got a couple of questions on stage and then one on ratings just on stage there seems to be quite a significant increase in the stage balances which mostly coming from corporate and commercial lending so im just trying to understand whats driving this is this fundamental in terms of a real greater risk or this hsbc being a bit more conservative in the way theyre doing ifrs and so moving things from stage to stage because were not necessarily seeing a uniform movement across all banks thats number one and number two linked to that and a little bit like the last question obviously theres quite big discrepancy at the moment between stage balances and stage balances that are actually past due which im guessing obviously coming from the payment moratoria so how would you recommend that we go about looking at an understanding what proportion of stage balances are likely going to actually move into stage because obviously thats the key question and just finally on moodys im presuming you have a regular interaction with them any thoughts or comments on the risk ph youll obtain from moodys downgrade for you basically thatd be my three questions thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc well on the last one i dont think were going to speculate what moodys may or may not do and its probably a question thats better directed at them on stage i mean its mainly the deterioration in forward economic items that weve seen if you go from end of april when we announced  results and run through weekonweek through to about midjuly what we saw is a steady deterioration in the economic outlook for the global economy and more pronounced in some places such as the uk almost week on week and ph it only grew began to stabilize in july ie that the trough of what people thought for we did see some uplift on economic recovery in but not enough to offset the sharpness of the v or the recessionary event is yeah i mean you obviously have to run your own indiscernible its a very complicated set of judgements that you need to make in this environment given the models havent seen any events like those so yeah the models are probably less predictive and reliable particularly when you get to more extreme ends of downside scenarios we have had effects in underlays as a result of which set out the youre trying to factor in the impact of government support packages and when those government support packages rolloff what is going to be the impact on credit and yes so all of that thinking has been factored into the best extent we can and coming up with the billion to billion range and we tried to give you as much details as we can to allow you to take different assumptions and applying different probabilities to our various scenarios as set out in our interim report lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 03aug2020 okay and just a quick followup sir just in terms of your stage because i guess stage can importantly incredibly highquality credits weve seen a slight deterioration in probability ph fell as well as near term from much riskier is there any commentary you can give around sort of is that the case is it high quality stuff thats flowing up the balances in stage or is it just a mix ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc lee well so the pillar doc is coming out in a week or two and youll be able to see how the crr or thats the credit ratings that we use internally have migrated so thats going to be a reasonable idea from that point lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd all right perfect all right thanks all for your comments ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks lee operator thank you there are currently no further questions ill hand back to you sir ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thanks a lot sharon and thanks a lot
