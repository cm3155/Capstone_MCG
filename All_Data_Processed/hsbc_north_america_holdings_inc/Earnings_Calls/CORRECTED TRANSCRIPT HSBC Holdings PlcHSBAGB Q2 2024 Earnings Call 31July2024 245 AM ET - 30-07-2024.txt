management discussion section operator welcome ladies and gentlemen to the analyst and investor webinar on the interim results for hsbc holdings plc for your information this webinar is being recorded we are now ready to start the webinar so i will hand over to noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning to everyone in london and good afternoon to those joining from hong kong today is my last results announcement before george takes over in september im delighted to be handing the stewardship of the bank over to him george is an exceptional leader wholl understand what makes hsbc special id like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything theyve done over the last five years and i wish george every success for the future i have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the strategic role it plays in the world but when i took this job on five years ago we didnt have the financial performance to match our standing my aim was to change that i believe weve done so and created a strong platform for future growth this was evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first half performance this year revenue hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 of billion was up profit before tax of billion was stable on the same period last year this performance enabled continued strong capital generation our return on tangible equity was excluding notable items weve announced billion of further capital distributions today this takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of the last months to billion finally weve updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future were providing new guidance of a midteens return on tangible equity in in addition to the guidance we already had were upgrading our banking nii guidance from an at least billion to around billion were revising our ecl guidance to be back within our normal mediumterm planning range of to basis points and were reconfirming our cost guidance of around growth on a target basis thats despite growth of in the first half which as george will explain is mainly due to timing differences compared to last year the benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evidenced in our performance before getting into detail on the further progress made over the last six months please allow me to share some reflections on our fiveyear journey when we set out there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns the first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio building on the work of my predecessors who initiated important structural changes weve continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were nonstrategic subscale and unprofitable first via organic portfolio reductions which delivered rwa savings of around billion and then via inorganic means through disposals the second and very important strategy which we commenced at the same time was to build alternative sources of revenue growth within this weve invested to grow fee income particularly in areas where we have significant strengths such as wholesale transaction banking and wealth weve also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions and weve significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates from approximately billion of banking nii for a basis points downshock in interest rates at 30th of june to around billion at the end of and now down to around billion today all of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline which we have instilled across the group these savings enabled us to invest in the areas ive spoken about and this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance as you know we delivered a record profit in and a midteens return on tangible equity in and in the first half of it has been over years since the group was generating returns at current levels and we now expect to sustain it this year and in the other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders im really pleased that weve delivered around billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years including the distributions announced today and im especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of per share earlier this year following the sale of hsbc canada i see this payment not just as a financial return but as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years let me now summarize the further progress evidenced in the first half first wealth has been a key component of revenue diversification strategy it delivered two very good quarters growing revenue by in total in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 transaction banking fee and other income in global payment solutions grew by and in global trade solutions by in a very difficult environment for trade revenue for hsbc innovation banking was up quarteronquarter as our new global proposition continues to gain traction second our scale markets in hong kong and the uk enabled us to grow profits each year as we captured new opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses as you can see we also have positive growth in other markets including india which was up in the first half and singapore which was up third we continue to grow multijurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail fourth we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter despite what is still a relatively sluggish environment finally weve continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate movements george has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section all of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a midteens return on tangible equity this year and in as well let me get into some more detail the steps weve taken to change our retail business model and our continued investment in people and digitization have made wealth a key driver of revenue growth wealth revenue was up in the first half to billion and that growth is broad based as you can see in the boxes on the right side of the slide wealth fee and other income was up private banking revenue was up we attracted billion of net new invested assets and new business insurance csm was up moving to the next topic transaction banking revenue was stable in the first half there was good growth in payments which was up this included growth in fee and other income of this is a result of the investment weve made to grow and digitize that business which helped to improve our ranking from a top bank in to number today foreign exchange was down compared to a strong performance last year when there was very high volatility and while trade was slightly down in the half the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the second quarter but we still grew our trade volumes despite global trade volumes remaining subdued and we also increased our market share in trade in hong kong to more than on the next topic our businesses in hong kong and the uk both continued to perform well in the first half profit before tax in hong kong was up on a constant currency basis while the hong kong corporate loan market remained subdued it was resilient in the second quarter its too early to call it a trend but deposits and investment activity increased which underlines that the rate differential works in both directions we attracted newtobank customers in the half as we continue to capitalize on significant inflows into hong kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment profit before tax in the uk business grew by excluding the gain on svb uk last year customer lending was also up but our uk business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group in the first half we grew the number of uk international customers by to million customers hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 we have a strong international franchise we evidenced this through our multijurisdictional revenue disclosures in february and in the first half we grew wholesale multijurisdictional client revenue by to billion and as i said earlier this isnt just a wholesale story were doing more with our international retail and wealth customers as well we now have million international wealth and personal banking customers with revenue from these customers up to billion so these are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a midteens return on tangible equity this year and why we expect to deliver a midteens return on tangible equity in with that ill hand over to george thank you georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel and hello everyone before i get to the  numbers id like to comment briefly on the recent announcement im deeply honored by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into the future many of you may have questions about the future strategy and direction of the group although i dont take over as group chief executive until the 2nd of september from noel im ready to share a few highlevel thoughts under noels leadership we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth the strategy of the group is working and im committed to building on this the shape of the group is broadly where we want it to be with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities thats hong kong the uk our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities and our wealth proposition particularly in asia this puts us in a very strong position in each of these activities we have scale and sustainable competitive advantages and our strength are aligned to the needs of our customers they account for the vast majority of the economic profit we generate today and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next to years and together they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle weve made good progress and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus and intensity to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory to improve operating leverage while maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management and to continue to improve client service and experience youll also have seen that we have announced this morning that jon bingham has been appointed interim group cfo from the 2nd of september jon is currently our financial controller and has outstanding technical accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise a process to identify the next permanent group cfo is underway and i will update you further in due course now though turning to  in summary profit before tax of billion was up billion on the second quarter of on a constant currency basis in terms of the drivers the banking nii run rate was stable on the first quarter there was another strong wealth performance while wholesale transaction banking was stable on last years second quarter despite cost growth of in the first half on a target basis we remain on track to meet our guidance of around cost growth and there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter on the next slide so hsbc canada contributed around billion of revenue and around billion of profit before tax in the quarter before the sale completed in march to make likeforlike comparisons easier these hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary so excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions profit before tax was up to billion revenue of billion was up billion on the second quarter of last year excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions revenue was up billion or on the second quarter of last year banking nii of billion was down billion on the first quarter on a reported fx basis primarily because of a billion reduction from the canada sale excluding this the banking nii run rate was stable were now in a position to upgrade our banking nii guidance to around billion this assumes a billion contribution from argentina which was its reported nii in although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict were also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge around billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of with an average yield of and around billion of assets will mature in with an average yield of as well turning to fee and other income wholesale transaction banking was stable on the second quarter of last year or up excluding the impact of strategic transactions within this global payment solutions had another good quarter up as did securities services which was up foreign exchange delivered broadly stable revenue compared to a strong quarter last year and wealth had another very good quarter underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results wealth fee and other income was up by compared to last years second quarter private banking was a standout performer mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in asia but growth in wealth remained broad based customer growth and improved wealth penetration primarily in asia helped drive growth in investment distribution invested assets were up to trillion including billion of net new invested assets in the quarter and our insurance new business csm was billion up billion on the second quarter of last year on credit expected credit losses were billion in the quarter equivalent to basis points of average loans this included billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide excluding these ecls were broadly in line with our normal mediumterm planning range of to basis points stage balances were of customer loans up billion compared to the first quarter this was driven by hong kong commercial real estate book but there was a limited impact on ecl charge because of the high level of collateralization we are revising our ecl guidance to our normal mediumterm planning range of to basis points of average loans next costs grew by in the first half on a target basis but we remain on track to meet our guidance of cost growth of around percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance related pay accrual and levies as we explained at the first quarter we have phased the accrual of our performancerelated pay more evenly this year than last year we do not expect the total amount of performancerelated pay for to be materially different to so the accrual in the second half is expected to be lower yearonyear in addition the second half of last year included billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year we are therefore reconfirming our guidance of around cost growth for on a target basis and we remain committed to cost discipline hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 on lending and deposits there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the uk and asia whilst hong kong was broadly stable overall there were promising signs in the first half deposits were up with the majority of this in hong kong there was also growth in the uk europe and the us and the rest of asia but it also included the benefits of seasonality in commercial banking and a large oneoff in global banking and markets so i would encourage you not to annualize the figure next our cet1 ratio was down basis points on the first quarter as strong organic capital generation was offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks we have announced a new share buyback of up to billion which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around percentage points on our cet1 ratio in the third quarter finally to recap our strong first half performance and our confidence about the banks position enable us to provide new guidance of a midteens return on tangible equity excluding notable items for in addition to our existing midteens guidance for upgrade our banking nii guidance from at least billion to around billion revise our ecl guidance to within our normal mediumterm planning range of to basis points and reconfirm our guidance for cost growth of around on a target basis and a midsingle digit loan growth over the medium term with that louise can we please go to qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you george operator instructions our first question today comes from andrew coombs at citigroup please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi andrew andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning thank you both for the comments a couple of questions from my side one big picture one into the numbers and firstly big picture question noel you highlighted all the things you can be proud of during your tenure but perhaps with the benefit of hindsight be interested in any thoughts you have on anything you might have done differently and then linked to that as well george i think you were on the tape this morning talking about accelerating the existing execution so any tangible examples you can provide on that would be helpful as well and then in terms of the numbers question thank you for the additional disclosure around the structural hedge i think you talked about billion maturing in the second half at yield is it fair to assume the new positions that youre putting on are probably about a percent higher than that given where the forward curve is so prior to any offset from adding to the existing structural hedge notional its about billion of nii uplift is that fair noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 andrew thanks for your questions ill take the first one listen ive got no regrets andrew i think to perform in this role is an absolute privilege and look you never finish with an institution like this and thats why george is right to comment that you always want to do more theres always things you want to improve theres always investment you can do to grow more revenue to improve customer experience improve systems and processes so theres never a notion of finishing there should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition and i think thats probably the bridge from me to george because i have no regrets about the last five years i think weve done a lot of good things and i thank my colleagues for everything theyve done but equally you should never be complacent and think the job is finished the job of running an organization as large as ours and with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished and thats the bridge over to george now to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy so george hand to you on both of the next two questions please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel yes andrew ph and he was just echoing noel and building on that weve called out some of the key areas of our strategy ive called out hong kong the uk the international wholesale bank which is underpinned by a leading transaction banking capabilities as well as wealth all of which have demonstrated very strong momentum certainly over the last few years but definitely over the first half of this year were confident about the momentum were confident in our ability to continue investing in them and were confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth so its just about getting continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results on your question about the structural hedge andrew so billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of if i try to reverseengineer your math and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around with a uplift then you get billion but remember this is maturities that are happening over the course of the half therefore i think you have to average the number and therefore you have to assume half the number as an inyear benefit from that structural hedge reinvestment so say the half of your billion you quoted also bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge subject to market conditions weve done about billion in the first half its a good estimate of the run rate for the second half and that is a mild headwind because were increasing the hedge from higher shortterm rates into lower longerterm rates due to the inversion of the curve so you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for banking nii operator thank you george our next question today comes from amit goel at mediobanca please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc amit hi amit goel q analyst mediobanca hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 hey thank you for taking my questions so i have three firstly i was a bit surprised to get the profitability target which does seem to be a little bit above consensus i think consensus is about so i guess a bit of variation on midteens but if thats kind of just curious where you see a bit more upside is that mainly on the revs or can you see a bit more cost control and then just linked to that georges i think in your comments as well you talked about growing revenues on a sustainable basis so just curious again how youre thinking about that potentially with some nii headwinds and then lastly noel i think you used the term sluggish or subdued a few times when talking about the environment just curious when you think that will potentially turn and we can see a more constructive environment for some of those markets thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc sounds good amit ill ask george to answer the first one i think hes probably best and on the midteens and the definition of midteens and then also maybe sustainable revenue and then ill cover the third georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc very good thank you amit so consensus if you adjust consensus for for the impact of the loss from the sale of argentina which by the way as we communicated now we expect by the end of the year therefore its more reasonable to assume that that loss the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of billion which has no impact on capital or on distribution its fair to assume that impact will happen in but if you adjust the consensus in you get to around indeed our definition of midteens is broadly around to so without commenting on the consensus our midteens definition is broadly that to range on the growing revenue on a sustainable basis let me point you to three major indicators which are going to be important in the way we look at the future the first one related to banking nii banking nii number one has been stabilized partly with the reduction of banking nii sensitivity if you recall two years ago we called out billion to be the impact on banking nii on our revenue for a basis point drop in interest rates that number at the yearend was billion and that number as we reported it now is billion so therefore we have through activities of structural hedging but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking nii to the impact of lower rates the second component again relating to banking nii is that while for a few quarters weve seen subdued loan growth in particular in the uk and hong kong wholesale market we have now seen stabilization its early to call it a trend but we are encouraged by the stabilization weve observed and importantly we will be more encouraged to when we see rates coming off and the support they can have for loan growth in particular in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish other parts of our activity remained resilient loan growth in south and southeast asia remained very strong loan growth in the mortgage businesses in the uk and hong kong remained very strong so there is a volume component to banking nii which we supported and as you can see from our capital we have ample capacity to support loan growth hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 and the third component i will call out is the nonbanking nii part of our earnings fees and other income in particular wholesale transaction banking and wealth youve seen the momentum in these businesses youve seen the continued investment weve put in these businesses we believe these momentums are sustainable theres an underlying sustainable trend supporting wealth in particular in asia and there is an additional support through our own investments both technology and people relationship management related to support growth in this area and we believe the momentum is sustainable so those are the big broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and amit just to come a little bit more elaboration on the sluggish subdued listen im not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment i think its right for that to be the case because in the higher interest rate environment theres not many corporates out there who want to borrow at todays interest rates and actually theyve still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet they dont need to borrow which is a good position to be here but as you see interest rates come down i would expect there to be a pickup in activity and i suppose what george just said is were starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge its very early its too early to call it a trend but i was pleased in hong kong the rate of decline in the corporate lending book in hong kong in  reduced dramatically so wed been declining through and it actually plateaued in the  and it was and thats in hong kong and then in the rest of asia we saw a growth in  and  and in the rest of the world we saw growth in  and  so  was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending  we saw net growth as well so i think its encouraging early signs as interest rates come off i see that happening and the other thing is youve also got to remember theres another side to the hong kong market the deposit market in the investment market is very strong as you saw in our wealth businesses now the net new invested assets going in to the business so i think in the first half of this year was about billion if i remember correctly and i think as rates come off cash moves into invested assets and i think were seeing were a beneficiary of that particularly in hong kong where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market whereas theyre subduing the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the hong kong market but the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments okay next question amit goel q analyst mediobanca thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks amit operator thank you very much noel our next question today comes from joseph dickerson at jefferies please accept the prompt to unmute your line hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc joseph thank you joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi thank you for taking my question just a couple of quick things so on the rote guidance if you look in the first half of the year youve kind of done an underlying number of and that was with some youve had a few credit headwinds but generally benign i mean i guess if you think about things like cash moving into invested assets which should be higher roe your wealth and personal banking roe is around at the moment youre doing about a uk roe i guess what would hold you back from maintaining that level in and notwithstanding some rate cuts it seems like theres a lot more flex in the ph models and your business model and i know you need to be conservative but i guess is it rates that would hold you back lack of activity and i guess that the followon question yeah noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc joseph yeah i think its a fair observation but i think and were not being conservative for the sake of being conservative i think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial proportions i think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets i think were just its still a bit early in the cycle theres a lot of uncertainty still out there and i think given our guidance of midteens which is somewhere between the and range is fair at this point in time i think the most important thing weve tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and let each quarter be the base for the future so i think its better to set reasonable and sensible guidance and then we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter by quarter go so i dont think were in the mold as an institution of being overly bullish one way or the other particularly when theres still quite a bit of uncertainty out there but george is there anything you want to add georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah no nothing noel you covered it i mean just one parameter also just to add is just remember to remove the impact of argentina with the expected sale taking place at the end of this year in your assessments operator thank you our next question today comes from raul sinha at jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi good morning hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc raul good morning raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you for taking my questions i was just trying to dig into some of your commentary around the hedge i was wondering ive got two questions the first one is just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is changing in the uk versus the rest of the world my understanding was that the structural hedging in the uk was quite a mature book so i wouldnt have expected that to increase in size going forward and i would think that most of the lowyielding refinancings are coming from the uk whereas when we think about the rest of the world it looks like your structural hedging was more recent so theres probably scope to increase that but maybe the refinancing yield is a bit higher is that the kind of right understanding is the first question the second question is just coming to the hong kong cre book and some of the disclosure ph weve pulled out there i think billion of total exposure of that is unsecured i was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more additional color around the unsecured part of hong kong cre i think you say its very good quality but how you look to manage the risks given the unsecured nature of this cre book thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you george do you want to pick up both of those georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure noel so raul on the hedge size we havent given the specific currency split or balance sheet split but yes you should assume the sterling component is one of the largest component in terms of the hedge size and the uk therefore the sterling component is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge but there is obviously still or previous hedges maturing previous hedges struck at lower yields maturing and were able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yield that was still a component in the uk banks nim which has been broadly stable and we expect to remain broadly stable and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that with regards to the rest of the world its a story of two tales indeed there is the reinvestment of all structural hedges at higher yields and that is a tailwind in our banking nii there is also additional hedges were doing where we can and these additional hedges are suffering from ph a partial setoff or is partial offset to them as a headwind because theyre suffering from the fact that ph credits are unrated but its still the right thing to do for the management of our banking nii sensitivity and then obviously always keep in mind that the hong kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under hedged and thats due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough instruments to be able to invest in the long term to support hedging so the hong kong dollar would remain structurally underhedged in that sense hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 with regards to the hong kong cre question so of the book is of the billion you mentioned is unsecured it is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate of that book today is rated strong and good and literally is in the impaired category were very comfortable with the exposure we have in that book and we continue obviously supporting our customers through the cycle in this space operator thank you george we will take our next question today from jeremy hou at cicc please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc jeremy hi dekai hou q analyst china international capital corp ltd hi can you hear me noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah dekai hou q analyst china international capital corp ltd okay good morning noel good morning george my first question is on the noninterest income if my math is correct my calculation shows that our adjusted noninterest income is billion this quarter compared to billion a year ago and we had million growth on wealth transaction banking is relatively stable so since gbm contributed a lot this quarter so i understand that this business has seasonality and is volatile but do you expect that momentum to continue going forward or do you think in the second half of last year is relatively a weak comparison yeah the second question is a broader one because i realize now you speak less about focusing asia these days than you used to and emphasizing more on the global network yes sometimes in some ways they do intersect but im wondering do you still focus on exploring some bolton opportunities in asia and wealth business in the future and do you have a capital distribution hierarchy or preference among dividend buyback and growth yeah thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay george do you want to take the first one ill give a few comments on the second one and you take the third one on capital distribution georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc very good and thanks noel jeremy so without giving specific comments on the quarterbyquarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component the growth that youve observed yearonyear in  hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 were mainly driven from two areas the first one is wealth which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth the other one was from markets in particular from some of the equity business in markets this is coming on the basis of two components one a subdued  last year so there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for the  this year and then the second one is the fact that weve seen more activity and more vigorousness in if you want the asian stock markets in particular the hong kong stock market and were encouraged by this and if the trend continues this will bode well for additional activity in this space let me jump to the third question and ill hand over to noel to conclude on the second one capital distribution hierarchy first weve committed to dividend payout ratio for this year which means half our earnings will be earmarked for foreseeable dividend part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends the rest will be netted out at the end of the year after that we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business loan growth as we said earlier started to pick up in certain areas we are encouraged but we have ample capital to support the loan growth the appetite we have we look at bolton acquisitions or areas that are dead on strategy both supportive of acceleration of the strategy that will be part of utilization of excess capital and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks if you look at our cet1 ratio today at and you look at our capital accretion that we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance weve given for this year and next year were confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three and i will say the buybacks well continue looking at it on a quarterbyquarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks jeremy on your second question is it an asia strategy is it an international strategy i think theyre interchangeable i dont think theyre mutually exclusive because if you look at what we do at the core of what weve done for years or more is weve connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world thats what weve done from day one of hsbc being founded so were essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally invest internationally now why are they one and the same well a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in asia theyre based in the middle east theyre based in the east and they trade with the west and the west trades with the east and asia and the middle east are highgrowth markets so i dont think its an eitheror i think for us its very simple that is were internationally driven and asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward the nature of trade will change as it has done for years so i think we use the words asia and ph internationals and probably interchangeably and sometimes it gets people confused were investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation there is growth there is international connectivity there is differentiation in asia there is in the middle east and we have the same here in the uk or fundamentally at the core were an international bank operator thank you noel hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 dekai hou q analyst china international capital corp ltd thank you operator operator instructions our next question today comes from aman rakkar at barclays please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc aman hi aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning gents noel i just wanted to start off and congratulate you on your excellent tenure at hsbc noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd and just wanted to wish you the very best going forward whatever it is you decide to do and george on a similar theme just to extend my congratulations around your appointment as ceo i had two questions please both on net interest income so a point of clarification i guess your banking nii guide this year of circa billion at face value does imply a material stepoff in net interest income in h2 i just wanted to check i mean youre guiding for argentina being billion this year and i think it was the best part of million in h1 so is it literally just argentina dropping out of net interest income in h2 is driving that and what would really really help is the kind of momentum of nii in h2 and the extent to which that carries over into im not necessarily looking for an updated guide here but if i just take again your banking nii disclosure at face value its implying a kind of billion annualized run rate in h2 exargentina what do you think the puts and takes are on that if we were to kind of look a bit further afield beyond this year and then the second question was if i could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit passthroughs youre obviously noting youve hedged more of your balance sheet now and what if actually passthroughs were to be say lower than what youre modeling in your updated banking nii sensitivity that would be really helpful thank you very much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george do you want to take both hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks noel aman thank you so on your first question look around billion of banking nii for this year is a reasonable expectation and were more confident about it because were already seven month into the year and somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than weve experienced over the last few months argentina we have worked with a planning assumption of billion so within our around billion weve factored in around billion contribution from argentina it is a very difficult to predict number it is a very volatile number and therefore the best of estimate you can use around billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for argentina but were sticking with this billion estimate on the uncertainty just for reference billion was the banking nii contribution of argentina in and this is how were building the assumption for planning for this year now if you look forward for h2 headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking nii the first one to call out is the rates outlook were using the midjuly curves which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half this is the working assumption the second one is on the structural hedge so as we called out earlier you should expect to benefit from the billion maturing assets in at yields which would be reinvested at higher yields than at the prevailing yields in h2 which will be higher take a fiveyear rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be reinvested at but this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve again here your best guide is what weve done in h1 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for h2 but will depend on market conditions in h2 the other components that are playing as headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth we continue to see strong growth in south and southeast asia we continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the uk and hong kong but we are now encouraged to see stability in the hong kong wholesale book which has been on a decline for a few quarters its early to call it a trend but it is now it is definitely green shoots when we look forward and it will be supported with rate reductions as in the balance sheet growth in this space and then the last one to call out is deposit migration thats particularly true in hong kong again   weve seen migration at and respectively which is overall on the half just to put it in perspective this is after fullyear where weve seen so again the trend here is much more encouraging were very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year but it remains a difficult one to predict now as you look forward into the fullyear were not guiding on banking nii but a few points for you to bear in mind the first one is please remove argentinas contribution again working assumption billion this is following the planned sale of argentina to take place before the end of the year second remove the one quarter contribution from canada billion in your nii then weve shared that there will be billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in with an average yield of so those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield so beyond that you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking nii sensitivity we provided billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a basis point drop and you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption and again we believe lower rates will be more supportive of growth in balance hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 sheet when you look into but basically all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity for at midteens aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd so thank you very much for all that color it was excellent just around passthroughs i think georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so on deposit sure aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd earlier this year you talked about lower betas adding something like million georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay so the banking nii sensitivity to change in passthrough rates is around million this remains around million and this is based off an assumption of around billion of ipcas so we can work out the math if you want offline that number is broadly stable were still working on an assumption of a pass through in our banking nii sensitivity second if you look at the cumulative passthroughs were broadly around from the start of the rate hikes in late all the way to now broadly around the earlier part was much lower than the latter part was much higher than it is difficult to predict how passthroughs will work out on the rate cut scenario and this is why i think remains a good estimate of what it could look like noting that we dont have recent history of that i would point you to one thing to be mindful of is in the uk and a number of other geographies we will have to provide customer notice of at least days before we pass through rate cuts so there will be a delay in pass throughs on the way down and thats a to day on average for instance in the uk thank you aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much operator thank you george our next question today will come from ed firth at kbw please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi ed edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods yeah thanks gents and again good morning everybody yeah and just to echo amans comments and thank you particularly to you noel because its been a pretty turbulent period for hsbc and i think there were a hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 number of times when if somebody said youd be making midteens returns i think i would have thought that was delusional so thank you very much for that as thats noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you thank you edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods benefits us all my two questions were the first one was could you tell me you probably disclosed it somewhere and ive missed it but performancerelated pay i see youre assuming thats going to be flat this year is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is because i guess there must be some potential that that may have to go up particularly given the revenue performance so that would be my first question and then the second one was to me if i look at these results i guess the standout to me was the performance in  of the wealth and private banking business if i look in the past its generally been quite seasonal in  but it seems that actually its held up pretty flat so should we expect that is that like a sort of new base level of run rate is that something we should continue into the second half now and then sort of grow on from there or was there something about  which held it up better than we might have expected thank you very much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc well firstly thank you for your comments and on your second point on wealth listen ill give a very personal comment you normally expect  to be the seasonal high and then a bit lower in  and a bit lower so actually  did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality it was a strong quarter at the moment ph i cant we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say dont base a trend on a quarter or two but i think your assessment there actually  was a strong performance is exactly where we are it was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality i think it is if i talk to the team they were confident of a good performance theyre seeing good lead indicators i mean weve taken in in excess of billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a bit years years and i think weve all got to probably we havent seen this period where how will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off and therefore i think it is difficult to predict a trend i think we just got to see it go quarter by quarter but the lead indicators are good weve invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position it was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it we invested heavily in the product lineup for our clients to make sure that if they were going to move into invested assets they could do so with us rather than another bank and we invested in distribution we had good distribution in hong kong but we didnt have as good a distribution in other markets so we built our distribution in mainland china in singapore in india and in the rest of the world so i think its put us a good position to take advantage of it but its too early to call it a trend but your observation is a fair observation for  it was good and its nice to be able to report that on performance related pay and costs i mean ill let george cover that but were absolutely committed to the so hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so we paid billion through full year on performancerelated pay this is disclosed in our annual reports and accounts but if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in we actually under accrued in the first quarter and then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number when you look at full year we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full year than for the full year and any decision on the performancerelated pay will take place in january with the remuneration committee after the full years performance has been delivered but we are accruing broadly to the same number the difference is that were accruing more evenly so this is why youll see a higher accrual on a yearonyear basis in the first half and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory all of this is factored in our cost guidance of limiting cost growth to around were absolutely committed to our or circa cost growth guidance were confident we can deliver it and we are on track to deliver it operator thank you george our next question today comes from katherine lei at jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc katherine katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd hi good morning hi good morning thanks for answering my questions i have one question actually two both related to capital on the capital side we saw there is billion of addition to rwa may i know like what is that related to i think ph in the notes is that something related to modeling so i would like to know like what kind of assumption changes leads to this billion and is that oneoff or should we see it as ongoing i will say additions to the rwa so this is number one number two we noticed some deterioration on asset quality on hong kong cre book actually according to the disclosures the deterioration seems quite significant as well can you explain to us what is the impact on capital because we understand that there is limited impact on ecl charges but mainly reflected on capital so what is the drag on capital and then also like going forward whether its your view on hong kong cre in particular for the loans which are already in stage categories are you expecting that there will be recovery of loans through disposal of the collaterals or are you expecting the borrowers will eventually make up for the loans thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thanks katherine george do you want to pick up those points georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 sure sure noel thanks katherine so on the capital so weve indicated a billion increase in rwas due to modeling adjustment to be specific weve adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally and the reason we adjusted this probability for default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the observations and learnings from the march crisis in the way governments have supported a bank resolution thats specifically true for the us and switzerland weve taken those learnings weve baked them in our modeling and this resulted in this additional rwa insofar that bank models probability of default et cetera are concerned we consider this to be done and if you ask me well we continuously look at our models in a general fashion look the next big model update is going to be basel as and when basel becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate we have not indicated the impact which we do not expect to be material but were waiting to see some of the final rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market but we dont expect it to be material in terms of hong kong cre weve spoken earlier about the that is unsecured with which we remain very comfortable so your question probably relate to the other which is the secured portfolio of our billion exposure so of this about billion are credit impaired whats happening basically is a number of a few of our customers basically are facing some shortterm cash flow pressure challenges and this is partly due to high rates but the balance sheet remains strong and our level of collateralization remains strong typically for this impaired billion portfolio the level of collateralization on average is loan to value so that this is why there is a material if any ecl impact from the designation to now stage in terms of the capital impact some of depending on which models were using and what form of lending it is some of the impact may manifest in rwas and weve seen a little bit of that in last quarter some of it will manifest in eel excess expected loss which will go straight into our cet1 we publish these numbers but by and large these are immaterial numbers and again its all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level of collateralization against the exposure as we look forward first these customers the specifically credit impaired customers are current remain current we expect some of the pressure theyre facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in hong kong picks up in terms of medium to longterm outlook for the sector we are actually positive we are confident first in the hong kong economy in general to rebound but in particular for the sector we expect that this sectors pressure will ease in the medium to long term and we remain confident and positive about this sector operator thank you george we have time for one last question today and that comes from gurpreet singh sahi from goldman sachs please accept the prompt to unmute your line noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you can you guys hear me hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah yeah were good gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc okay good morning noel first of all and george congrats and noel congratulations for a new path wherever you choose to be noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge et cetera i have a question regarding two questions which are pretty much linked regarding falling rates and how does the management see it first of all the wealth income its an odd cycle with wealth income and aum growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high so when they do fall do we have any precedent as to whether they will be an impact on the wealth income from falling rates or we dont get that much benefit from income we see right now that a lot of mainland chinese money is also coming out and parking in hong kong so thats the first part of the question the second is lending growth we have targets for midsingle digit but when we think about modeling banking nii we have to look at average interestearning asset so im wondering we have lots of liquidity on the balance sheet if rates do fall and then some of these depositors dont feel incentivized do we get overall deposit growth not so strong which in turn leads to average interestearning assets not growing and hence we should not be modeling in average interestearning assets growth at midsingle digits or help us ph shrink out there thank you so much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay i think george will pick up both of those georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc very good thanks noel gurpreet so first wealth income the way we report it essentially is fees and other income so the slide i have there for wealth thats particularly the fees part which is fees earned on asset under management or on for insurance in particular related to new business csm so the impact if you want on rates is more about the transition of customers from deposits into aums so this has been happening we are seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring if you want to aums in our wealth proposition it is likely on a trend basis that when rates come down and deposit the earnings you can make on deposits reduce that customer may shift some of it into aums through will be visible in our net new invested asset proposition and then we will be able to service them in the fee space hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 so yes there is a component where we do expect more wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative but this is more on a broad trend basis not a direct linkage and we are also benefiting from the structural growth of wealth in particular in asia where we believe the underlying market is growing at very highsingle digit if not doubledigit percent over the next five years and on top of that underlying growth which were benefiting from we are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space so this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum on your second point its a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth but we have also strong dependence for our banking nii to deposit growth which constitute the underlying for our average interestearning assets so weve seen this quarter deposit growing i caution you not to annualize the because some of it is seasonal some of it is oneoff but we have a fantastic deposit franchise i mean you know us everywhere we operate we have a very strong balance sheet thats very appealing and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail which mean that we will continuously look to capture deposits we continue winning global payment solutions mandates in the wholesale space we continue being attractive for retail customers and we just shared noel shared new customers joining our hong kong business alone in the uk in we added million new customers so therefore we do continue seeing a good momentum underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc listen i think id reinforce that and add another comment the trick for us in the past we were very good as a retail bank we were very good as a corporate bank but when customers whether they were retail customers or corporate customers wanting to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasnt strong enough we deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for wealth so that cash if it did move it moved within the bank not outside the bank one of the byproduct benefits is if youve got a good wealth proposition you also attract the cash you keep cash in the bank as well they go hand in hand and so i think look i think were in a very different position today in offering wealth propositions to clients and what weve done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream so its less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking and there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity and thats i think the exciting trend for the future and i think thats where why we believe that were well positioned to deliver midteens rote next year because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering so i just want to say thats not a by chance strategy that was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank operator thank you that ends todays qa so i will now hand back to noel for closing remarks noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 well thank you louise and thank you everyone for joining us
