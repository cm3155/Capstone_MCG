morning in london good afternoon in hong kong thank you for joining our third quarter results call ewen is going to lead the financial presentation but i want to start by first talking about the leadership changes weve also announced weve now spent nearly three years transforming hsbc and while theres still work to do we are now in a much better place to accelerate our financial performance and deliver stronger returns as we approach the end of our threeyear transformation program myself and the board have taken the opportunity to review the composition of the gec with an eye to longterm succession planning as a result we have today announced that georges elhedery will take over as group chief financial officer on the 1st of january and greg guyett will take on the role of ceo of gbm

particularly good performances in the uk the middle east and southeast asia we delivered a doubledigit return on tangible equity for the ninemonth period excluding significant items and we remain on track to achieve our financial targets in and weve also kept a tight grip on costs and are driving greater efficiencies across the organization clearly this is important in an unpredictable and challenging external environment but its also a sign that our digitization strategy is working our work to structurally reposition the business and invest in areas of growth continues to gain traction we are in a much better position at the start of the new interest rate cycle as a result of the actions we have taken on capital efficiency portfolio rationalization organic revenue generation and cost control we can also see in wealth for example that were building a strong earnings platform for the future over the last months we attracted billion of net new invested assets with billion in the third quarter alone really i expect you to ask about ma activity when we get to the qa section of todays call as a result weve given some more information about our canada business in the appendix ill now hand over to ewen to take you through the details ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all as noel said these are a good set of results reported pretax profits in the quarter billion while down on last years third quarter this was due to the billion revenue impairment associated with the disposal of our french retail bank adjusted pretax profits in the quarter increased by billion or to billion reflecting a strong net interest income performance of billion thats up billion on last years third quarter we had higher ecls this quarter billion or basis points this primarily reflects increased economic uncertainty in the uk together with further provisioning for our china commercial real estate portfolio operating expenses are up yeartodate against the same period last year and up on last years third quarter due to higher technology investment and different timings for our variable pay accrual we remain on track to deliver broadly stable costs this year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 our core tier ratio was down basis points to including an around 30basispoint impact from the loss on the french retail bank disposal we continue to expect to be at the bottom end of our to target core tier range during the first half of at our second quarter results noel and i said our current strategy is the best and safest way to improve returns with strong revenue growth driven by rising rates and volumes and tight cost discipline with these results our strategy remains firmly on track good underlying growth across all of our businesses with operating costs remaining broadly stable yeartodate and an annualized reported return on tangible equity of adjusted revenue was up billion or as the positive impact of rate rises was reflected in our strong net interest income performance and noninterest income of billion was up million or on last years third quarter despite a million insurance market impact charge in the quarter ecls were billion net charge compared to a net release of million in last years third quarter we now expect an ecl charge of around basis points for this year lending was down on the second quarter and deposits down but excluding the impact of the reclassification of the french retail bank as held for sale lending and deposits were both up billion our tangible net asset value per share of was down on the second quarter due to negative fx and adverse fair value movements turning to slide were seeing good organic growth across all of our global businesses as well as the benefit of rising rates wealth and personal banking revenue was up with a good personal banking performance personal banking revenues were up billion on the third quarter last year due to higher rates and balance sheet growth there was a good underlying performance in wealth due to the strong insurance and private banking performance while revenue is down or million due to adverse market impacts in insurance of million we remain very confident in the growth of our wealth franchise we had billion of net new invested assets in the last months including almost billion in this quarter so our investment is building a strong future earnings platform commercial banking revenue was up with global payments solutions formerly known as glcm benefiting from higher rates together with continued strong underlying growth global banking and markets revenue was up market and securities services sic markets and securities services revenue was up due to market volatility and global payments solutions in global banking up partly offset by lower capital markets and advisory activity on slide net interest income was billion up billion versus last years third quarter this was primarily driven by higher rates and was strong across all regions and businesses on rates the net interest margin was basis points up basis points on the second quarter putting us back at prepandemic levels we now expect net interest income of around billion for this year and at least billion in compared to the previous billion guidance relative to the second quarter we are upgrading our assumptions on a likeforlike revenues by around billion on a constant currency basis including billion for fx movements and at least billion of planned higher cost of funding for the trading book with this benefit being reflected in higher trading income in noninterest income and as dollar for dollar with lower net interest income hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 in addition given the unprecedented speed of interest rate rises weve been seeing this year we believe were being cautious on our planning assumptions across deposit features deposit migration and asset margins from here the fx movements have a similar impact on costs with adjusted operating costs of billion translating to around billion using yeartodate average fx rates and around billion if you were to use september average rates given the slower growth we now foresee we now expect lowsingledigit lending growth in both and before returning to previous expectations of midsingledigit growth from onwards on the next slide noninterest income was billion up against last years third quarter net fee income was down the decline in fees was largely due to lower capital markets and advisory levels and global banking and markets and lower equity market activity in hong kong in wealth and personal banking indiscernible global payments solutions were up in commercial banking and up in global banking and markets other income was up including another strong fx performance in the quarter on the next slide weve reported a net charge of billion or of ecls in the quarter this included million of modeled stage and provisions and overlays million of stage loans and million of write offs there was a million charge in the uk including million of additional allowances for heightened economic uncertainty million also relates to the mainland china commercial real estate market around two thirds of which are stage and provisions and the remaining third are stage the overall quality of our loan book remains good stage loans as a percentage of total customer loans are stable at in terms of outlook we expect an ecl charge of around basis points for this year and for we now expect ecls to be at the higher end of our 30basispoint to 40basispoint planning range but with a higher degree of volatility around this guidance given the uncertain market outlook turning to slide weve had three quarters now of relatively stable costs yeartodate and we continue to expect costs to be broadly stable on last year within that third quarter adjusted operating costs were up on the same period last year driven by continued investment in technology and timing differences in the variable pay accrual versus the third quarter of we made a further million of cost program savings during the third quarter with costs to achieve spend of around million the formal threeyear program ends this year we now expect to spend between billion and billion slightly lower than our original billion cta target but the expected cost savings from the program remain unchanged at around billion by the end of this year rising to around billion of cost savings by the end of we continue to target around adjusted cost growth for with an ongoing focus on active cost management to mitigate inflationary pressures turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was down basis points on the second quarter this includes the sale of our french retail banking operations which had an impact of around basis points and further negative reserve movements through other comprehensive income due to higher rates reported riskweighted assets were down billion on the second quarter principally to fx movements and weve now achieved our yearend ambition of at least billion of cumulative rwa saves with modest further saves still expected in the fourth quarter hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 we expect core tier to now recover strongly in the fourth quarter back towards this reflects a number of factors including the formulaic impact of how our dividend is accrued during the year we accrue at the top end of our payout range so have already accrued yeartodate and additional capital management actions weve been taking to offset the negative oci movements please remember that this is not guidance of our fullyear dividend intentions the dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will true up at the full year based upon the results and outlook at the time we continue to expect to move back to the bottom end of our to target core tier range during the first half of and to consider buybacks from the second half of onwards so in summary these were a good set of results good earnings diversity across the group growth in all of our business lines and continued strong control on operating costs despite a weakening credit outlook our credit quality remains strong for were upgrading likeforlike revenue assumptions we continue to target around adjusted cost growth of around and we expect to be at the bottom end of our target core tier range in the first half of finally after another quarter of good progress we remain confident of delivering our targeted 12plus percent return on tangible equity in and beyond we expect a dividend payout ratio for both and supplemented by active capital management for surplus capital beyond this weve included a slide on canada in the appendix so you can see the shape of the business and the tangible equity within it weve also included slides on mainland china commercial real estate and the hong kong loan book with that elmer if we could please open up for questions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions our first question is from the line of mr omar keenan from credit suisse your line is now open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi omar omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd hi everybody good morning thank you very much for taking the questions and best of luck for the future ewen could i please ask a question on capital planning and on the provision scenarios so just on capital planning could you give an update on where hsbc is on the tactical rwa measures that are meant to get the core tier ratio up to above so itd just be good to have an idea of that and just given the focus on real estate prices in the uk and hong kong and mainland china would it be possible to give a sensitivity in terms of rwa migration to lower real estate prices in for example what a sort of to across the board reduction in real estate prices would mean for rwas and my other question on asset quality could you give a little bit more color on the guidance for full year i guess theres a lot of moving parts between stage and moving towards a downside or downside two scenario so when youre thinking about the fy guidance being at essentially basis points what sorts of assumptions are in there thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to pick up those points directly and omar thank you for your questions ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc look on capital planning i guess yeah various parts to that i mean firstly i touched on when i spoke about the technical nature of how we accrue dividends during the year so weve accrued so far this year so there will be very limited drag in  from dividend accrual secondly yeah weve largely completed the billion program that we committed to i think therell be a bit of a carry through into  of a few billion and on top of that going back to  we did implement a series of other sort of tactical measures to support the core tier given the movements we were seeing driven by the aci losses and the impact that was having on capital were already seeing some of that benefit come through the  results and therell be incremental benefits in  but i would say that we yeah you should see material improvement in the core tier ratio in the fourth quarter and then well be back at the bottom end of the core tier range by the middle of next year which also then supports the buyback comments for the second half of because at that point with a 12plus return on hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 tangible equity and a payout ratio and weve signaled that we expect lowsingledigit loan growth next year that means the business at that point is very capital accumulative on the second question on the real estate crisis look i dont have to hand what a impact would be on ratings migration across the book but yeah perhaps i can get you to follow up with the ir team afterwards there is quite a bit of detail in the pillar documents that i think they can help you sort of sift through to try and estimate what that impact may be and then on asset quality for well look firstly i think we do expect on the china commercial real estate book to continue to see some losses coming through that portfolio through it still feels like weve got some ways to go before were going to get to stability and improvement in the china property markets for the uk probably the market with the biggest delta around it for us at the moment is the uk yeah we have already in some ways frontend loaded potential stage losses for with forward economic guidance adjustments that weve made during the third quarter and above and beyond that look i think were just being reasonably prudent with the guidance at the moment we didnt say basis points we said to the higher end of basis points to basis points i think when we look at consensus its sitting at slightly higher than basis points at the moment but were not really trying to change that guidance but when you think about the world next year i think its also important to recognize that places like hong kong and china are likely to have better economic performances in than in so for us when you think about our business mix we have got a blend of some parts of the world seeing improved economic performance next year i dont know noel if you want to add any other comments on noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc id just reiterate the fact that despite the guidance to say at the top end of the basis points basis points were still committed to the delivering 12plus rote so its affordable within the rote guidance weve given you and we are building stage and stage provisions now in anticipation of potential losses turning into stage losses in so weve taken a prudent position on balance sheet positioning as well next question please omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you operator thank you our next question is from rob noble from deutsche bank your line is now open robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag uk morning i was wondering if we can just walk through the nii guidance so youre saying the billion has gone down billion for fx my understanding of the trading book funding cost because that was already within your previous nii sensitivity so rates have gone up and i would have assumed that your nii should have gone up by hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 more than what youre guiding to so the billion looks quite low to me so i was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts on that one please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah sure ill do my best look on the nii guidance and yeah theres a sort of the technical side to the guidance is on the walk from the second quarter yeah firstly as youve noted weve had adverse fx movements of billion and our planning assumption is that rate moves will increase the cost of funding in the trading book by at least billion yeah the cost of funding will be a drag on net interest income but well have a dollarfordollar improvement in trading income and noninterest income so relative to the second quarter we think were guiding likeforlike revenue guidance up by at least billion even though the net interest income guidance is down by billion look on the nontechnical side we think our net interest income assumptions at the moment are cautious yeah i think increasingly the interest rate sensitivity tables that we show you are less helpful because they are based on a deposit beta yeah given yeah the relatively unprecedented speed in rate rises that weve seen relative to recent history i think we are being deliberately cautious in key assumptions were assuming in that guidance very high deposit betas elevated levels of migration out of noninterestbearing current accounts and contraction of asset margins in some areas yeah well obviously see how this plays out in the coming quarters but i would say at the moment we are trying to be deliberately cautious in that guidance and i would note that likeforlike we have increased the guidance by around billion noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and just for clarity the cost of funding the trading book was inherent in the  numbers but that cost has increased by billion so its an increase on the  and its an offset between nii and nonnii so a lot of the cost on nii is higher by billion the benefit reemerges in the nonnii that billion reemerges ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay and the other thing is just also to note which was in my comments but if people missed it was that fx impact will also have a corresponding impact on operating expenses the costs were billion that translates to billion on average fx rate yeartodate and billion if we were to use september averages so i do think where consensus is sitting at the moment looks too high relative to those numbers robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag uk thank you just to follow up on the nii bit so the trading book funding costs go up but youve effectively assumed that the banking book doesnt benefit at all from incremental rate rises that youve assumed in  is that right ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah implicitly in those assumptions i think thats broadly correct but as i say i think within our planning assumptions at the moment yeah very cautious assumptions across deposit betas deposit migration and asset hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 margins and i think again that answer is more nuanced if you go to the individual legal entity level i think probably in hong kong we are getting towards peak nim during the fourth quarter i think in some of the other markets i still think theres further expansion of nim robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag uk all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question is from joseph dickerson from jefferies your line is now open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd good morning ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi joe joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thank you for taking my questions ewen you cited a weakening credit outlook could you just discuss for us help us dimension a little bit a couple of things in terms of for instance how a strengthening dollar plays on credit cost in your asia footprint and then relatedly if i look at the hong kong interbank liquidity is down to about hkd billion and the hkma has been active in defending the peg its not a zero chance that the peg could break and i guess what would be the consequences for the bank in that event particularly from a credit standpoint if you could help us think through those two dimensions that would be helpful many thanks noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think let me take the second question first if i can and then ewen you take the first we do not believe there is any risk to the peg at all we believe the peg the hkma have sufficient capabilities to defend the peg and thats not a scenario that we envisage ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah no joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 on the first part of the question joe that yeah we dont think theres when we look across the portfolio in asia theres any meaningful impact from stronger us dollar apart from potentially in smaller markets for example in sri lanka but i mean thats not all dollarrelated but at a sort of big macro level we dont think the strength in dollar has a material impact on us as we look out on credit quality across the region joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd its very helpful on both points thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator thank you our next question is from the line of fahed kunwar from redburn your line is open fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd hi there thanks for taking my questions and good luck ewen with your future career just a couple of questions for me the first one was just back on impairments im sure its pretty my understanding but when you look at the million cre overlay and the million uk overlay if i look at your overall coverage ratio on your loans to customers its pretty much flat at which is about the same as and fy and i would have expected that to go up if a lot of the provisions youre taking are just reserves rather than treating underlying delinquency so why hasnt that coverage ratio stepped up are there other moving parts obviously the writeoffs and underlying delinquencies that would be my first question and my second question just following on from an earlier question when you talk about your greater than guidance on cet1 from first half have you factored in potential risk migration from higher loan losses falling cre within that or if we saw increased migration would that be a risk to that greater than cet1 guidance from one half thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc on the second question yeah weve clearly factored in yeah a view on what the economic outlook is and what the impact on ratings migration would be as a result of that and you can see what our assumptions are on the macro outlook from our ifrs scenarios so yeah clearly within that in some markets there is an element of ratings migration that weve built into our rwa forecast and capital forecast on your question on impairments i mean i guess its hard to answer the question on a macro level on the commercial real estate portfolio in china we have definitely increased the level of overall provisioning against that portfolio yeah and then on the uk again im sort of struggling to get my head around the sort of takeoff of the provisions we had at the beginning of the year because of covid and the putting back on provisions that were now putting back on i think netnet we put more on in the uk than we took off at the start of the year but look ill get the ir team to follow up with you on the specifics but i think on the two portfolios that were sort of most focused on at the moment provisioning levels are higher than where they were at the beginning of the year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and i think there are some currency impacts on the balance sheet as well but the ir team can follow up on that fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd thanks guys operator thank you our next question is from ya noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator thank you our next question is from ya fei tian from citi the line is open ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd thank you for taking my question ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi morning noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc morning ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd hi morning ewen all the best to your future career and i have two questions the first one is just to follow up on that revenue and cost guidance and making sure i heard it correctly so assuming constant currency revenue is billion higher and i guess cost guidance hasnt really moved inflation does that imply on a pre provision basis youre guiding for billion higher of ppop so that is the first one and then second question is around the exit of canada business compared to many other markets that hsbc is exiting canada is actually quite a profitable market with midteens roe so just want to understand what is the rationale for that exit and as strategically as you look at the footprint of hsbc are there any further markets that you are reviewing at the moment thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to take the first one ill take the second hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look thanks youve got our guidance exactly spot on ie on a constant currency basis revenue is up billion no change in the cost guidance so on a preprovision level there should be a billion increase and if you think about the guidance that weve given today on ecls that even after ecls there still should be a net improvement on our guidance on a pretax basis noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you and on canada let me explain some of the rationale as to why were considering alternative options on canada firstly youre absolutely correct the business has performed well and is performing well with a return on capital above our cost of capital and a very strong recovery post covid the team had done an extremely good job rationale for considering alternative options are as follows first our market share in canada is around about and second its largely a domestic business the international connectivity between our canadian business particularly in wholesale banking and supply chain finance is less internationally connected than many other markets that we operate in and then thirdly weve had strong interest in our business from the point of view of other banks looking to buy it we clearly have to consider on behalf of all shareholders is the value that they would attribute to that business significantly greater than the value of holding our profit stream within hsbc and were testing that at this point in time by looking at the strategic options our assessment is there is a reasonable probability that the value will be significantly accretive and therefore its right that we consider that option strategically as i said our market share is in the category and the international connectivity of that business is relatively low so thats why weve given serious thought to an alternative strategy for canada but i reemphasize the management team in canada have done an excellent job then you asked me the question on do i consider that same evaluation for other markets and clearly we always look as a management team on the performance of our businesses the value in our hands relative to the value in others and also the strategic importance so we do do that but at the moment were only looking at commencing a process on canada and i can probably anticipate your second question so let me deal with that now on mexico and if i do the same analysis on mexico i start with a market share analysis where depending on the product line or customer segment we have somewhere between a and market share of the business in mexico so a much stronger market share position we have strong growth being achieved in our mexican business at the moment with significant upside potential and i think thats particularly true as we believe that as an international bank in mexico relative to other competitors our position as an international bank is being enhanced thirdly we believe that the supply chain interconnectivity between mexico the rest of the world and the us will actually increase in volume of business and business opportunity because it is an important manufacturing base hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 into the us and thats at the core of what we do and we have a very strong market share position in retail banking in mexico with strong interconnectivity between retail and corporate banking in mexico as a result of the payroll services and we also believe that weve got the strong shareholder value accretion potential by holding our business in mexico so were not going through a similar process on mexico we think we have good opportunities to continue to grow that business its starting from a stronger position and its not my intention to sell mexico so hopefully that was a reasonably comprehensive answer as and when we make a final decision on canada we will update you on the outcome of that process thank you ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd thank you its helpful noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator thank you our next question is from tom rayner from numis your line is open tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good morning everyone ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd hi there could i just ask on the cost target for next year please the in because i think everyone appreciates its a pretty tough target given the inflationary environment ewen i think youve said in your chat at the start that its going to need active cost savings to deliver and now you pointed out ewen it was fairly key in terms of the cost transformation and installing disciplined cost management so i guess my question is now that the cfo is leaving is there a risk that hitting the target may become more dependent on paring back investment rather than finding additional cost savings thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i can respond to that very categorically there will be no easing at all in our cost discipline im absolutely committed to that cost target ewen has done a tremendous job on driving cost discipline into the bank but i share that agenda and im committed to that agenda as weve said in the past weve got a headline target of around we know that thats challenging in a high inflation environment but we also know weve got cost savings coming through next year from the transformation hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 program weve already embarked upon and thats the equivalent of its about billion of flowthrough savings we also know were identifying additional costsavings opportunities through further simplification further digitization and further organizational change and that can add to that underlying capacity to pay so im not going to pretend in a high inflation environment the is easy but im also going to be remain absolutely committed to delivering that i thank ewen for all of the great work he has done on instilling those disciplines in the bank but i will make sure those disciplines remain and are committed for the future so theres no weakening in that target tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay okay thank you and best wishes ewen in whatever you do next ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd thank you operator thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator thank you our next question is from manus costello from autonomous your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys i actually just had a couple just to triple clarify on the cost target for next year the base of which the to growth comes from is the billion fx adjusted not the billion that you have as a year todate fx average rate is that correct ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah the only caution i would put around that manus is that exchange rate is bouncing around so that was true at the end of september whether it remains true by the end of the year well see hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp sure noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc but its on an fxadjusted basis ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc but the thesis is correct were not trying to play games with fx and setting that target manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp yeah no it wasnt entirely clear from the release this morning given the way youve given the billion number that the million is the current starting point my second question is actually about the commercial real estate outlook in china when i look at your disclosures youre taking much higher impairment on your hong kong booked exposures in your mainland booked exposures and are the additional million of impairment youve taken this quarter mostly related to hong kong booked and why is hong kong so much worse is there a risk that that hong kong book could really accelerate away from you youve taken about or so far of the bookers impairment could that be materially higher if theres some kind of structural problem with your lending agreements in hong kong ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah yeah well its booked in hong kong its the offshore component of the china commercial real estate portfolio manus so yeah weve got just under billion of exposure just over billion of that is onshore and just over billion of it is offshore the offshore book is definitely weaker than the onshore book yeah so i would say if you look at the substandard weve provided disclosure on substandard and impaired yeah which is about from memory at midyear on the offshore book and about on the onshore book so you can see in that very very different asset quality considerations yeah a lot of the policy support thats going through in china is definitely providing a lot of support for the onshore portfolio providing a lot of liquidity support for the onshore portfolio and in some cases its a question of whether that liquidity for regulatory reasons can be used to support the offshore book so yeah we do expect there to be further provisioning against the offshore book but yeah to keep that in context billion is on a trillion loan portfolio so its just over of total exposure we have as a bank but noel i dont know if youve got other comments noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think its a fair assessment the offshore book has a different risk profile to the onshore but our clients and our onshore portfolio is a relatively highquality tier tier cityorientated book but what weve got to work out is how hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 the policy measures benefit not just the onshore business but the offshore and thats still an evolving picture and therefore weve got to keep that under close review manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp should we consider the offshore book at this point to be essentially unsecured if theyre not able to get access to any of the liquidity measures and the questions over collateral is it effectively an unsecured book that youve got offshore on that noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc relative to the onshore book it is less secure than the onshore book so that is a fair assessment but is it fair to say that the onshore policy measures will not benefit the offshore book no thats not a fair statement i think we have to see on a clientbyclient basis how much of the onshore liquidity support can then support that companys ability to service the offshore book so i wouldnt have a complete separation between on and offshore it will be client by client dependent ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah manus i wouldnt describe it as unsecured yeah the onshore book is typically secured against specific properties the offshore book has less specific security but there is security underpinning that portfolio but its not secured and its definitely not unsecured it sits somewhere between those two manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you very much guys operator thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator thank you next question is from the line of martin leitgeb from goldman sachs your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hey martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international good morning hey ewen let me echo first of all earlier comments and thank you ewen for the good collaboration over the years and all your patience with our questions if i could just have two one on pass throughs and one on asset quality i was just wondering in terms of passthroughs earlier comments were on passthroughs being more benign compared to assumptions you have made earlier in the year i was just hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 wondering have you seen any meaningful signs of attrition in your core markets hong kong and uk ringfenced bank in terms of other accounts or current accounts into higheryielding accounts is it something which has started to trend higher and could imply higher passthroughs going forward and secondly on asset quality i was just wondering what are the main ramifications you think higher mortgage rates in the uk will have i think most recently mortgage rates headline have increased to a level of around and i was just wondering from your uk business perspective what are the main implications of mortgage rates at such a level thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc noel do you want me to go noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah yeah please please ewen go on ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look on the passthrough levels martin they have been i guess below expectations so far but i think they have been rising and as i said in our guidance weve made some reasonably conservative assumptions and cautious assumptions on where deposit betas go to from here but implied in that comment is materially higher than to what weve seen todate and again hence why the caution on using net interest rate sensitivity tables at this point because theyre based on a deposit beta which i think are becoming increasingly less relevant as we get to higher rates we havent seen any material attrition where we are seeing is migration out of noninterestbearing current accounts and savings accounts and yeah were starting to see that trend now in hong kong pick up a bit given where rates are but again just as a reminder typically if you looked in previous cycles our extent of deposit migration out of noninterestbearing current accounts has been well below sector averages in hong kong on asset quality again the book in the uk is typically a mix of twoyear and fiveyear fixed so yeah the impact of that for those higher rates will take time to roll through the book they are typically stressed when we put them on to rates of up to so yeah and if you you can look at our ifrs modeling yeah and look at the downside one and two scenarios if you want to look at the potential sensitivity we have to higher provisioning levels if you want to take some more adverse scenarios on the outlook for the uk but we think as we sit today yeah were not complacent about it but we think for most of our customers those higher rates are affordable given on the stress analysis we put on when those loans were put on martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international thank you very much operator thank you our next question is from raul sinha from jpmorgan your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hey raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good afternoon everybody thank you so much for taking my questions and my best wishes to ewen as well noel if i can start with a followup on your commentary around canada and mexico im just trying to understand your reaction function to any incoming capital proceeds that you might generate from an ma how would you think about capital deployment if you were to reach a position in excess would you consider further acquisitions i think thats one of the comments youve made publicly or should we expect that the majority of capital that is generated from these disposals should be returned to shareholders and the reason i ask for this is i think historically hsbc has linked various share buybacks to specific disposals and so i was just wondering whether you might be willing to link any subsequent disposalgenerated capital proceeds to a direct share buyback and i guess the second question i have is remaining on wealth management i was just wondering obviously weve been expecting a recovery in wealth in asia for a while and things are obviously still challenging on the ground i was wondering if you could update us in terms of your thoughts around how much how the business is positioned going forward and whether or not you see any structural challenges arising from recent developments in terms of wealth growth thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks raul let me deal with canada item first look its still very early in the process on canada so i dont want to be too definitive on use of proceeds but clearly there would be an expectation an element of a significant element of the proceeds there is i dont want to hang on to excess capital so as we get back into our target range of to which were going to do without the benefit of canada and then if we were to load a canada disposal in on top of that you would clearly have excess capital sitting at the group now it would be reasonable to assume that we may retain some of that capital to fund future growth that would emerge in and beyond but a good proportion of that capital would be available for distribution i dont want to give too much guidance on that at this stage let us get through the process on canada but i have no intention to hang on to excess capital over and above our target range unless we see good opportunities for profitable growth so i think it would be a reasonable expectation to expect some distribution of that capital back to shareholders in some form on wealth management i think on asia were seeing the hong kong market reopening activity levels domestically are increasing were seeing the hong kong market reopen internationally so i think the prospects are far better for than there have been throughout so i would expect activity levels to increase but what youll also hopefully see is a more stabilization in the equity markets so the investment environment has not been very supportive particularly in asia even though at the same time as the activity levels have been suppressed i think if we start to see a stabilization of the market thered be an increased appetite to use alternative investment products hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 and what i referenced in my opening comments is were building the platform for future earnings growth from wealth by continuing to accumulate net new assets and as we talked about in the last months weve accumulated billion of net new assets that billion given the suppressed market situation and investment appetite at the moment is not yet producing good earnings but it will do in the future that is a platform for future wealth earnings that were continuing to accumulate and i liken it to what we did in the deposit book we still accumulated deposits from good operating accounts particularly in wholesale banking and retail banking noninterestbearing operating accounts and we did that during the times when they werent earning a revenue stream and now were getting the benefit of that and thats exactly what were now doing on wealth were continuing to expand customer acquisition asset acquisition in order to build a platform for future wealth revenue growth thank you next question please operator thank you we have time for one more question from aman rakkar from barclays your line is open aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning gents ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you good morning aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd ewen i wanted to say congratulations noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi morning aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd and look forward to hearing what you do next can i just squeeze in two questions please sorry to come back to net interest income but the guide for next year i am really struggling to make sense of i do appreciate theres a greater than symbol thats sitting in front of that guidance but if i was just to mechanically take your billion guide this year the  exit nim run rate or nii run rate annualizes at around billion for next year so i mean youre basically assuming absolutely no incremental rate benefit in your indiscernible the assumptions that must sit behind that must be extremely conservative i appreciate youre talking about betas above please can you help us just understand a bit more exactly if theres something were missing and the extent to which those numbers are conservative and then secondly i wondered actually if you had an update for us on the impact of ifrs on your pl im mindful that were some kind of two months away actually from the implementation of it youve given us some guidance before could you help us understand the kind of the impact on nii fees and costs the reason im hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 asking is because your fee income performance your noninterest income performance in  is actually quite robust if i add back in the million as marktomarket negative that you had youre actually annualizing at quite a healthy clip i need to understand how much i should be taking off that for ifrs to work out if consensus next year is in the right place anything you can help us with there would be really appreciated ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah yes well id just start to start with ifrs look i appreciate that were sort of in an awkward phase at the moment with some of you modeling ifrs numbers in terms of your forecast and some of you still on ifrs and yeah were not able to and were giving our guidance at the moment based on ifrs rather than ifrs so look i think we are going to be in that sort of unsatisfactory position for a few quarters as we work to give you a sort of ifrs adjusted view of the world in the coming quarters but just to repeat what we said a couple of quarters ago we expect reported earnings to be down by around twothirds i think as part of that you need to adjust out the impact of mcu and we expect tnav to be down around billion and that the net impact on rote as a result of that to be relatively de minimis so i think yeah the latest internal numbers were looking at is around basis points of impact on rote but those numbers are still sort of being worked on so look i appreciate its an unsatisfactory position for all of you we are working as hard as we can to get to a position where we can provide you clarity or better clarity and when we can well update the market just on the comments on yeah the maths of times billion to get to billion i think you do need to add the billion on top of that for the switch into trading income that is an uplift in the guidance that were giving and an addition to that annualized rate of billion so i think we would say billion plays billion in your maths and then i sort of revert back to the conservatism or caution on other assumptions were making look and the reason for that is just we genuinely think we are facing a relatively unprecedented period given the sharpness of rate rises that weve seen and we are generally trying to be cautious on giving you guidance over the next couple of quarters but if we find going into  that our assumptions can be upgraded im sure georges and noel will be talking to you about that at full year results aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much would you be tempted to kind of guide for your expectations for noninterest income next year based on your current understanding of the momentum ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc look at some point i think well be accused to providing a profit warning when were giving you guidance on net interest income noninterest income and costs indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc at least model on one of those items hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah indiscernible aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd go on yeah indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean joking aside if you think about the trends in noninterest income this year i mean i think you do need to add back about billion likeforlike on insurance mcu yeah i think some of the other line items when you go through it some have clearly benefited this year some have significantly underperformed when you go through the global banking and markets pl theres a lot of pluses and minuses in performance this year i think weve talked about wealth and the depressed conditions for wealth this year but even just on a pure technical basis i think you need to add billion back for the insurance mcu noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah and i think if you look at the underlying fee growth or the nonnii weve seen very strong global markets performance in the volatile markets weve seen suppressed eventbased fees because of the low activity in ma and capital markets we can each have a view as to whether some of that event activity will come back next year but theres a probability that theres an element of that going to be coming back next year and youre going to have a continuation of good fee growth on glcm or global payments solutions in both cmb and gbm i dont see that trend declining i see that trend continuing of good fee generation there and as i said earlier my expectation is therell be an opportunity for some growth in our fees around wealth management as both activities and markets start to pick up and investment starts to flow back into alternative asset passes but its unpredictable at this stage well have to see how next year goes but i think there are some elements of our fee performance that are going to be enduring aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc
