transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 excluding the impact of the pets best gain on sale synchrony delivered adjusted first quarter net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of this performance highlights the resiliency of synchronys earnings power over time as we deliver results while positioning the business for strong riskadjusted growth ahead our differentiated model enables us to assess and react quickly through cycles and environments as our broad product suite compelling value propositions and innovative technology continue to resonate with both our consumers and partners we opened million new accounts in the first quarter and grew average active accounts by our products and value propositions drove billion in first quarter purchase volume above the prior year and our highest ever first quarter performance health wellness purchase volume increased led by pet dental and cosmetic and reflecting broadbased growth in active accounts in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by spend both at our partners and outside of our partners digital purchase volume increased reflecting continued consumer engagement through growth in average active accounts in home auto purchase volume decreased as the strong growth in home specialty and auto network and the impact of the ally lending acquisition was offset by a combination of lower customer traffic fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices and in lifestyle purchase volume decreased reflecting the impact of lower transaction values dual and co branded cards accounted for of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased as our value propositions continue to drive increased engagement and growth synchronys outofpartner spend reflects a comprehensive range of categories industries and products and offers a deeper view into consumer behavior throughout the quarter spending in january was impacted by challenging weather conditions as average transaction frequencies declined versus the prior year in february and march however we saw a rebound particularly in non discretionary categories overall consumers focused on more nondiscretionary spend in the quarter and shifted out of certain discretionary categories like home furnishings travel and entertainment despite the change in mix however we continue to see broadbased growth in many discretionary and nondiscretionary categories across the business synchrony continues to see indications that nonprime borrower spend has slowed and our portfolios purchase volume growth continues to be driven by higher creditgrade consumers average transaction values among superprime borrowers continue to increase and similarly we see average transaction frequency growth from our prime and superprime segments these relative adjustments in consumer spend behavior generally reflect a financially healthy consumer who is continuing to become more selective in their purchases and align their cash flows a trend which has also continued to take shape in synchronys credit performance portfolio payment rates continue to moderate and reached for the first quarter about basis points lower than last year and about basis points higher than the average payment rate level across our first quarters from to synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 the relative pace of payment rate moderation has continued to slow from both a generational and creditgrade perspective which when combined with the spending trends weve observed reinforces our view that borrowers are generally reverting to spending and payment behaviors that are more consistent with prepandemic norms these trends are also supported by a number of our other consumer financial health indicators including a strong labor market and external deposit data that has shown relative stability across industry savings account balances taken together these dynamics are contributing to synchronys recent delinquency performance highlighted on slide where the yearoveryear rate of change has slowed as our portfolio has reached prepandemic ranges the normalization and recent stabilization of our delinquency performance has occurred at a more gradual pace than the majority of our industry peers underscoring the powerful combination of our disciplined underwriting advanced analytics and sophisticated credit management tools were encouraged by these trends and continue to expect our portfolios net chargeoffs to peak in the first half of this year we continually monitor indicators across our portfolio along with the broader industrys credit performance and continue to take credit actions to optimize our portfolios positioning for and beyond synchrony utilizes a broad range of proprietary and external data including payment behavior characteristics billions of transactions and credit bureau alerts to deliver actionable insights

executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys first quarter results reflected the combination of our differentiated business model and a resilient consumer in an evolving macroeconomic environment we generated billion in net earnings or per diluted share on a reported basis excluding the million aftertax gain from the sale of our pets best business we generated million in net earnings or per diluted share ending loan receivables grew to billion this growth reflected the impacts of the continued purchase volume growth an approximate basis point decrease in payment rate and the completion of our ally lending acquisition net revenue increased billion or driven by the pets best gain on sale of approximately billion which was reported through other income excluding the pets best gain on sale net revenue increased million or net interest income increased to billion driven by higher interest and fees this growth in interest and fees reflected the combined impacts of higher loan receivables a lower payment rate and higher benchmark rates and was partially offset by higher interest expense from benchmark rates rsas of million in the quarter were of average loan receivables a reduction of million versus the prior year driven by higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build which included a million build related to the acquisition of ally lending other expenses grew to billion primarily driven by higher employee costs in support of growth and our continued investment in technology our efficiency ratio for the quarter excluding the impact of the gain on sale was an improvement of approximately basis points versus last year next ill cover our key credit trends on slide at quarter end our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to in the prior year and basis points above our average for the first quarters of to our 90plus delinquency rate was versus last year and basis points above our average for the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 first quarters of to and our net chargeoff rate was in the first quarter compared to in the prior year an average of in the first quarters of to our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was up basis points from the in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting the impact of seasonal trends the reserve build in the quarter largely reflected the addition of the ally lending portfolio as brian discussed synchronys credit performance has been consistent with our expectations given that synchrony shares the consumer with our broader industry peers we continue to monitor our portfolio and the broader industrys credit performance as weve done periodically since mid2023 weve been taking incremental credit actions starting in march across specific segments of our portfolio that should reinforce our portfolios performance for and beyond as slide demonstrates synchrony has built a track record of achieving consistent attractive riskadjusted returns through changing market conditions this performance has been enabled by a combination of our disciplined underwriting which targets a to loss rate on average and our rsa which aligns program and portfolio performance we will continue to leverage our deep consumer lending experience our diversified product suite sales platforms and verticals and our sophisticated data analytics and technology to further deliver on that priority turning to slide synchronys funding capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with our consumers as we grew deposits billion in the first quarter deposits represented of our total funding at quarter end and are complemented by our securitized debt and unsecured funding strategies which each represent of our total funding during the quarter we issued million of secured funding and completed a preferred stock issuance of million which served to more fully optimize our capital structure total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were billion up billion from last year and at quarter end represented of total assets up basis points from last year moving on to our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony will continue to make its annual transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately basis points each january through the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet under the cecl transition rules we ended the first quarter with cet1 ratio of basis points lower than last years the net capital impact of our pets best sale and ally lending acquisition added approximately basis points to our cet1 ratio our tier capital ratio is unchanged compared to last year our total capital ratio decreased basis points to and our tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year during the first quarter we returned million to shareholders consisting of million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends as of march we had million remaining in our share repurchase authorization synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 as part of our capital planning approved by the board of directors our share repurchase authorization was increased by billion bringing our total authorization to billion for the period ending june furthermore the board intends to maintain our current quarterly dividend of per share synchrony remains wellpositioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan turning to slide for a review of our business trends as a reminder synchrony previously filed an 8k on march with a revised financial outlook including eps guidance for the full year of specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rule change and our product policy and pricing changes there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of the late fee related litigation that was filed in march the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the product policy and pricing changes we implement as a result of the new rule outcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties could impact the eps outlook looking at the remainder of the year synchrony will continue to execute across our key strategic priorities and prepare our business as we navigate an evolving operating environment we have commenced the implementation of our product policy and pricing changes the majority of which will be completed over the next two to three months and we anticipate having greater clarity on the impacts of these changes likely in the second half of the year in the meantime we continue to expect our business to demonstrate typical season patterns in many of our key metrics we expect net chargeoffs to peak in the first half of the year and that the reserve coverage at yearend should be lower than the yearend rate finally we expect that the rsa will continue to align with program performance and continue to function as designed in closing synchrony is focused on leveraging our core strengths to optimize our business position and build our long history of delivering steady growth and strong riskadjusted returns our depth of consumer lending experience informs our gotomarket and product strategies our investment in sophisticated credit management tools empower our agility and our rsa supports our financial resilience together our differentiated model continues to consistently deliver value to each of our stakeholders through changing environments i will now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d

sustainable strong results for our customers partners and stakeholders we are leveraging our proprietary industry and consumer insights our diversified products and platforms and our advanced data

we continue to partner with hundreds of thousands of small and midsized businesses and health providers to provide access to credit to our more than million customers for their everyday needs and wants synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so it seems like charges are coming in a little bit higher than expected but weve now seen delinquencies potentially inflect and starting to follow seasonal patterns so can you maybe talk about what this means for the fullyear loss rate and where do you see losses in the allowance settling out over the intermediate timeframe if your forward view proves accurate brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question ryan so again i think we have been somewhat clear that we believe chargeoffs when you look at the delinquency trend as we entered into that chargeoffs will peak in the first half of the year and decline i think you see that well certainly in the bend in the first quarter i think when you see the results in april when we put out our 8k you will see delinquencies down on both a 30plus and 90plus basis relative to what we just reported here today so i think when you start looking at that you look at the seasoning of the credit actions that we took really in the second third quarter of last year we feel good that the chargeoff rate will decline in the back half of the year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 and most certainly we havent changed our underwriting targets to be in the to range generally speaking so we feel good about that which leads us to the belief that if you see that lower net chargeoff rate in the back half of the year and you project that forward into that the reserve coverage rate should be below the rate that we had really at the end of last year and really the increase in the first quarter here was reflective more of the seasonal patterns than anything else ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then maybe as a followup so the rsa has ph weaken several quarters in a row was well below that to i think you had outlined in the prior guidance so maybe just talk a little bit about how youre thinking about the rsa for this is of course exlate fees and do you think the new normal for this is below that to youd outlined in the past thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah ryan as i look at the rsa trend the first quarter was ph impact clearly when you look at it yearoveryear on the higher net chargeoffs which is a substantial amount of the decrease in the rsa partially offset about a third of it offset by really nii growth and the nii was a little bit suppressed because you had the last full impact on your interest bearing liabilities if i take a step back for a second and think about the core business ryan i believe were at a point where we have peaked on assuming no rate increases peaked on our interest bearing liability costs as i talked about the net chargeoff rate peaking in the first half you should see an upward bias then in the rsa as we step through the remaining quarters of the year the other variable will be volume so even if you looked on a linked quarter basis volume being down and being down a little bit yearoveryear for some of the rsa clients will play a factor but it should trend upwards as we step through given the peaking nature of the interest bearing liability costs and chargeoffs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the call brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan operator thank you well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning i guess my first question is just on purchase volume obviously that continues to remain weak could we just talk about sort of how we get it back to a baseline that accelerates i know inflation is synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 sort of weighing in on the consumer but maybe just talk about whats driving that and how and when we get it back to a baseline thats higher brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sanjay maybe ill start on this and then pass it to brian i mean look i think generally were pretty pleased with the growth that were seeing in the business i think the consumer is still in good shape obviously the job market is very strong thats helping but you are seeing a lot of that spend being driven by the higherend consumer the higherincome consumer and thats actually not a bad thing i think theyre benefiting obviously the job market house prices are up stock prices are up on the lower end thats where youre seeing some of the slowdown and from a credit perspective thats not the worst thing i think we see people being prudent i think theyre managing to a budget theyre managing to their cash flows theyre not overextending so i think theres a positive readthrough from a credit perspective on that i dont know brian if you want to add anything brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the first thing sanjay and i want to remind people were comping off of what id say is a really strong quarter last year so when you look at up that is very strong thats a record for our company for the first quarter brian highlighted some of the differences i think youre plus on the higher ficos down a little bit yearover year on the lower ficos we are seeing most certainly the consumer step back in certain bigger ticket areas right these are going down in transaction values which i think you see reflected in the home auto purchase volume being down and really in lifestyle but we do see strength in those pockets our home specialty business is up in the double digits our outdoors business is up so its selective the consumer is just being more prudent with the dollars again we see transaction frequency up but the transaction value is down so the consumer id say is managing through this period so i wouldnt necessarily read too much into it that there is a big change in the consumer profile and what they are doing sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay very helpful thank you and i couldnt let you guys get away without a late fee question so maybe just as we are waiting here on the courts at this point maybe you could just talk about how youre planning for a midmay implementation and how much flexibility you have if there is an injunction after the current planned implementation period and any early observations on the pppc behavior changes i know most of that will be in the second half thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sanjay so we are not surprised this was the second question we thought it might be the first obviously we are waiting on the outcome of litigation that is uncertain but we are executing our plan we have said from the beginning that we werent going to wait for the outcome on litigation just given the uncertainty so we began the implementation of our changes in december we are already over done with those we have got them synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 sent out the changes in terms et cetera the vast majority of those will be done in the next two months so look were executing the plan in terms of timing our base case was october that assumed an injunction with that said it will be extremely operationally challenging to get this implemented in may but we are preparing for that as well as a scenario sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks sanjay brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay operator thank you well take our next question from terry ma with barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hey thanks good morning i just wanted to follow up on the product policy and pricing changes is there any way we should think about how those benefits materialize once its fully phased in is there a way to think about whether or not its a slower ramp through the year a step up or kind of like a quicker ramp brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks terry i will take this and see if brian has any followon i think what you should expect to see is beginning an impact a little bit in the second quarter more in the third quarter with regard to the mitigants and then it continues to build from there ive gotten the question in the past and we really hadnt talked very much about it when you think about how the apr phases in for the consumer so when the apr becomes effective which again think about that as days after notice you will begin to feel the effects of that i would say in the first months if you roll that out its in months so you begin to feel that out now some of the other fees that come in and some of the other policy changes they are more immediate when it comes through there now we certainly will see as that flows through there will be some adoption really relating to going with the estatements and things like that that will flow through different parts of the pl that we expect so again i think you begin to see a ramp with some of the things that are more immediate and it gives you a sense on how the apr comes in but thats why there was a blend in order to get to that neutrality point a little bit sooner than just relying upon aprs terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 got it thats helpful and then for my followup just had a question on your cash balances it looked quite elevated this quarter relative to last year any color you can provide there on how we should think about that going forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial terry to be honest with you we have excess liquidity this quarter i go back and attribute that really to the strength of our deposit franchise i think when you just look at the core retail deposits were up billion from the end of last year and then you put the seasonal nature of the cash that comes in it served us well as we purchased ally for ph million but we also got million coming in from the sale of the pets best franchise so i would say liquidity is kind of peaking so i think if you think about margin and the effects on margin as you step through net interest margin is probably at its low point for the year in the first quarter given all that excess liquidity and listen i think we have heard other lenders over the last week or two talk about balances being down flatter balance sheets thats not what were expecting so clearly were still in depositgathering mode we havent really done anything to significantly attract new deposits its just the strength and attractiveness of our digital franchise terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks terry operator thank you well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah guys morning thanks for taking my questions i guess just a little bit more on the net interest margin brian i know theres always a seasonal impact in  as you gather deposits to kind of prefund for growth later in the year and then you mentioned the petsmart sic pets best kind of causing incremental cash balances but maybe could you give us some sense for the parse out what drove the margin decline this quarter relative to say and then maybe talk about marginal deposit pricing and where youre kind of in the cd markets and the savings account markets and when deposit costs should level out brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thanks for the question john so when i think about yearoveryear net interest margin right its down basis points the biggest driver of that if i do net funding costs so think about your interestbearing liability costs offset by your income coming off the investment portfolio thats about points of decline that came off of that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 theres another basis points of decline of having a higher having a higher liquidity portfolio yearoveryear thats then offset by the interest and fee yield which is plus basis point again as we think about how that develops through the year the asset and the alr kind of mix will neutralize back out we believe weve peaked on interestbearing liability costs from here so in theory as you step through net interest margin should really improve as you move throughout the year to your second question around pricing really when you think about the various tenors if you looked at our month cd rate were down basis points from the end of the year down to a ph raise we followed other people down which is generally flat to the second quarter of all issuers or all digital banks do have promo rates so we have one promo rate still over which is our 15month and thats really to manage at the end of the day our retention on cds and be competitive with other people which have kind of offtenor i would expect as we see people who are trying to manage their balance sheet and their liquidity down well follow the market down here we generally lag the brickandmortar banks but we will follow the digital banks down as we move throughout the year the final piece id say john is we still have three rate cuts in but we didnt really have them coming into september so theres no real impact unless something was more significant and moved sooner in the year from the fed john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and then maybe this is a little sticky of a question but if and i know you pulled eps guidance but exrate fees would your original to eps still hold or are there other changes that we should consider reflective of kind of just the trend changes that we want to consider in terms of modeling brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so just to be clear john we put out the 8k on march that had the eps guidance we have not pulled that guidance we just didnt reiterate it because its only days ago so we didnt put it on the page this morning if i think about that core business what id say brian and i would probably tell you is that were ahead of what we thought we were going to be i think interestbearing liability costs are up but were better than our expectations chargeoffs generally ph in line with our expectations and then when you start to think about some of the things that ive highlighted about number one your interest bearing liabilities cost peaking number two chargeoffs peaking in the second half and i mentioned on this call that youre going to see a sequence of decline in delinquencies thats in line i think when you then think about the reserve rate being lower than i think that sets up and its consistent with the guidance we provided out on march but again its only days or so ago john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thats great color thanks so much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 operator thank you well take our next question from jeff adelson with morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions just on the credit outlook wanted to dig in a little bit more on the mid2024 versus first half just given the nice delinquency formation improvement youve been seeing and your second quarter tends to be the seasonally best for ncos just wanted to help understand what mid2024 looks like here is that more of a seasonally adjusted peak yearoveryear growth peak or maybe just help us understand what youre thinking about there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah maybe ill try to simplify this jeff but thanks for the question everything is seasonally adjusted so when we built our plan it has the seasonal overlays which have been muted the last couple of years given the normalization that happened as we moved back to the prepandemic levels of delinquency i would think about it in this way just fairly simple first half losses will be higher than second half losses and i think if you just kind of rolled most certainly our 30plus and 90plus out you can kind of see how that will play through if you believe that youre going to get a bend here in april ph further bend in dollars you can see how it flows out so i just think about it in halves to simplify it versus trying to get to an exact date when it peaks jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it again on the late fee you mentioned how difficult it would be to implement operationally in may could you just talk about what that specifically might look like for you and how we maybe can think about the to impact you laid out previously if that does happen and kind of as part of the question as well i know you mentioned of the changes are out can you just talk a little bit about the consumer behavior response rate in terms of how theyre reacting to those changes so far brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah ill take the first part of that so operationally its very challenging from a number of different angles and obviously its for the issuer but also the vendors that the issuers rely on i think its important to note too that this is across the industry its not specific to us everybodys got the same challenges if in the event we do have to implement this on may i think were prepared to make the systematic changes and things like that the real challenges come around terms changes and updating collateral and things like that so thats where a lot of the operational complexity sits and ill turn it over to brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so to try to provide a dimension really more a framework for how you think about it jeff our base case assumption as we walked in was an october implementation date we thought thats going to be the case there are a lot of scenarios between here and when the courts will take action on the pending litigation and injunction so its difficult to speculate on any particular scenario because its just so uncertain i think everyone would have thought something different at least everyone on this call would have had a different opinion synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 that being said if you want to think about a framework for one second number one id say this doesnt impact where you exit out of from ph projective whether its october or earlier than october that exit points exactly the same number one number two it doesnt really impact the visibility of our business and what were doing from our ph ppc changes that brian talked about how much weve rolled out so those two things fundamentally dont change that being said if you think about a may implementation date theres a much larger impact in on eps but then as you think about that eps generally then would be higher than either the october scenario or its significantly higher on an actual to basis as you look at it so once we have greater clarity with regard to when the actual implementation date happens or occurs or will occur well then provide incremental transparency relative to the financial implications both on and then try to dimensionalize for people as well but i think its important to understand those frameworks about how we exit and any incremental detriment in in theory gets a benefit in and then just on your last question on consumer behavior and impact id say we havent seen anything yet thats different than our expectations id say its largely in line but the only caution i would have is its very early theres a bleedin period for a lot of these terms changes but so far what were seeing from the consumer side is generally in line with what we expected jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks jeff operator thank you we will take our next question from saul martinez with hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi thanks good morning and thanks for the question so just to follow up on the response to the last question on the pppc impact so if i hear you right the march 8k the guidance that or the estimates that you gave there the offsets ranging from million to million pretax which does imply a pretty significant ramp given the time horizons you gave into the fourth quarter we should assume those are still good benchmarks to use and because it obviously does imply a pretty significant ramp in the back end of the year in terms of nii thats the other late fee impact so just want to make sure that those numbers are still applicable or am i missing something there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial well let me just start with thats based off on october implementation date and the way to think about it is you begin to have some of the pppc changes happen in the second and third quarters partially offset by rsa then you come into the fourth quarter and you would have the detriment from the late fee going away but a higher rsa offset in that quarter synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 obviously that all shifts if you went to an earlier implementation date so that range would change materially in a situation where you had a potential implementation date prior to october again i think if that does happen well come back and provide greater clarity on the impact on late fees as well as the impact on the changes that were doing saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thats helpful and i guess just a broader i guess a broader question you did in your presentation reiterate the longterm targets 25plus percent roa 28plus percent rotce i get the offsets and you guys are working to fully offset that but it is a pretty significant if it gets implemented it is a pretty significant reduction or source of revenue that effectively goes away and well see what happens with basel iii but at least maybe its not going to be an impact but the direction of travel at least on capital is moving higher im just curious like how youre thinking about the longterm targets for profitability going forward your degree of confidence in how you whether you think those are still applicable targets brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah obviously we look at it and brian and i have been very clear that the organization our goal is to be roa neutral at the end of the impact of the late fee rule change and we again when we get better clarity with regard to the actual implementation date we can talk a little bit about that timing so the goal is to get back to roa neutral and thats the plan that we are rolling out and beginning to execute today understanding there are a lot of assumptions with regard to consumer behavior that are in there and other things that can impact it that being said if you think about a more normalized environment right so i think interest rates are not normalized when you think about an inflation rate thats elevated when they normalize you should be able to come back to that roa profile thats there and thats one of the strengths of the rsa itself that kind of helps us get back to that from a capital standpoint i cant really forecast and im not sure other people can where exactly the fed may or may not go with regard to basel iii i mean most certainly there has not been a lot of support around that so well see what those changes are that being said we actually have excess capital and were going to continue to move down towards our target which helps us get to the rotce so again being focused on being roa neutral through the late fee rule change number one deploying our excess capital whether that be into rwa thats accretive to earnings and roa or ph whether i would return it back to shareholders our goal is to get back to those medium to longterm targets we put out a couple of years ago saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes good morning your capital position is still pretty strong i was just curious if you thought the cfpb changes could lead to some portfolio movements over the next year or two and do you see any more opportunistic deals like ally brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look were always on the lookout for potential acquisitions or new programs ally fit our business model perfectly its exactly the type of acquisition that we look for its in industries that we know really well we understand the products its a great cultural fit like it just it checked all the boxes so we have excess capital today we generate a lot of capital over the calendar year and if we have the opportunity to do something opportunistic we certainly have the financial resources to do it brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the only thing id add on to that just to dimensionalize it for you if you look at page of our earnings deck we show that the earnings power of this business does generate that capital if you look yearoveryear last months we generated cet1 just from the net earnings of the business so really positive effects that you can look at and lean into plus you have the excess capital that weighs between there and our target level of cet1 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah the only other point id make on this is we are very disciplined when it comes to accretive acquisitions that have a really good strategic fit i mean i think youve seen that discipline over the years we havent done really a large scale ma weve been very thoughtful about finding things that are relatively modest from a capital outlay perspective but are businesses that we can grow really well thats a great example of that a perfect example of that allegro i think ally is going to be a home run for us so we are very disciplined in terms of what we look for donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don operator thank you well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi guys two questions this morning first on just cfpb one of the consequences that the industrys raised in terms of the rule change is the loss of deterrence which suggests that dqs will be higher im curious if you guys synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 have had discussions with your accountants related to how you will treat reserve policies if you have higher delinquencies but potentially assume lower pullthroughs brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah rick thanks for the question well certainly weve had internal conversations about the effects of deterrence and its really going to be how we model any potential change in delinquency and again what youre looking at here are individuals who are making a choice not to pay those who lost their job or had a health event and rolled into delinquency youre not going to rehabilitate them this wasnt a deterrent for them they either roll to loss or roll to settlement et cetera this is people who made an active decision to prioritize one payment over another payment we would have to model that out and then well certainly get our accountants comfortable with how it is but again well have to see because no one really did a lot of test and control at this level of deterrence most certainly theres things done back in the card act that demonstrated deterrence but well have to see how it plays out rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you and then in terms of the concept of chargeoff peak in the middle of the year seasonality works in your favor really steadily over the next six months and then starts to reverse in the fourth quarter when youre talking about a peak are you suggesting that as we move into the fourth quarter chargeoffs will continue to decline or that they will normally seasonally rebound but perhaps not quite as much as they have in the past brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question again rick we havent given quarterly guidance again im just going to give you the framework we applied seasonal patterns to how the loss rate works again we believe were more normalized and back to the prepandemic levels and i think as you begin to see you will see again in april dollar declines in 30plus and 90plus which have a flowthrough effect both on the third quarter and the fourth quarter as they kind of come through so were not going to get into specific quarter guidance now but again the rates in the first half of the year will be higher than the rates in the second half of the year richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it brian thank you very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from brian foran with autonomous research please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 hi i was wondering if you could just speak to your annual internal stress testing process and its a little screwy i guess in this twoyear window because youve got the late fee folding in but then you would arguably hit the business with peak losses does that become a constraint at all for capital considerations or do you feel like you have enough excess capital and enough line of sight to this roa neutrality that you can kind of look through that maybe a temporarily elevated stress test result brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks brian so first let me just be clear we have submitted our capital plan to the fed were part of the horizontals were part of the ccar group albeit we do not get a stress capital buffer until so the process remains somewhat the same as in prior years other than well engage a little bit differently with the fed than we have in the past but again the stress capital buffer comes in when you specifically look at the capital plan that our board just approved and management presented to them there were scenarios or scenario in there around late fees and the impact of late fees that put in there that doesnt that informed our overall capital decision but doesnt necessarily restrict the plans that we had even if i came back and said i had an earlier implementation date which we talked a little bit on this call that would not necessarily interfere with our capital targets and our plans all thats subject to the normal things wed say is the market conditions and everything else brian but the impact of the late fee rule doesnt necessarily impact the capital plan that we announced this morning brian foran q analyst autonomous research thats very helpful and maybe if i could sneak in on competition are you generally seeing competitors in the market respond in common ways on these kind of pppc efforts is there any evidence of any points of big divergence or people breaking from the pack or is kind of everyone doing different combinations of similar things brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial we only see whats out there in terms of public changes in terms but i would tell you my expectation is that everybody is going to do a combination of the same things that were doing its a pretty i think its a relatively standard playbook you might see some issuers do a couple things differently but i think on the whole its going to be apr increases different types of fees et cetera to offset this and its important that we do our goal from the beginning has been to protect our partners and continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today and unfortunately thats impossible to do without these offsets brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the only thing id add brian i do think the one thing you will see we probably have been a little bit more ph or i should probably show it a little bit more sense of urgency and gotten out ahead of this based upon discussions with our partners so that may pay a little bit but i think brians right over the medium term here thats where youre going to see the convergence brian foran q analyst autonomous research thank you synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning some of your on that very last point you just brought up some of the peer card lenders that have somewhat smaller private label and cobrand card businesses have begun to indicate maybe a willingness to absorb the late fee the foregone late fees as a result of the rule change can you talk about if we do see that happen at some players where late fees are a smaller piece of their overall revenue but theyre in the private label and cobrand business do you view that as a competitive threat if they do absorb the impact brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i dont see it as a competitive threat today i think in our space and the vast majority of our business i think youre going to see issuers do the same types of things that were doing i think its going to be really important in terms of the economic sharing with the partners i think were obviously focused on providing credit to the customers that we do today and fortunately you need to do some of these things in order to protect that and protect our partners so i do think youll start to see and were starting to see this now youll start to see some issuers were building this into pricing models as we look at new business were starting to build it as we bring on portfolios from our competitors youve got to contemplate an late fee you have to assume that while were hoping for a better outcome on the litigation obviously youve got to build in scenarios where we have a much lower late fee so i think itll even out over time across the industry primarily in the space that we operate in today brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the one thing john if you just took it up a level for a second so if you had a theoretical case where someone who has a smaller business than ours decides to absorb some of that late fee what you end up into is a suboptimal return profile and inside a large institution while it may be immaterial the question will be does it attract capital and how long can you sustain that and weve seen over history businesses come out of flavor in certain larger institutions where this is a smaller part and this is what we do and the same way that we look inside our businesses our platforms and allocate capital to some of our better performing higherreturning portions of the portfolio that i think over time will have to happen in these institutions so im not sure that thats a longterm viable strategy if someone wants to do that but again its very theoretical your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it no that makes sense thanks for that and then separately back to the eps sorry to belabor that but i know youre not reiterating that to guide and just so i understand its just because it was only days ago and the underlying components that you had baked in at that point in march have not changed materially synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 enough to change how youre thinking about your underlying trends i know weve had moves in rates had some development on the late fee dynamics but i just want to make sure that the core expectations that were part of that to have not changed at all brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah again im going to just say it again we put that guidance out days ago i didnt feel a need to or nor i think brian felt a need to one put it back on his page or two kind of update it again what ive said is the quarter and the points i raised about net interest margin losses reserves positive on expenses i think should be viewed fairly relative to that kind of base bau performance of the business so were pleased on how were exiting out of the first quarter and moving in on a core bau basis john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay brian thanks for walking through that again brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thanks have a good day operator and we are almost out of our allotted time we will take one final question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for squeezing me in and good morning i just wanted to two big picture questions maybe to start first just on the competitive situation and really not so much necessarily on the new programs but just in terms of the financing offers that are already out there for consumers has the purchase volume been impacted at all by consumers just having more choices today like are there any market share or penetration rate statistics you can share in terms of how often consumers are turning to synchrony versus others as a percent of your ph retail or partner sales or anything like that im sure you track it brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah we do we track it by partner we look at the penetration rate sales on our card versus other products ill tell you generally were very pleased that inside of the majority of our partner programs that were gaining share i think one of the things that helps us do that as we think about a multiproduct strategy we see our partners engaging more on being able to offer a ph loving product maybe a secured card buy now pay later and i think thats helping us gain share if you stick to a oneproduct strategy i think over time thats a losing strategy and i think you will lose share which is why we think the multiproduct strategy over time is a winning one so we feel really good about our ability to continue to take share inside of our partner programs but also just more generally in even some of the smaller to midsized space synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you and then brian just last question in terms of your in the prepared remarks i think in the press release today you highlighted the partnership with small and mediumsized businesses as well as health providers i think the emphasis theres a little bit of a new emphasis on the small and mediumsized businesses relative to the old ones i was just curious is the growth focus at synchrony switching a little bit to smaller or maybe the more proprietary programs versus maybe the historical focus on just being the partner of choice for larger retailers brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial well i definitely think thats an underappreciated part of our business model i think people tend to focus on the large partner programs but we serve hundreds of thousands of providers and small to mediumsized businesses and sometimes that gets lost a little bit so were definitely leaning in more there id say weve shifted investment dollars into the health wellness space you see that paying off when you look at the health wellness numbers i think receivables were up like were really reaping the benefits of those investments so thats a very attractive space for us the large partner space is still very attractive as well but i think that part of the business always gets a lot of attention were trying to make sure that we talk enough about all the small to mediumsized businesses and the hundreds of thousands of dentists and pet care specialists across the country that we serve mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial great thanks mihir have a great day operator thank you and this concludes synchrony earnings conference call
