everyone were really proud of our synchrony team and the strong level of execution that enabled us to close the year out with such strong results including several company records our core strategy to drive sustainable growth at attractive riskadjusted returns is founded on three primary objectives first grow our existing partner programs and win new partners second diversify our programs products and markets and third deliver bestinclass customer experiences during we added partners and renewed another were excited about the prospects in both our existing portfolio and new partner pipeline to power innovative financing experiences and serve the everchanging needs of our customers as you know were constantly seeking opportunities to extend our leadership position and much of that will continue to be driven by the ongoing diversification and expansion of our distribution channels synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 to that end we acquired allegro credit at the beginning of the year a leading provider of pointofsale consumer financing audiology products this acquisition allowed us to deepen our foothold in the health wellness space reaching more providers and customers and empowering them with an expanded suite of financing products and services we also announced our strategic partnership with clover which will enable us to deliver our innovative products and experiences to more merchants and customers as a reminder our integration with clover will enable small businesses to access synchrony financing products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the clover pointofsale and business management platform in addition synchrony continued to expand our two main consumerfacing marketplaces mysynchronycom and carecreditcom during the year these marketplaces are broad and deep networks that provide consumers with a onestop shop to find a shop with merchant partners and providers as well as submit applications and service their accounts and through the broad reach easy accessibility and strong utility of these networks synchrony is driving strong repeat sales combined annual visits across these networks surpassed million by yearend and we drove about million referrals and received almost million provider views through carecreditcom repeat sales across our networks were in the fourth quarter of an additional metric that we are focused on driving is sales per active account which are about twice as high in our carecredit and home auto networks compared to the average buy now pay later products that we see in the marketplace this is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster synchronys ability to leverage our networks and drive new customers and repeat sales to our partners at higher spend levels has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator an important growth driver for our business another element of our continued diversification and expansion over the last year includes our health system initiative through which we successfully signed new systems bringing our total to by integrating with health systems through technology platforms like epic synchrony is able to meaningfully extend our customer and provider reach while also enhancing the utility of our carecredit card for example the epic mychart user base spans about million patients and by making our patient financing app available within the epic app orchard were able to provide those patients with expanded access to financing options wherever the provider or health system is part of the carecredit network across a broad range of needs from elective care to routine medical expenses and nonelective care needs in an environment where insurance coverage is increasingly limited but health and wellness needs are rising we are empowering more patients and providers with greater choice flexibility and utility as we expand our networks and integrate with more health systems so overall was a year in which we accelerated our business strategy through strategic partnerships like clover we can expand our reach by tens of thousands of new merchants through the expansion of our digital networks we can reach hundreds of millions of consumers and collectively the health systems with which we have launched carecredit in some capacity have over million patient visits no matter how you look at it synchrony is at the center of a large crosssection of commerce in the us regardless of whether the purchase takes place in person or digitally we connect almost million average synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 active accounts through seamless omnichannel experiences to nearly locations and we power their everyday purchases from furniture and home improvement to healthcare products and services car care needs and clothing jewelry and powersports with customized financing options that optimize value and outcomes for both our customers and partners the more consumers merchants providers and partners that synchrony reaches the more diverse the demand for products services and value propositions becomes so we continue to diversify both our products and programs in with the launch of our industryfirst program with walgreens and the introduction of our setpay pay in product in addition we continue to advance the growth of our synchrony mastercard which represents an important opportunity within our product strategy to drive highly scalable growth and aboveaverage returns to our business over the long term during the second half of the year we broadened our synchrony mastercard acquisition efforts to include new digital channels expanding our reach and accelerating our speed to market with the realtime activity and data capture along with our sophisticated dapply capabilities which include advanced prefill and credit decisioning insights we streamlined the application process and optimized the customer experience as a result active accounts grew in the second half compared to the first half of the year and thanks to the compelling value propositions we offer our sales per active account grew on the same basis of course as we continue to expand our wallet share synchrony is able to reach and serve more customers and provide them with more choices and greater value and as we strive to provide easy and comprehensive access to a broader set of financial products and services we are excited to launch paypal savings in the first quarter through this expanded partnership with paypal we will broaden the distribution of our savings product to reach a unique set of customers with key features and functionality including instantaneous fund movement between paypal balances no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals existing paypal customers will be able to quickly and easily open their paypal savings account inside the new paypal super app were proud to partner in this transformative initiative and remain intensely focused on continuing to elevate the customer experiences we power across all our partnerships it should come as no surprise that synchronys consistent investment in digital innovation has enabled each of our product and partner successes along our evolution we are continuously enhancing the ways in which we deliver simple and seamless customer experiences because the outcomes are far stronger for all of our stakeholders for example during the past year we upgraded close to million accounts across partners to our new alerts platform which delivers customizable email text messages and push alerts with realtime and rich transaction data and notifications we also rolled out some upgrades to our sypi platform including several new features like digital wallet provisioning and enhancements to push notifications and ebill collectively the availability of these features contributed to a increase in unique visitors in and growth in the number of payments we received in sypi synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 with the rollout of enhanced native acquisition capabilities via sypi and our client mobile apps weve grown new accounts for that channel by yearoveryear and more specifically by enabling wallet provisioning for cardholders to add their synchrony account to their digital wallet fourth quarter wallet provisions grew year overyear and wallet sales volume increased so when you put it all together the unique combination of our deep lending expertise the industrys most complete product set and our advanced digital capabilities has enabled synchrony to evolve into a leading financial ecosystem that delivers compelling outcomes for our partners and our customers there is no other industry provider that offers the full breadth and depth of digitallypowered financing products services and value propositions that synchrony does today and this ability to connect our partners and customers through bestin class omnichannel experiences is deeply resonating and driving record results for synchrony and our stakeholders in this past year we achieved almost million new account originations and record purchase volume of billion and a increase in spend per active account these milestones combined with strong credit performance and our continued discipline around riskadjusted returns and expense management enabled synchrony to deliver record financial results for the full year including billion of net earnings or per diluted share a return on assets and a return on tangible common equity as a result we were able to return billion of capital to shareholders including billion of share repurchases and million of regular dividends with that ill turn the call over to brian to discuss the fourth quarter performance which reflected broadbased momentum across our business brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results reflecting our differentiated business model and the strong partner and customer value propositions which have been made possible as we execute on our strategic priorities our net earnings were million or per diluted share we generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of these strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitallyenabled model combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our ecosystem not only were we able to support the strong seasonal customer demand with our diverse range of products but we were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong riskadjusted returns we achieved record purchase volume of billion in the fourth quarter an increase of compared to both last year in excluding walmart purchase volume was up double digits across four of our five platforms demonstrating clear broadbased strength through the range of diverse industry verticals we serve purchase volume per account also increased during the quarter up compared to last year and compared to the fourth quarter of excluding walmart synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the fourth quarter and increased from the prior year on a loan receivable basis including the loans receivable held for sale dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the portfolio and increased from the prior year average active accounts increased compared to last year and new accounts increased totaling more than million new accounts in the fourth quarter and almost million new accounts originated for the year as you may recall we reached an agreement for the sale of our gap portfolio which represented billion of loan receivables in our heldforsale portfolio at yearend continuing our commitment to achieving appropriate riskadjusted returns we are discontinuing our partnership with bp which resulted in the reclassification of approximately million of loan receivables to held for sale in december excluding the impact of our heldforsale portfolios loan receivables would have increased by versus the prior year as the periods strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate rsas were billion in the fourth quarter and of average receivables the million yearoveryear increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including receivables and purchase volume growth as well as the improvement in net interest income focusing on our credit performance provision for credit losses was million included in this quarters provision was a reserve build of million net of the reserve reductions from our heldforsale portfolios of million excluding the impact of our heldforsale portfolios the million reserve build reflected the impact of loan receivable growth within the context of our unchanged set of macroeconomic assumptions and credit normalization outlook which includes peak loss in the first half of other income increased million driven by a million gain in a venture investment while well provide more details later on in our discussion i want to highlight that the majority of the fourth quarter eps benefit from this gain was offset by unrelated asset impairments and certain opportunistic marketing investments we executed in the fourth quarter moving to slide and our platform results our home auto diversified value digital and health wellness platforms each continued to experience doubledigit yearoveryear growth in purchase volume reflecting strong diversified demand our lifestyle platform also experienced robust demand as purchase volume increased yearoveryear but faced a tough comparison to last years strength in power sports volume loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected the more modest growth versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates average active accounts trends ranged on a platform basis up by as much as in both diversified value and digital home auto lifestyle and health wellness average active accounts grew in the lowsingle digits were relatively flat the average active account growth in diversified value largely reflected the stronger retailer performance digital active accounts were up versus the prior year due to the greater engagement across our existing customer base and new programs interest and fee trends while generally improved across the platforms continued to be impacted by elevated payment rate synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 ill move to slide to discuss net interest income and margin trends the accumulated savings by consumers combined with seasonally higher holiday transactor behavior impacted payment rate during the fourth quarter as we progress through the period payment rate moderated somewhat from the third quarter levels but increased with the seasonal holiday spend we typically see in december payment rate for the period was about basis points higher than last year and basis points higher than our fiveyear historical average when tracking the account payment trends from the third to the fourth quarters we see a slight mix shift away from above and full statement balance payments towards more minimum and below minimum payments more specifically the percent of account balances paying their full saving balance decreased sequentially by approximately basis points and the percent of accounts paying between their minimum payment and their full statement balance decreased sequentially by approximately basis points the percentage of accounts paying their minimum payment or less than their minimum payment increased sequentially by approximately basis points we continue to expect payment rate to gradually normalize as customer spend remains robust the consumer savings rate is declining and industrywide forbearance expires while it is difficult to predict elevated consumer spending lower consumer savings inflationary pressures and return to full financial obligations has begun to impact accumulated savings levels by consumers which we believe will lead to a moderation in payment rate fourth quarter interest and fees were up approximately reflecting average loan receivable growth net interest income increased from last year reflecting the yearoveryear improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of a 113basispoint improvement yearoveryear driven by the mix of interestearning assets and favorable interestbearing liabilities costs more specifically the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by basis points from to driven by average receivables growth and lower liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for a 96basispoint increase in our net interest margin interestbearing liabilities costs were a yearoveryear improvement of basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates this provided a 42basispoint increase in our net interest margin the loan receivable yield was a yearoveryear reduction of basis points this resulted in a 26basispoint reduction in our net interest margin next ill cover our key credit trends on slide elevated payment rates continue to drive yearoveryear improvement in our delinquency metrics our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and our 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year when removing the impact of the heldforsale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the fourth quarters of this year and last year the 30plus delinquency metric would have been down approximately basis points versus basis points and the 90plus metric will be down approximately basis points instead of basis points our portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive strong yearoveryear improvement weve seen in our net chargeoff rate which was compared to last year a 79basispoint improvement our synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from in the third quarter lets move to slide to focus on expenses other expenses of billion include the impact of million of asset impairments and million of certain incremental marketing investments excluding these impacts other expenses increased compared to the prior year focusing on employee compensation fourth quarter was impacted by two key factors one higher hourly wages as we raised the minimum wage to during the third quarter and second higher incentive compensation as levels were negatively impacted by the pandemic the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was compared to last year excluding the impacts of the gain on our venture investment the asset impairments and the incremental marketing investments the efficiency ratio will be even with these adjustments our efficiency ratio remains elevated compared to our historical average due to lower revenue which has resulted from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables we will continue to take a disciplined approach to expense management while also maintaining the pace of strategic investments in the business this continues to be a clear point of differentiation for synchrony as we demonstrated through our investor day symphony leverages our legacy of operating smaller dollar balances to acquire originate and service our accounts more efficiently than other general purpose issuers our cost to acquire is half that of private label peers and a quarter of the broader industrys average its also important to remember that throughout the course of the pandemic we have maintained a relatively steady level of marketing spend to stay engaged with our customers much of which is largely contemplated within the rsa as a result synchrony generally does not ramp up our marketing expenses in order to compete for new customers similarly we consistently prioritize investment in our business and technological innovation the digitallyenabled products and services that we offer and the seamless omnichannel experience that we power for some of the most sophisticated technology partners in the world would not be possible without our tireless focus and steady investment in innovation year after year so while the return of our operating efficiency ratio to approximately will primarily be driven by the normalization of payment rate and thus the recovery of revenue we are confident in our ability to continue to achieve marketleading operating leverage as loan growth continues now lets move to slide and discuss another core strength of synchronys our funding capital and liquidity given the reduction in loan receivables in and early coupled with the stickiness of our deposit base we have generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during the year while we believe its prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during periods of uncertainty weve been actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile as a result of this strategy there was a slight shift in our funding mix compared to last year our deposits declined by million from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with securitized funding comprising of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising at quarterend synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equate to of our total assets down from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which has two primary benefits first it delayed the effects of cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second it allowed for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter with cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year during the first quarter of we will recognize the first portion of the cecl transition adjustment which reduced our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points as a reminder the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet this transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics we continue to execute on our commitment of strong capital return to shareholders by returning billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through million in share repurchases and million in common stock dividends for the year we returned billion including billion in share repurchases and million in common stock dividends given the strong performance of our business during the year our board approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization through june by an incremental billion as of december we had billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization we have begun our normal capital planning process and well provide an update to our planned capital actions once approved our business generates strong returns and considerable capital reflecting our commitment to drive consistent growth at attractive riskadjusted returns the scalability of our technology platform and our continued cost discipline we have considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy either through growth or returns to shareholders accordingly we will continue to take an aggressive but prudent approach to returning capital to our shareholders guided by our business performance market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory considerations finally let me focus on our outlook which is summarized on slide of our presentation assumes a stable to improving macroeconomic environment and a wellcontrolled pandemic for the upcoming year we expect consumer demand to remain robust supporting broadbased purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve as consumer savings begins to decline and payment rate moderates wed expect purchase volume growth to moderate somewhat we expect our net interest margin should reflect the trends consistent with those during the second half of and should follow historical seasonality with the advance of our heldforsale portfolios in late  we anticipate some excess liquidity creating a modest headwind to nim in both the second and third quarters and as weve done in the past we will work to reduce this excess liquidity quickly synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 as payment rates moderate and credit trends normalize through the gradual rise of delinquency and loss we expect higher interest and fee yields to be offset by higher reversals our current expectation is that delinquency will peak in the fourth quarter given our reserve levels at yearend wed expect reserve builds in to be generally assetdriven and partially offset by the approximate million of final reserve reductions associated with our heldforsale portfolios rsa expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth but should begin to moderate as net chargeoffs rise in terms of operating expense we generally expect quarterly expense to run in line with the fourth quarter levels excluding the impact of asset impairments and certain marketing items we discussed earlier and lastly with regard to our heldforsale portfolios we anticipate conveyance to occur in the second quarter producing a nonrecurring gain on sale of approximately million we expect to redeploy this gain through completely offsetting incremental investment in our business thus be eps neutral for the full year so putting it all together synchronys differentiated model is powering strong growth at attractive riskadjusted returns through changing market conditions and were emerging from the pandemic with considerable momentum as we continue to leverage our core strengths our diversified portfolio which provides resiliency and sustainable growth our deep industry expertise advanced data analytics and digitallyenabled product suite the combination of which enables strong riskadjusted returns and our scalable technology platform which powers efficient customer acquisition and servicing as well as swift partner integrations synchrony will continue to engage more customers drive greater lifetime value and deliver sustainable growth at peerleading riskadjusted returns so as operating conditions continue to normalize we remain confident in our ability to achieve the longterm operating metrics we laid out at investor day to continue to drive considerable value for all of our stakeholders i will now turn the call back over to brian for his concluding thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian i could not be more proud of the synchrony team and all that we have achieved this year for our partners customers and stakeholders whether its been through investments in our digital innovations strategic partner integrations expansion into new distribution channels or the addition of new product offerings synchrony has continued to evolve and enhance the ways in which we connect our partners and customers through our financial ecosystem this has positioned us as a leader in the digital commerce revolution with very exciting opportunities ahead of us we will continue to win new partners and renew existing ones and at the same time well further diversify our programs products and the markets we operate in and of course underpinning it all is our laserlike focus on our integrated product set and providing that bestinclass customer experience that drives value loyalty and superior outcomes for our partners and customers synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 synchrony will continue to outperform over the long term as we provide our partners and customers with the power of choice as we deliver on our key strategic priorities we will continue to drive consistent growth at attractive returns and unlock even greater value for our stakeholders with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and from kbw we have sanjay sakhrani please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess i have a question for both brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey how is it going question for both brians on loan growth i know payment rates are sort of weighing against the underlying loan growth expectations but your longterm targets are sort of highsingle digits to lowdouble digits some of your peers are at their average if not above their average maybe you could talk about whats driving sort of the weakness relative to your longterm expectations or do you expect in to get there thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah sanjay maybe ill start and then ask brian to comment i would say look generally we feel really good about the operating environment right now we feel really good about where the consumer is last year was a record year in terms of purchase volume on our products and if you look at that one of the things thats really encouraging is if you look at that by demographic a lot of that is actually driven by millennials and gen z sales on our accounts with millennials and gen z were up compared to if you look at baby boomers that was up only so as you think about that mix shift our products are definitely very attractive to that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 younger demographic we also generated million new accounts for the full year so we actually feel really good about the growth prospects and as you said the thing thats a little bit difficult to call right now is the payment rate but i think if we see payment rates just normalize a bit they dont need to go all the way back to prepandemic levels if they just normalize a little bit here in we could definitely see loan growth in the highsingle digits for the full year i dont know brian if youd add anything to that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah the color id add sanjay is that when you look across purchase volume across all our segments were seeing strength in all the platforms so that diversification is pulling through and i think when theres a comparison to some of our peers what gets lost here is the resiliency in our business right we do not have as much volume decline as others or asset decline as others last year so we are being more consistent with that and listen i definitely agree as we entered into we came off a record purchase volume i think as we think about the first month of the quarter were seeing a strong midteens growth in purchase volume as that continues and we do see and im sure well talk later in the call on payment rates we are seeing some moderation so i do think you can see that highsingle digits and in certain scenarios we have one scenario that says you can give me in double digits with regard to loan growth so we feel really good about the model and where were entering brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the last thing ill add sanjay just if you look at that across the platforms its pretty broadbased if you look at purchase volume digital was up dv up we got a ton of room to grow in health wellness their sales were up in the fourth quarter so again pretty broadbased growth and its nice to have turned the corner with all of our platforms having positive receivable growth yearoveryear in the fourth quarter sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats wonderful maybe another revenue driver you guys sort of talk about the nim brian wenzel and i know theres a lot of liquidity and all this other stuff that affects that metric but as we think about the yield i see that last bullet says higher interest and fees offset by higher reversals is that one for one or do we expect the yield to improve over the course of this year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way i would think about it sanjay is as you see the payment rate decline youre going to see the yield go up on the book right the reversals that come ultimately will be with the chargeoffs which will trail that and its not one for one it never has been the impact on the nim this year it is benefiting from reversals but not necessarily the key driver behind it so it trails and it wont be one for one synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 operator from credit suisse we have moshe orenbuch please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks brian wenzel i guess you talked about the normalization of the efficiency ratio and in this environment investors are paying a lot more attention to expenses and costs and you said that youd be driven by the revenue that has been kind of deferred lost suppressed can you talk about how you think about how large that is and over period of time that comes back brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah a great question moshe first of all i want to start with the expenses were up when you strip out the impairment and discrete items that we elected to execute based upon some gains we had in the quarter our expenses are up yearoveryear and if you think about that just to start a lot of it is employeedriven right we increased our hourly wage to employees we also had some onetime adjustments relative to some critical roles in the organization you think about data scientists technology et cetera so the base in the run rate as we see going forward is pretty stable and as i said in my prepared remarks first of all we dont have to inject a lot of money into this in order to drive our growth so the expense base as we step through each of the quarters will be relatively consistent as you think about the efficiency ratio clearly the revenue and the yield is lower than we anticipated so i think over the course of that call it the revenue normalization between and you will see come back and we see a pathway back to that but right now were managing hopefully tightly to the dollar amount as we step through again its mainly volume oriented now with more active accounts and higher volume that go through the associations or networks moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc so i guess just to be clear your cost base is going to be closer to fixed as volume expands and maybe credit normalization causes the rsa to actually benefit revenue over the course of the next several quarters is that what we should be thinking brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i would say on a dollar basis that would generally be true i think what were going to drive is there will be an increase in the variable components of that but well drive productivity to offset that and keep the expense base relatively flat so i wouldnt say theres a ph ship to be fixed its were going to drive productivity and get operating leverage moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right were acting like fixed and fixed yeah i got it okay thanks very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 thanks moshe have a good day operator from goldman sachs we have ryan nash please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys good morning kathryn brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brian maybe as a followup to moshes question if i look at the expense guidance i adjust for the million i think it points to about to expense growth so i just wanted to clarify for is the expectation that youre going to generate positive operating leverage can you maybe put some parameters around how to think about expenses relative to the revenue backdrop and then more specifically the slides talk about you reinvesting the million from the gain is that included in the expense outlook and should we then view that as a onetime stepup or will it remain in the run rate and i have a followup brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so thanks for the question ryan let me deal with the latter part of your question the million and any potential offsets we have will not be in the run rate they will be onetime so when we actually make those decisions and that could be a wide ranging effect that could deal with some of our fixed costs and again continuing to adjust for the way in which we work there could be some investments in marketing programs and well highlight those but it should not go into the run rate of the business and would be additive to what we have here on the page i think generally when you think about the expense base we are going to generate positive operating leverage and thats the way the model was set up so that as we think about the expenses this year our view would be that we would have greater growth relative to the assets and the revenue so we do believe were going to get operating leverage were going to manage the positive operating leverage throughout as we step through ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks and if i can ask a followup question on credit loss is obviously at very very low levels and weve seen a little bit of increases in delinquencies and chargeoffs so i was wondering can you maybe talk synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 about any noticeable trends youre seeing across the portfolio are you seeing any more normalization in the near prime relative to the prime and then second brian just to clarify the allowance at versus day one cecl although i recognize that is seasonally low you mentioned it being assetdriven so is day one cecl still the eventual destination and maybe can you just give us some color on how to think about the trajectory of the reserve over time thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so let me im probably going to give you a longer answer on credit ryan because i do think its important to get this background to specifically answer your question we have not seen anything discernible in our results and ill explain to you where we come out but theres nothing that we see that says this is performing worse than our expectations i think we understand theres a lot of concern about what the term credit normalization means and how fast that comes and the ranging damage i want to give you a framework first we talked about earlier in the call in my prepared remarks about the delinquency being basis points better and basis points better than previous periods when you exclude the held for sale so the delinquency formation of how that will give you lost content for the first half of the year is in great shape i think ryan when we look at the vintage performances both on a cumulative basis and a coincident basis and look at it from forward in these sixmonth kind of tranche views each of the vintages from through have improved and we see no deterioration in those vintages as we sit here at the end of when you look at both and are significantly better than all of the prepandemic vintages significantly better when we look at specifically thats a little bit worse than because we took some credit refinements we dont believe we have added incremental risk in but slightly worse performance but again significantly better than prepandemic i then think you have to think about three other factors ryan as you think about credit the first is our credit strategy and multiproduct strategy our credit strategy is we have a tighter ph loan grow line strategy we have tighter account management strategies which gives us lower severity as you head into this normalization period so we think well be less volatile and thats been demonstrated when you go back and look at the loss curves both in the gfc recessions and then the pandemic and then i think when you look at the tools we outlined on investor day the increase in data analytics the unique sources the ability to be more surgical we can control credit as we step through and then the last thing is the rsa right the rsa will ultimately take those chargeoffs and our partners will offset that you combine that with the revenue generation this would give you a resilient riskadjusted margin as you kind of step through so thats how i think about credit i think brian and i and leadership team are really comfortable with how credit will develop in into with regard to your second question on the allowance we dont have a differing view that says were not going to get back to day one cecl it really goes back to what you think your target loss rate is and what your mean loss rate is and we dont really have a fundamental view synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 therell be some portfolio mix that comes into that but i think we ultimately can migrate back to that assuming thats the view that we hold its really the timing and that generally if you hold that view there could be offsets to assetdriven provisioning as we step through so i apologize for the long answer but i think a framework for how you think about and talk to your customers operator from citi we have arren cyganovich please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you on the nim outlook there i was wondering when you look at the guidance there on the kind of levels which is i guess around i would have expected that to rise a bit more with the rate increases were seeing how many rate increases do you expect for the year and what are some of the other aspects that are keeping that somewhat lower brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so with regard to expectations for rate increases we have three rate increases is our current view obviously the market i think depending upon the day may be different than that but you got to remember in our portfolio less than of our receivables are variable rate and then when you factor in the transactors its rough i think less than so were not going to be highly subject to id say nim movements there could be basis points basis points potentially as it relates to nim but to be honest with you its not a significant driver and at the end of the day we intend to run our book really on a rateneutral scenario were slightly assetsensitive but not a lot arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay got it and then its helpful to have a discussion of expense base ph with a counter revenue item the loyalty program cost kind of ticked up a decent amount in the fourth quarter i guess likely from i guess the sales volume you had there but whats the outlook on your loyalty program cost ahead brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah great question brian and i look at this thats not necessarily a bad thing it really means that our customers are engaging with our products and driving volume so youre right it is volumedriven number one and you can see that in our dual card volume our cobranded volume our new programs are contributing to some of that rise and then the final thing is obviously value proposition changes where we refresh value props to drive volume factor in there the other important element that sometimes gets lost is this is a program expense where approximately of this is shared back through the rsa so we dont bear the burden and i think again going back to the unique model we dont have to inject a lot of marketing to drive growth we dont have to inject a lot in the loyalty and then our partners are sharing both in the marketing expenses and the loyalty so theres a natural buffer in the rsa so again a lot of its offset in rsa and its generally a good thing that its rising means our customers are engaging with our products synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 operator from morgan stanley we have betsy graseck please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey thanks so much couple of questions here first on just expenses to tie that up a little bit i know youve got the longerterm guide on expense ratio out there from your investor day last year is that something we should be expecting you would be targeting over the next year or two or is that more like a kind of timeframe brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah first of all good morning betsy i would not consider that a related metric were in a transitory year relative to the revenue so i think you begin to look at that when you move into and how the revenue really develops again were going to control the expense dollars we can control that the actual output of that has a denominator thats a little bit less controlled given the elevation in payment rate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the other question just on expenses has to do with the investment spend youre making youve got the million gain and then youre going to be investing that and from the commentary it sounds like youre talking about making those investments like during the second third and fourth quarter next year is that a fair read of what youre telling us brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so i would look at the investment being primarily in the second and third quarter thats where wed like to have it in there to get the leverage effect of it obviously it will depend upon the types of actions and again i think there will be a combination of actions that both had tried to reduce the fixed cost of the business as well as incremental investments really to drive the growth side of the business so brian and i will review that with the team and set our plans out and hopefully be able to give you an update at our first quarter earnings call in april brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial its fair to say betsy were not going to make any investments that dont have a really good payback a really good return use of those dollars betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc are you talking more about like marketing or investments in the programs as opposed to technology is that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial its going to be a combination of things it will be and potentially could be well look at some of the fixed costs that we have in the business relative to facilities it could be refreshes of certain programs where we may reissue synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 cards and do things like that campaigns like that it could be in technology where we may try to accelerate and continue the acceleration of our digital capability so its a combination but brian has hit on it were going to go through a review and the best projects with the best payback and irrs will ultimately win brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial its usually two lists betsy that we look at one is to drive longterm efficiency in the business and the other one is to drive growth right both lists have great paybacks we have a really disciplined process around how we evaluate those investments and well obviously run that same play this year operator from wells fargo we have don fandetti please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning seems like the cfpb has been talking a little bit more about cards recently can you provide your updated thoughts on the regulatory environment and secondarily how is the pipeline for new partners and portfolios brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah hey don so look id say the regulatory environment has been fairly stable obviously we saw the cfpbs request for information regarding fees first id just say that we always strive to be very transparent in terms of our disclosures with our consumers we really dont have a lot of fees other than late fees as you know those are already governed and calculated by the cfpb were completely compliant with that and their guidance on late fees today so well obviously stay close to that but nothing more to report really at this point and then i would say generally the pipeline is strong across all five of our platforms a lot of nice new program opportunities in the pipeline that were looking at a lot of opportunities to partner on new distribution channels that were excited about so a pretty strong pipeline i would say theres not a lot of large existing programs out there right now a lot of them have been locked up but some really exciting new program opportunities out there so were excited about that donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks operator from piper sandler we have kevin barker please go ahead kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 thank you just a followup on that question your late fees are relatively high compared to the industry just given the amount of accounts you have so it naturally would be higher if the cfpb were to do anything or there was any regulatory changes do you feel like you have the flexibility to adjust your model to continue to generate similar type revenue trends just given your relationships with other merchants brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial well so just the first thing i would say that i mean we dont disclose the aggregate amount of late fees but the late fee dollar amount that we charge on accounts is again regulated by the cfpb and very consistent across all of the general purpose card players out there and look if something were to change on that front we could price for it in other ways and protect our revenue and our margin but look i think we just got to stay close to this as i said and i dont know brian if youd add anything brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah the way i think about it kevin is we look at it the average late fee for instance and being that were in the safe harbor with the cfpb it shouldnt be any real difference between us and id say industry participants i think if you go back historically under the card act our revenue when the card act changes went into place essentially remained the same we went back to partners and we worked that so i think historically weve had run the play where if the environment shifts with regard to how the revenue may or may not be impacted well work with our partners to again provide the value to our customers to them and then return an appropriate riskadjusted return kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you for taking my question brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks operator from jefferies we have john hecht please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning thanks very much for taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 hey john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey how are you guys just you talked about the rsa but just thinking like rsa the relationship to rising delinquencies or chargeoffs whats the timing there and is it kind of basis point for basis point and then also how do loyalty program costs kind of influence the rsa just trying to kind of think about those moving parts within that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure so if you think about delinquency john delinquency should yield higher revolve and higher late fees that flows generally immediately through the rsa the same things with chargeoffs so when they happen it goes immediately theres no lag no delay loyalty is exact same way it flows through in the period in which ph its been counted so to the extent that you see higher interest and fee yield that will flow through giving upward bias to the rsa chargeoffs will give you the downward bias and then either marketing or loyalty depending upon which program expense line comes through that will also provide immediate downward bias through the rsa john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay so its in that same period we should think about the fluctuation brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial correct the only thing that really fundamentally works more on the lag would be reserves john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay okay and then followup second question on a different topic is you had clover go into play last year you developed setpay new partners venmo verizon maybe can you comment on kind of the contribution this year of those new partners and products brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i mean a lot of really exciting growth opportunities in front of us for john you hit on a bunch of them i would say venmo and verizon are doing extraordinarily well both quantitatively and qualitatively the feedback that i get on the venmo experience is just off the charts the feedback that we get on the verizon value prop and how much youre able to save and the fact that that card is definitely acting like a top of wallet card which is exactly what we intended we couldnt be more pleased with the performance of both of those we also launched walgreens as you know its still very early there but i think weve got a great customer experience very integrated both instore online mobile et cetera and then pay in obviously its still very early but weve got a really good pipeline of partners that well be integrating this year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 in addition to individual partner integrations were also looking at broader distribution opportunities in health wellness were going to be turning this on in that in dermatology in the first quarter we think just given the ticket size there its a product that will really resonate the providers are excited about it so just a lot to focus on for the team this is definitely a year of execution i think weve got the product set that we want we made a lot of progress on distribution channels and now its just getting those products out there as much as we can so theyre available to consumers and were laserlike focused on the customer experience i mean at the end of the day thats whats winning out there and you just cant invest enough and making sure that you can make it really easy to apply for our products really easy to service and really easy to buy so thats where were focused but a lot of exciting things for operator from barclays we have mark devries please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc thank you a question for you on the credit guidance there has been a lot of investor focus on just kind of the pace and magnitude of normalization with that context just wanted to clarify when you say peak dq is expected in  that what youre referring to is just thats kind of your seasonal peak for its not your assumption of when you normalize and if thats the case how are you kind of thinking about kind of the pace and magnitude of normalization well see brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial first of all good morning mark when you talk about normalization of delinquencies that really is going to happen kind of post peak of losses and weve kind of indicated the peak of chargeoffs will be in the first quarter maybe early second quarter of so it would happen normalization happens on delinquencies after that we expect it to rise now i think you have to start out with where we start the year at and how thats going to build were at low levels we havent seen anything but it will begin to rise as we step through which again we think is going to be closely aligned with how payment rate will begin to change if payment rate remains elevated for longer period delinquencies will be slower to rise so i think thats its all going to hinge on that payment rate behavior pattern and i outlined a little bit in our prepared remarks how we see some movement in there and i think as payment rate has changed the one thing that weve started to notice in some of our cohorts is that on a unit basis we see migration back for some cohorts of accounts back to levels whats happening is that we have another cohort of accounts that have increased spending and increased payments and so on a dollar basis at the top of the house it looks like payment rate is not slowing down for certain pieces for some pieces of our portfolio it is clearly migrating back to so when that happens more in total for the portfolio youll see delinquency trends i think move with it mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 okay great and just on the pace of normalization if you think about kind of the macro assumptions that youve made about a stable to improving macro and it contained pandemic kind of how are you thinking about without economic stress how quickly delinquencies could normalize brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial well typically vintages take about months to begin to season from a delinquency perspective so again being that we started some credit refinements in the first quarter this year you would begin to see some of that flowing through in the latter part of this year so the third or fourth quarter mainly the fourth so youll begin to see that absent any changes in the macroeconomic environment just the simple fact that weve unwound certain things and begun to induce what we would call smart growth with regard to some of our clis and upgrade activities inside our dual cards and private label book operator we have time for one final question from wolfe research we have bill carcache please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc brian doubles i believe you said that even if payment rates normalize just a little bit you could see highsingle digit loan growth can you give a little bit more color on what you mean by a little bit could that be of levels and brian wenzel you said theres a scenario where loan growth could be double digit could you expand a little bit more on what that scenario looks like brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so look bill i would say we certainly dont need payment rates to come all the way back to prepandemic levels to post highsingledigit loan growth i mean a modest improvement and just a slight reversion to the mean and im not going to give you basis points here but would put us in that highsingle digits for the full year i dont know brian if you want to add anything to that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah what id say bill is our planning process this year we had multiple scenarios that we ran and we ran it on varying degrees of how the payment rate evolves so there is a scenario where the payment rate slows down quicker and in that scenario given the timing lag on purchase line you will see potentially under that scenario a higher rate of growth when it comes to loan receivables synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2022 so it really is going to hinge off of i think the important part is what is that payment rate doing and the trend of the payment rate throughout the entire portfolio as we step through which would give you the range of outcomes but again when were printing a midteens type of purchase volume growth it doesnt take a lot on the payment rate in order to impact the sequential loan growth that were seeing and brian hit on this earlier i mean we are seeing some positive developments in terms of the payment rate in terms of fewer people paying in full and so i think theres some indication that there will be some reversion to the mean in its hard to call exactly when and how much but again if you look at the purchase volume across the platforms we feel really good closing out a record year last year and as you look across all platforms we see broadbased growth in purchase volume and we did have every one of our platforms in the fourth quarter had positive receivables growth so its a pretty good setup as you look to bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yes thats really helpful thank you and i guess expanding on some of your earlier comments and sort of thinking about the interplay between that normalization in payment rates and credit are you at all concerned over the risk of credit normalizing faster than payment rates and alternatively based on what youre seeing in credit could there actually an opposite scenario where receivables growth leads credit on the normalization side brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial absolutely to the latter part we could see loan growth going faster than credit normalization it may be able to stay there more likely than not theyre going to move in sync we do not generally see a scenario where credit normalization happens and you have elevated payment rates the way we have that would be highly unusual and probably not something weve ever seen before operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you for joining you may now disconnect
