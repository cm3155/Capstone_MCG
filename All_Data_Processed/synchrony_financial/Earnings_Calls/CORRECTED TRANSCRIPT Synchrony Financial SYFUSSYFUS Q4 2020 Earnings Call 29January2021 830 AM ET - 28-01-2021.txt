active balance per account increased to just under net interest margin was down basis points to and the efficiency ratio was for the quarter net chargeoffs hit a new low at as a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to covid19 impacts on our balance sheet deposits were down billion or versus last year this includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth

of this company effective april i will transition to the role of executive chair of our board of directors and brian doubles will become synchronys president and ceo synchrony means so much to me and one of my goals as ceo was to set up a thoughtful leadership transition with a successor who will advance what we have built both the board and i believe there is no one in the world better equipped to do that than brian brian has helped to build synchrony every step of the way he has been my trusted partner for more than a decade including through our ipo when we started synchrony back in we set out to build a great business with a great culture that delivers for our partners and customers every day together with our employees we are doing just that with synchrony in a position of strength

financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 forward to working with brian through this transition and continuing to support synchronys growth and future success as executive chair with that ill turn the call over to brian brian d doubles president synchrony financial i want to start by thanking margaret for all that she has done for synchrony and for me personally over the last decade we truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership and its an absolute honor to succeed her and lead synchrony into the future im also grateful that we will continue to benefit from margarets expertise and leadership in her role as executive chair and im excited to partner with her and the board our leadership team and especially our employees as we continue to capitalize on our momentum theres a lot to be excited about as we continue synchronys journeys we have a strong business a winning culture and a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong foundation as incoming ceo i will continue to implement the strategy that weve developed over the last few years and which has enabled the momentum that our business has today we will continue to leverage our competitive strength deepen our market leadership and invest in digital data analytics and new product offerings to create a seamless customer experience we will continue to grow our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders our investors our employees our partners and our customers on that note id like to shift gears and turn to slide to talk about just one example of the strategy that we implemented to enhance the utility and value of our offerings and which has become an important part of our business today equal payment financing fundamental to our business is our objective to provide a full suite of products that can be tailored to serve the evolving needs of our customers and partners while earning appropriate economic returns our partners most critical needs are centered on their ability to offer a product that can seamlessly integrate with their digital assets and systems deliver higher average order volumes and sales increase conversion rates and deepen customer loyalty by the same token customers have their own unique set of needs including financing solutions that fit within their budgets are transparent and easy and convenient to use and which offer them flexibility in their purchase and financing decisions we have extensive experience in installment lending which has informed our approach to equal payment financing we think about these products in two categories first evolving products we offer mid and longterm equal payment plans with promotional periods anywhere from to months depending on the product category we also offer shortterm equal payment plans with promotional periods of to months second closed end products we offer collateralized installment products for bigger ticket purchases with promotional periods from to months and we also offer short and longterm installment loans through our setpay product these products run anywhere from to months synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 all of these products are priced appropriately to meet our partner and customer objectives with aprs starting at and each of these products in turn offer distinct benefits and address the unique objectives of our partners and customers evolving equal pay products for example can be embedded inside of an existing revolving account eliminating the need for a customer to open a new account and given the nature of their functionality they also provide for repeat purchases as well as higher engagement and loyalty to the partners brand meanwhile closed end products tend to appeal to customers that prefer regular predictable payments to put our overall equal payment financing strategy in perspective we currently have billion in equal payment balances of which have apr financing we have about partners or locations offering our payment plan products and we have an overall repeat purchase rate of approximately within months of the first purchase synchronys success in this and our other core strategies has been driven by our commitment to datadriven innovation a deep understanding of our partners objectives and customer needs and our ability to adapt as the competitive landscape and market conditions have evolved over time our organization is built around being nimble responsive and resultsoriented we leverage our decades of underwriting experience our proprietary data analytics and our industry expertise in order to design and implement customized solutions that address our partners needs while also delivering appropriate economic outcomes this is what has driven symphonys longstanding track record and deepened our market leadership over the years we are excited to drive this momentum forward in simply by continuing to enhance the value we offer to all those we serve and with that ill turn the call over to brian wenzel brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone before i begin i want to congratulate margaret and brian on their new roles and thank them for what they have done for synchrony and for me personally i speak for everyone in the company when i say we look forward to working closely with them in the next chapter for synchrony as we begin were encouraged by the developments being made to fight the pandemic and continue to be inspired by those in the front lines for our part we remain dedicated to keeping our employees safe and helping our partners customers and communities during this difficult period guided by our values and principles and with the partnercentric focus were working to help our constituents navigate this environment with an eye towards the future and the opportunities ahead of us as we begin to overcome the pandemic during the fourth quarter the pandemic continued to impact our growth on several areas as noted on slide however our business mix which includes a significant digital component and certain industries benefiting from staying at home such as homerelated products and services veterinary services and electronics and appliances have outbalanced against some of the effects of the economic downturn purchase volume was essentially flat down versus last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter despite some pressure from new shutdowns and restrictions as the pandemic progressed during the quarter the continued pressure caused our average active accounts to be down and decrease in loan receivables of synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 payment rates continue to be elevated relative to normalized levels interest and fees on loans were down from last year consistent with the core decrease we experienced last year dual and cobranded cards account for of our purchase volume in the fourth quarter and declined from the prior year on a loan receivable basis they accounted for of the portfolio and declined from the prior year while were seeing positive trending in our growth metric as we enter the quarter the acceleration of the pandemic resultant regional shutdowns and diminished effects of the cares act stimulus slowed that early momentum while our sales are stable were encouraged by recent developments including the recently enacted stimulus the proposed stimulus a new administration and national rollout of a vaccine we believe these factors will have a positive impact and should provide momentum as we progress through ill provide a more comprehensive view on shortly rsas increased million or from last year rsas as a percentage of average receivables was for the quarter this was elevated from the historical average primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge offs and the elimination of walmart which operate at a lowerthancompany average rsa percentage the improvement in net chargeoffs resulted in the decrease in the provision for credit losses of million or from last year this was partially offset by a reserve build in the fourth quarter of million other income decreased million mainly due to higher loyalty costs other expense decreased million or from last year due to lower purchase volume and average active accounts coupled with lower employee costs as we have begun to implement our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses moving to our platform results on slide our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to covid19 and their trajectories through this period have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix digital concentration provider access and availability of hardline goods in retail card loan receivables were down with the covid19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in digital programs that resiliency is evident in the growth in purchase volume which was up over last year other performance metrics were down due to the impact from covid19 were excited about the launch of the new value prop with sams club they are an important and valued partner and were excited about the changes in this program for sams club members the continued strength of power sports and home specialty and payment solutions helped offset some of the impact from covid19 loan receivables declined average active accounts and interest and fees on loans were down which was driven primarily by lower yield on loan receivables purchase volume decreased this quarter we signed several new programs and renewed several key partnerships this quarter we continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added over new merchants during the quarter we also continue to drive higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas our efforts and successes are expanding an already solid base for growth as we exit the pandemic although carecredit was impacted the most by covid19 earlier this year we began to see some improvement as the year progressed as providers continue to increase elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 that said rising infection rates and increasing stayathome restriction did slow some of this progress loan receivables declined with interest and fees on loans decreasing primarily driven by lower merchant discount revenue as a result of the decline in purchase volume which was down average active accounts decreased as margaret noted earlier were excited about our partner activity within this platform including the acquisition of allegro credit our aspen dental renewal and expansion and our new partnership with community veterinary partners during the quarter we also continued to grow our carecredit network and enhanced utility of our card the expansion of our network and acceptance strategy has helped to drive reuse rate to of purchase volume in the fourth quarter were proud of these achievements and particularly excited about the opportunities we see to drive future growth in this platform as the impact of the pandemic subsides ill move to slide and cover our net interest income and margin trends net interest income decreased from last year primarily driven by decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the impact of covid net interest margin was compared to last years margin of largely driven by the impact of covid19 on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates specifically the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined approximately basis points from to driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for basis points of the net interest margin decline the loan receivables yield of was down basis points versus last year and was the driver of a basis point reduction in our net interest margin the liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for basis point reduction in our net interest margin these impacts were partially offset by an basis point decrease in the total interestbearing liabilities cost to primarily due to lower benchmark rates and higher proportion of deposit funding this provides a basis point increase in our net interest margin next ill cover our key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter ill start with the delinquency trends the 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year the 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year higher payment trends have helped drive the improvement in delinquency rates focusing on net chargeoff trends the net chargeoff rate was compared to last year the reduction in the chargeoff rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trend as customer payment behavior improved throughout the allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was with the increase to last year being primarily driven by the adoption of cecl in and the impact from covid19 moving to slide ill cover expenses for the quarter overall expenses were billion for the quarter down million or from last year the decrease was driven by lower purchase volume and average active accounts as well as reduction in employee costs and operational losses the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was compared to last year the ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield which was partially offset by the reduction in employee costs and operational losses synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 moving to slide given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity while we believe its prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during this uncertain and volatile period were actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate as a result of this strategy there was a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter deposits declined billion from last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources were down billion and billion respectfully this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year the securitized and unsecured funding each comprising of our funding sources at quarterend total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets up from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in march which had two primary benefits first it delays the effects of cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio increased basis points as well to and the tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing cecl during the quarter we paid a common stock dividend of per share for the full year we returned approximately billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends as we finished and entered we have continued to assess the capital and liquidity strength of the company and the stability of our business at this point in the pandemic with this backdrop the board has authorized billion of share repurchases for beginning in the first quarter repurchases are subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions as well as overall market conditions including any potential deterioration from the ongoing pandemic next on slide we are providing a framework on key drivers for it goes without saying that current environment will have periods of uncertainty and volatility until the pandemic is under control and resulting impact to the economic environment is more fully known while our visibility is limited were providing this frame work about how we are thinking about the year might unfold based on our best assessment as of today these views assume that in the first half of the year there is continuing pressure from the pandemic and a slow economic recovery in the second half we assume the pandemic is largely under control and economic recovery accelerates first quarter purchase volumes are expected to be consistent with the trends that developed at end of second quarter comparisons will also reflect the economic trough experienced in the second quarter the second half of the year we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates regarding loan receivable growth in the first half we expect continued higher payment rates from the stimulus actions to impact loan growth in the second half of the year we believe payment rates will slow as stimulus abates and we return to more normalized payment behavior patterns combined with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 these drivers will contribute to accelerating asset growth for net interest margin overall we expect continued improvement as we enter regarding the improvement in the first half we anticipate that higher payment rates will contribute to continued excess liquidity impacting asset mix in the second half excess liquidity is reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates which drive normalized interest and fee yields leading to increasing nim with respect to our view on credit for the year delinquencies are expected to increase with peak delinquencies occurring in third quarter and result in sequential quarter increases in net chargeoffs we would expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth and the impacts from any changes in the credit macroeconomic scenario we anticipate a reserve release during as the credit macroeconomic environment develops rsas will remain elevated in the first half primarily reflecting the strong program performance including revenue and net chargeoffs in the second half we expect lower rsas generally reflecting the higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher revenue as we outlined previously weve implemented cost reductions across the organization we believe this will result in expense reductions of approximately million during the year partially offsetting these cost reductions will be expense increases relating to growth in addition to the anticipated increase in delinquent accounts we will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment and adjust as the landscape unfolds as we enter we remain optimistic in the strength and the strategic position of our business to meet the challenges and exit the pandemic period in a stronger position than when we entered we will continue to make investments in our people products technology and platforms to drive longterm value and continue to ensure safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our partners merchants providers and cardholders i will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the qa portion of our call synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 question and answer section operator and thank you we will now begin the questionand answersession operator instructions we have our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning brian d doubles a president synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc margaret first just wanted to say that its been a pleasure working with you over the last seven years ive really enjoyed the opportunity to learn from you and best of luck in your next role as executive chair margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial oh thanks so much ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe ill kick it off a question for brian wenzel so brian the rsa to loans was over in the quarter just given the betterthanexpected credit and i was wondering if maybe you can just give us a framework how to think about the rsa for if your base case that you outlined on the slide plays out can we expect it to kind of remain in this rsa to loans range before eventually dipping later in the year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great thanks ryan obviously the elevation that weve seen as we enter into was really driven by credit which was basis points better on net chargeoffs slightly offset by or offset by some of the interest expense and nim but clearly elevated so i think as you slide into what youre going to see is as we continue to expect nim to rise there will be a benefit that will flow back through the rsa to the retailers pushing it upward but then as credit normalizes that will deflate it so our expectation is it remains a little bit elevated we synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 would not expect that type of elevation at the end of the year as we exit out of and i think as you get into and beyond it should be back into the normaltype range that weve operated in prepandemic ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and brian doubles thank you for all the color on the equal payment strategy can you maybe just expand on the product offering and how you think it can evolve over time so if i look your products generally started around three months of financing so i was wondering if there was potential we could see some of these short term products evolve into your own buy now pay later product and second just given some of the new players in the space are charging merchants pretty healthy fees for these products can you maybe just talk about the pricing on merchant discount rates in some of your equal pay products and can you maybe use pricing as a lever to drive volumes towards your offering and maybe away from some of these newer entrants thanks brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah ryan thats a great question i think you really got to take a step back and say look our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products that fit both what our partners want but also what consumers are looking for and obviously buy now pay later is a trend thats not going away installment loan is a trend thats not going away if you take a step back and think about our business we have such a broad set of partners that you really just cant have a onesizefitsall strategy so as you know ryan we sit down with each one of our partners we sit down and say okay what are you trying to achieve how can we help you drive sales how can we help you communicate life cycle market to your customers and that means that they will want to offer a variety of products in some cases a revolving products going to make more sense in some cases an installment product is a better fit if you think about biggerticket products that steers more towards longerterm installment that can be on a revolving product or closed end and then smaller ticket the trend that weve seen recently is that tends to steer more shorter term and more shorter term installment and so again it comes back to really what the partner wants at the end of the day now you make a really good point obviously merchant discount pricing plays into this the shorter you go and if youre not charging interest on the account then obviously you charge a higher merchant discount and so again it comes down to what the partner wants and what the consumer wants at the end of the day look i feel great about the product set that we have the one thing that i would not underestimate though is the product is really just one piece of the equation what weve been working on and whats really important is how do you embed the product in the shopping journey and so the way that we integrate is more important than ever so it really comes down to features and capabilities even more than the products at the end of the day these products are not that complex its really about how do we integrate how do we embed the financing offer throughout the shopping journey ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color and congratulations on your promotion too i forgot to mention that earlier brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah thanks a lot ryan synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan have a good day operator and thank you we have our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks my congratulations as well to all i guess its a little weird because the credit quality being so strong is affecting you guys a little bit more because youre sharing some of the upside there with the retailers im just curious as we have the stimulus benefit like how much of the stimulus benefit is helping credit quality and do you expect it to wear off at some point did you start to see it wear off a little bit in the fourth quarter im just trying to figure out sort of how long do you think credit sort of remains this favorable at this point in time understanding your forecast that things might revert to the mean brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks sanjay so stimulus clearly has benefited weve seen that throughout most certainly we saw an influx of payments right when the most recent stimulus package hit so payment rates actually elevated back higher in the early part of january so clearly stimulus is an effect and you do see it wear off now whats interesting more interesting about this latest stimulus is its not surgical as much its going to a broadbased population so the effectiveness as we continue to move on even with further stimulus our portfolio has shifted we used to be subprime now were subprime so the effects of that will not hold so we do assume that when the stimulus burns off here most certainly from the one in december but if theres another stimulus that does get enacted in the first quarter that will burn off and youll see payment rates elevate back and then youll see delinquencies come back into the portfolio well certainly were expecting given the high level of unemployment that delinquencies will build pretty quickly here as we move out but again we havent seen that to date in the credit metrics that youve seen so there is a chance though that with the future stimulus and if you get the pandemic under control with the vaccine that you may flatten the ultimate loss curve here and have a bridge which is what we would hope for sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and maybe one for brian doubles just on and margaret the verizon and venmo cards im just curious sort of i know theyre an important part of the growth story at least over the intermediate period as were waiting for offline to recover im just curious if youre seeing progress and how theyre doing relative to your expectations margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah id say both are doing really well verizon we launched back in the summer and again it was our first launch during the pandemic i think as we started out more online and as the stores have opened up were definitely seeing real positive momentum there people are liking the value prop so we feel really positive about our verizon relationship and where that could be synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 on venmo we did the soft launch in the fall thats gone also very well and consumers are really liking how the product operates within the venmo app i think theres a lot of technology that both parties built out to make that really an integrated experience for consumers and were getting a lot of positive momentum there as we roll out to the broader population soon we expect that to continue to be a big part of our growth story as we go forward with the company so two really exciting programs two programs where technology and our investments have really paid off and we look forward to continue to advance our investments in technology as we continue to integrate even further brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah the only thing i would add to that is i wouldnt gloss over walgreens were really excited about that relationship and i put that in the same category as a venmo and verizon in terms of the opportunity for us sanjay million walgreens loyalty customers were really excited about what that relationship can do for us as well sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc absolutely great congratulation brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay have a good day operator and we have our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and congratulations both margaret and brian margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc maybe just a followup on that exact question and clearly each of these is kind of independently large customer bases and large opportunities but maybe is there a way to kind of discuss how the combination of the type of customer that has the loyalty to that particular brand and the value proposition kind of translate into a credit offering and in some way kind of thinking about the three of them and perhaps even ranking them in terms of how you see them kind of contributing to growth at synchrony synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i dont know if we could rank them yet because its still early but id say that our experience has always been that customers can compartmentalize spend so if you think about venmo i think thats going to become more of an everyday use card particularly with folks that use that app all day long and we think as its integrated into that payment mechanism and the ability to really ph split payments and actually experience that back and forth between how people spend but i think the big opportunity on venmo really is the fact that you can use that card now in broader merchants so i think as the qr code becomes more of a goto type of technology its still not where it needs to be but we think thats really the other big opportunity with venmo so you have the inapp experience where people are working together to purchase things but then instore or the qr code opportunity presents a whole different i think different set of experiences and maybe broadens that customer base for us so were excited about that on the other two it really is the value prop that i think makes another big difference where for walgreens what we do know and we know this through carecredit that people do compartmentalize their healthcare spend and as consumers are being asked to really bear a bigger burden on healthcare spend we spend we view this card to be a great way for us to enter into the broader space of healthcare you know thats been part of our strategy i should also say that its building on the relationship we already had with walgreens because we already had the card the carecredit card accepted in walgreens now this is really tying our card with their value prop connecting the two together and really allowing customers who have healthcare needs and wellness needs to really leverage that and then get the rewards and then again were going to work towards making all this digital so its a really seamless frictionless experience for the consumer and then verizon is really i think the value prop on verizon in terms of how you use verizon i think i joke all the time for those who im old so i have kids who are old theyre still on my plan you never really get the kids off the plan by the way leveraging that value prop and using that towards your bill i think is another really positive momentum that were seeing so we think all three of these programs have real growth potential i think it really demonstrates for us our ability to really be agile in a very difficult environment to roll out during the pandemic and to really meet the needs of what i would say are really strong value props leveraging technology moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks and i certainly know what you mean about the phone plan margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah ph i dont know moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc as a followup question brian wenzel given what you talked about in terms of the capital positioning how strong it is and i mean simply i mean you guys earned over billion this past year and the balance sheet shrunk and so how do you relate the billion of buyback authorization to that i mean it feels like that could get stronger over time and maybe just kind of talk about how that was developed synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks moshe so its important to note that the announcement that we made and the board authorized is slightly different than weve historically done this is for a calendar year obviously the fed has put some restrictions in for the first quarter but were going to go through our process weve been going through a quarterly process from a governance perspective looking at loss stresses looking at the way our balance sheet will perform and i think if you go back a quarter we werent sure wed be in this position to start the year we were thinking more back half of the year but i think as we talked with the board we recognized the strength in the capital and liquidity of the company we recognized the stability of the company as we progressed through the back half of as we look into again its uncertain theres going to be volatility but were optimistic that the pandemic comes under control in the first half and that the macroeconomic piece picks up so we thought it was prudent to start well go through a process and submit our formal capital plan to the fed at the end of march beginning of april and then well circle back with what that amount is we think that thats a prudent amount right given this is a transitional year right relative to the visibility and uncertainty so obviously we havent changed our long term view with regard to capital and where we want to get to its just really the pace and so were comfortable that this is a good place to start and we can always revisit as we move through the year moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thank you very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator we have our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my questions and also let me add my congratulations to both margaret and brian margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thank you mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc maybe we can wanted to start with maybe just going back to your comments on walgreens i guess my first question just really to clarify is it going to sit in carecredit or is it going to be in your retail card sector because synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 it looked like from your release it was in carecredit and then my followup on that would just be is there any implication of that because i think historically your carecredit has had no rsa or a lot lower rsa and just in terms of the program is there something we should be thinking about specific to walgreens which makes it different than a typical cobrand or retail card program margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial well ill start and then brian can talk about the rsa but look i think one of the things that we have said for a while now is that we believe that we have a unique insight into the whole healthcare wellness space given our carecredit platform weve expanded that platform all through last year as weve expanded into hospital network through just our acquisition of allegro credit we believe that consumers and by the way it does sit in carecredit so i should clarify that does sit in carecredit we believe that the everyday spend around wellness is an area where consumers are looking for rewards we believe walgreens is a great partner because we were already in there accepting the carecredit card so we believe this space is a real ripe opportunity because of our unique knowledge and experience in this space for over years and we really see walgreens as a way for us to really continue to expand and differentiate ourselves in the healthcare business i dont know brian if youd mention the rsa brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so the one thing id add on to margarets comments is when you think about the capabilities we already have a carecredit dual card that operates there and well certainly while were a big business the ability for us to really take the tools technology talent that exists in that ph manages the coband relationships inside the retail card will most certainly partner with those folks combining the healthcare knowledge of that we have in other platforms so in the payment solution platform we do have some limited rsa so you would see some rsa here but again thats a billion platform for us so i wouldnt consider it to be material most certainly in the early part here but you will see some develop over time there mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you and then just my other question was just going to be on capital and going back to some of your comments on deploying capital and getting your capital ratios closer to your peers it feel like you had excess liquidity the entire time youve been public so i guess is there an opportunity or interest in deploying some of that capital via portfolio acquisitions or through other inorganic growth whether its ma or something else that we should be thinking about or do you just feel like you have enough on your hands between walgreens venmo verizon the economy reopening that near term thats probably more what we should be focused on thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great question when we think about the capital priorities of the company the first priority for us is the organic growth that we have so when you think about some of the longerstanding existing programs whether its an amazon or paypal or tjx sams lowes theres lots of opportunity to continue our penetration march there these newer programs verizon venmo walgreens will most certainly wed like to deploy capital into that so thats our first priority to grow that piece but we will have capital beyond that ability to grow the book if you think about the capital generation of the business you think about the resiliency in the return you think about synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 the resiliency of the rsa we will have excess capital which then our next priority is to maintain our dividend and provide that back to shareholders and then beyond that we believe there will be excess that will be deployed first in share repurchase to the extent that we find an acquisition that makes sense whether it be a portfolio or businesses well look to do that margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think that was demonstrated this quarter by the acquisition of allegro so if the right opportunity comes along that fits with our longterm strategy and is at the right return for us we certainly are looking at those opportunities should they come forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial and thats the key point still in this part of the cycle im not sure valuations have checked up enough where we would do something large but to the extent that they do and opportunity exists we would gladly deploy that capital for the longterm value creation mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you for taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thank you have a great day operator we have our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brian were getting more questions around regulation and i just wanted to sort of get your perspective on how youre thinking about that risk and is there any parts of your business that could become more of a focus from mostly the cfpb et cetera margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah don ill take that im assuming this is in relation to the new administration i would say weve been around for a really long time weve had all administrations we feel confident that even in the new administration wed be able to manage through any changes that they may make i think we feel like were well positioned and look i think the regulation and the focus is really always on this whole idea of being fair and transparent to consumers and i think thats our job so we have the infrastructure in place we have the people in place were trying to ensure were doing all the right things from a consumer perspective and also working with our partners in this as well so were not overly concerned i mean look thered probably be more things coming out but well adjust as we have to synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks margaret brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don have a good day operator and thank you sir we have our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president synchrony financial good morning betsy margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc margaret its been such a pleasure working with you and i know youre still going to have like fantastic influence over at synchrony in your new role but thanks very much for all the time that youve given us over the years and brian looking forward to even working with you closer brian d doubles a president synchrony financial great thanks betsy margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you very much betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay a couple of questions on setpay just wanted to see if you could give us some color on the takeup rate at your partners and things like what percentage has it been rolled out to how much do you think you can push that in which is a period where i think youre going to see some of the pureplay guys really push hard to get synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 into merchants so wanted to get an understanding of that from you and whether or not the partners that you have today with another bnpl platform can add setpay on top of that or do you have to wait for their programs to come up for rfp in a few years just some color on that would be helpful brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah sure betsy it really does come down to the individual partner and what theyre trying to achieve and i think obviously this is a hot topic thats why we put a slide in the deck today just to kind of lay out in more detail how much of this business we actually do today i dont think its wellknown that we have billion of balances that are on equal pay products both short and long term and i think it really does come down to partner choice so as i said we sit down with each one of our partners in some cases they love the idea of an equal pay product because thats what the consumer wants thats what their customer wants but they want to put it on a revolving product and part of the reason for that is it gives them an ongoing relationship with the customer right it allows them to drive the repeat usage it allows them to do the life cycle marketing all of those things that are really important to our partners and that frankly theyve been trying to drive for the last five or six years we always talk to you about how much reuse we get on the card and thats a big priority for our partners is creating that lasting relationship with their customer and then we also have some customers that depending on their customer base and the types of products they sell that theyre actually interested in more of a shortterm closed end installment product and so were able to provide that as well through setpay and we can do that very short term we can do it longer term but it really is customized for the individual partner in terms of what theyre trying to achieve the one thing i can tell you is we are seeing slightly higher growth rates on those installment products than were seeing on the other products in the portfolio which i think is good news i mean we have to stay we absolutely have to stay ahead of that curve its rapidly evolving but the product is just one piece of the equation i touched on this earlier what our partners really want to make sure we can do and this is very different depending on the types of partners is how do we integrate into their digital point of sale and if i look across the investments that were making in the company thats one of the biggest ones so its not enough just to have the product actually having the product is the easier part in a lot of cases but how do you integrate seamlessly inside of all of our partners digital assets so how do you do that online how do you do it in their mobile app and you can imagine given the breadth of our partner base we have to have solutions that customize for each of those individual partners and so it really is more about the experience than the actual product at the end of the day does that answer your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i guess my underlying question here is do you anticipate i understand that you have a significant amount of balances on this equal pay product today setpay is a slightly different tone to that a slightly different offering and im wondering if this is in your opinion is a year where that take up by your partners is going to be explosive or is this normal course for you and we really shouldnt expect to see that much difference in how your partners interact with you on the equal pay product synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 brian d doubles a president synchrony financial i think youre definitely going to see higher growth rates in setpay than you see kind of broadly across other products with that said i wouldnt consider it explosive growth because it really comes down to what the partner is trying to achieve at the end of the day and we do have some partners that are very focused on a strategy where they like the equal pay product but theyd like to see it sit on a revolving account where they can continue to drive the repeat usage and continue to have that ongoing relationship margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial and i think the other piece is customer choice right what does the customer really want brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah and for some margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial our job is to really offer the products and position them in the right way to the consumers so that they can have consumer choice and i think one of the things were very focused on is making sure thats integrated in our digital assets so its a choice for a customer brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah at the end of the day it comes down to what our partners want and what the consumers want and again given the breadth of our partners we have to be able to provide a very full product suite revolving shortterm longterm installment and well be able to do that but it does come down to the partner and what the customer wants betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you appreciate it brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day operator we have our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 thanks good morning id like to also add my congrats to you both margaret and brian margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research you have a lot of great new programs that youre investing in as you look to the resumption of growth in new and active accounts coming out of this but can you give a bit more color on how youre gauging what the right level of investment is your guidance for operating expenses calls for higher investments but maybe you can give a little bit more context maybe in terms of an efficiency ratio brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks bill so weve continued even during the pandemic different than a lot of our peers we did not slow down any of the investments whether it was in technology or in resources weve allocated towards these growth initiatives we reprioritized certain things inside of that that were greater shortterm opportunities so weve maintained that so for us were going to continue to invest i mean was a big year for us when you think about the investment to stand up a venmo and a verizon and again were looking forward to a full venmo launch here in so weve invested quite a bit walgreens comes right behind this we continue to drive core productivity in which were continuing the investment and again the way were positioning the company for the longer term bill is to look at if im thinking out what is a aboveaverage roa and were going to drive that efficiency ratio back down into a range where its been more historically but really delivers that roa given the revenue mix and loss content that we see in that portfolio mix that being said we are going to find ways in order to either increase the margin of the portfolios or to drive incremental costs out to maintain and to perhaps expand that investment technology that is something that we want to do and we feel we need to do for the medium and long term bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thats super helpful separately on capital can you give a little bit of more color on how you guys are thinking about the cecl and cares act phaseins on your ability to return excess capital and i guess just is there a possibility that we could see you guys increase that billion authorization under a favorable macro scenario where you guys end up releasing a sizable amount of reserves as we progress through brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 yeah so let me unpack that the first piece in all our modeling as we move through and really weve always modeled in the transition adjustment relative to cecl and most certainly that would come out of we view the capital generation in those years as we move out which is roughly around i think basis points assuming that the rules stay in fact we are continuing to be honest with you engage with dialogues with our stakeholders about a form of permanent capital relief because we obviously believe that when you look at our tier plus reserves at that is very high where we are and that we believe that there should be credit whether it sits in tier or in tier relative to cecl so thats always been a factor as part of our plans and shouldnt really impact it with regard to your second part of your question that the improvement in the macroeconomic scenario most certainly were not tied to the billion thats where we view it today were going to go through our capital planning process here in the first quarter and we can get our capital plan approved by the board in march submit it in april and then hopefully well come back to you in the second quarter with a fuller perspective but there is a scenario where clearly we can return potentially more capital i think right now billion is were sitting january in a transition in a year that is a little bit uncertain is not a bad place to start the year at so were going to continue to monitor the same way quarter out we thought we werent going to do anything until the back half of this year so well continue to evaluate it bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks bill brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks bill have a good day kathryn harmon miller a senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial vanessa we have five more people in the queue but time for only one more question operator and thank you so much we have our last question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning congratulations margaret and brian and welcome kathryn brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks john margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 thanks john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc a question another question on the rsa im just wondering i mean because we can look back at historical average levels and understand it may be elevated because of the chargeoff cycle number one is is there anything different like where that maybe our average rsa should sit over time ph im not saying where it was historically it sounds like there might be some modest change because of the walmart transition but is there anything else that would change the long term kind of average rsa levels brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks john so the simple answer is no i mean walmart clearly if you strip that out will push the rsa higher because it operated at a lower rsa level than the company average absent that there is nothing fundamental i think whats challenging people and i can appreciate it from an outsidein perspective is cecl has dramatically impacted the profitability of the company and its very difficult weve lagged cecl but when you dont see delinquency formation at a retail partner its difficult to go to them and say okay even though i havent seen delinquencies theyre going to come at some point heres million million so that is unfortunately pushing the rsa higher here and then when you look at credit really outperforming the loss in nim we have a highest rsa i think when you look at it over time if you look at and combined together its going to get back down the average and most certainly as we exit the pandemic theres nothing structurally that they should operate at different level ex the walmart impact john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful thank you and my last question is and youve talked about some of the new products and i fully appreciate the customercentric focus of the new products at what point do though the kind of mix of the new products start to impact call it the economics of your business i mean for instance the closed end product might have a bigger merchant discount that would flow through a different i imagine a different line item in your pl so at what point should we envision changes in that mix and what might that like what form might that take and thanks for taking my questions brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah thanks john ill just start on that i mean look as you know we are pretty disciplined around pricing and i think we try and maintain pricing that gives us an overall and attractive return either for the program or the product that were underwriting and so that will remain consistent i think there are certainly tradeoffs and i think how you earn on these products is a little bit different obviously shorterdated promotions youre maybe getting more merchant discount youre getting less ph off of the apr to the consumer but i wouldnt see having a material impact on our overall profitability return longer term you might just see the components change which as you know both of those run through net interest income so i dont think you wouldnt see it have a significant impact there i dont know brian if youd add anything brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i mean john we have billion in assets so i think to try to move metrics materially this would have to be incredibly large i mean obviously you see growth rates in much smaller competitors but at billion it synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jan2021 shouldnt have a material effect relative to most certainly short and medium term with the way our pl is constructed brian d doubles a president synchrony financial i think the best way to think about it is these are going to be really attractive avenues for growth for us longer term this whole product strategy we do a lot more of this business than i think people realize i think we obviously were wellknown for revolving credit but we do a lot of installment its something were very comfortable underwriting were very comfortable pricing and like i said were seeing a little bit better growth there than the other products that we have so i think thats exciting at the end of the day again it comes down to partner and customer choice and were in a position to be able to provide whatever that solution is for our partners that they want john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thank you guys very much brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks john brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day
