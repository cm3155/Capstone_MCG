spend a few minutes on our recent digital and product innovation the digital transformation has been well under way for several years however the pandemic has drastically accelerated the adoption of the technology that enables the digital shopping experience particularly as it relates to the digital integration at the pointofsale and contactless payment the fact that consumers are seeking and rapidly adopting contactless solutions is creating greater demand for our partners to deliver safe and efficient shopping experiences and to provide attractive financing options at the pointofsale we are wellpositioned to address these evolving behaviors our agile approach has enabled us to support our partners as they strive to quickly meet these new demands we have continued to invest in our digital assets and capabilities quickly recognizing in the early days of the pandemic that we needed to accelerate many of our efforts to support our partners as they continue their digital transformation we have reallocated resources and agile teams to fasttrack key digital initiatives for our partners among the most critical digital innovations is one that is empowering fast and simple integration for our partners our nextgeneration native software development kit or sdk for partner integration rooted in user testing and research the new patented sypi technology offers a modern look and feel and allows our users to seamlessly apply manage pay and redeem rewards without ever leaving the partners native app further enabling ease of integration for our partners is our expansive application programming interface or api platform for full credit life cycle capabilities we offer a full suite of servicing apis with account and card management accompanied by apis powering the apply and buy experience digitally and at the pointofsale giving customers choice at the pointofsale is also critical and we continue to invest and develop in order to meet customer demand to complement our existing revolving credit offerings we have rolled out an installment product called setpay we are currently in market with multiple payment solutions partners and well be continuing to expand in to further enhance the contactless cardholder experience we are also leveraging qr code technology using this technology cards can be activated by scanning a qr code from the partners app or in the case of venmo a qr code printed on the plastic can be scanned to initiate sending a payment or to split purchases in carecredit we have customized qr codes at providers offices which directs the patient to apply for a carecredit account in the comfort of their own device we also have the ability to deliver a safe and easy way for customers to pay in store and at the pointofsale without

their own synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 smartphones the technology enables the transfer of data between the business and customers mobile devices in store for example if a customer shops in store and wants to open a line of credit the business can send the application to the customers mobile device through email or qr code the directtodevice technology was brought to market with our verizon card earlier this summer and we are working with our partners to scale this innovation across industries we are also integrating our financing offers throughout the entire digital shopping experience in todays world consumers enter websites on their own terms via a multitude of entry points and every page is essentially now a landing page content including access to credit and financing options need to be optimized to drive conversion for our partners and connect the audience to the information needed to make an educated purchase and financing decision weve had a long tradition of credit integration within the home page of our larger clients and have continued to invest in best practices for pathtopurchase site integration weve increased presence across the shopping journey with prominent placement of the financing offer on product pages the shopping cart and during the checkout process these digital solutions allow the consumer to engage in financing at the point in which they are making a purchase decision and significantly increases the sales conversion rate for our partners we are complementing these leading digital integrations with pathtopurchase data analytics and research by industry this data inclusive of heat mapping the user experience helps our clients identify where consumers are seeking information on financing and credit and has resulted in increasing conversion rates and applications we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities as they are paramount to driving digital sales penetration an increasingly important component to the success of our programs in retail card digital sales penetration was in the third quarter and digital applications were approximately of our total applications the mobile channel alone grew compared to the same quarter last year excluding walmart further more than of total payments made on our cardholders accounts are done digitally we are committed to providing partners and customers with enhanced innovative digital options from applying on their own devices provisioning the new card into their digital wallet transacting with contactless cards and making payments customers will continue to adapt to this new way of commerce and we are committed to providing the digital and product innovations to support this evolution and with that ill turn the call over to brian wenzel brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone as margaret said earlier we are determined to keep our employees safe and help our partners customers and communities succeed during this difficult time despite continued uncertainty and volatility we are grounded and guided by our values and im so proud of how our people have continually shown resilience dedication and empathy to helping those we serve as always i also want to thank those who are helping to keep us safe and healthy during this unprecedented time synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 now ill turn to our financial results for the third quarter ill start on slide of the presentation first i want to cover some of the trends we are seeing from the impact of covid19 from a purchase volume standpoint and thought it was important to provide an update on the performance of accounts that receive forbearance slide shows yearoveryear purchase volume growth for the total company and by platform dating back to january as noted in our second quarter earnings call purchase volume growth was strong for the total company and by platform with doubledigit growth in january and february leading into march as we moved through march and government restrictions increased travel entertainment and many discretionary activities were significantly curtailed and a high number of nonessential businesses were closed there was also a significant curtailment of elective healthcare services as a result purchase volume decreased significantly with april declining for the total company and looking at april by sales platform retail card declined payment solutions declined and carecredit declined carecredit was impacted the most with the significant decrease in spending for elective and planned procedures in dental and medical services during this period retail card performed better due to the higher concentration of digital volume as well as having programs that benefited from an increase in spending for essential products such as grocery supplies and homerelated expenditures as consumers became more comfortable under stayathome orders and reopening of businesses continued over the summer and into the fall we saw a recovery in purchase volume as we moved through the second and third quarters in september overall purchase volume increased over the prior year and each of the three sales platforms saw a significant recovery in purchase volumes from the april trough with retail card up carecredit up and payment solutions down only compared to a year ago looking at some of the other key business drivers for the quarter new accounts declined a significant improvement over the second quarter where new accounts declined by the decline in new accounts while improving does reflect the impact of the crisis as well as underwriting refinements we implemented purchase volume by account increased by during the quarter again a significant improvement from the decline in the second quarter there was also a increase in the average balance per account due to the combination of portfolio mix from our digital and retail partners as well as lower volume on new accounts while were encouraged by these trends theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty ahead including whether further stimulus measures will be enacted and when industrywide forbearance actions fully abate however our business mix which includes a strong digital component as well as segments that are positioned to benefit such as homerelated products and veterinary services has helped to dampen some of the effects of the economic downturn the ultimate impact is still largely uncertain given the duration and magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown at this point moving to slide we highlight the impact and performance of accounts that were granted forbearance compared to accounts not in forbearance through september we granted minimum payment forbearance to a cumulative total of approximately million accounts or a billion in account balances at the time of forbearance we have seen approximately of these accounts need forbearance through september being approximately accounts or million in account balances remaining in forbearance through midoctober these numbers have been relatively stable of the accounts that enrolled in forbearance approximately of the balances are either current or less than days past due when you look at some of the performance characteristics you will see trends that are not synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 surprising credit line utilization is higher payment rates are lower and from a credit perspective of the enrollees had a fico score of or below from a trend perspective we continue to see a substantial decline in the number of accounts enrolling in forbearance from a peak in late march to early april where we saw nearly accounts enrolling per day to approximately accounts per day in september looking at payment behavior for september of the accounts that enrolled in forbearance were making payments of the accounts paid their balance in full another were making payments leaving of the enrolled accounts not making payments and looking at performance postprogram we see a higher incident rate of accounts going delinquent than accounts that did not enter the forbearance program for accounts which were current the time they entered the forbearance program we see those accounts entering delinquency postprogram at a rate of times nonforbearance accounts for accounts which were delinquent when they entered the forbearance program we see those accounts entering delinquency postprogram at a rate of times nonforbearance accounts it should be noted that the current status of these accounts is reflected in our delinquency statistics and has not had a material impact on our 30plus delinquency measures which continued to improve during the third quarter i will cover our delinquency performance later in the presentation our intention is to cease enrolling accounts into or extending existing accounts in the forbearance program at the end of october and stand ready to provide other forms of assistance to impacted cardholders we will continue to closely monitor the performance of accounts who receive benefits from the forbearance program moving to the financial results on slide this morning we reported third quarter earnings of million or per diluted share this included a restructuring charge related to our previously announced strategic plan to evaluate our cost structure as a result of our shift in business mix and impact on the pandemic the result was a series of actions which included an exit or reduction in a number of our leased properties and certain employeerelated actions both on a voluntary and involuntary basis the charges recorded in the third quarter totaled million or million after tax and reduced eps by the increase in the provision for credit losses as a result of the implementation of cecl was million or million after tax which reduced eps by in the third quarter covid19 continued to impact our growth in several areas as noted on slide on a core basis which excludes the walmart and yamaha portfolios loan receivables were down and interest and fees on loan receivables were down on a core basis purchase volume was flat and average active accounts were down compared to last year dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the third quarter and declined from the prior year on a loan receivable basis they accounted for of the portfolio and declined from the prior year as i noted earlier the impact of covid19 moderated as we moved through the second and third quarter and specifically two of our three sales platforms saw a yearoveryear increase in september while were seeing positive trending the duration and magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown and it remains difficult to assess the stability in trends or provide a more precise forecast of the impact at this point synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 rsas decreased million or from last year rsas as a percentage of average receivables was for the quarter reflecting the seasonality we typically see in the third quarter as well as improved performance in certain elements of the sharing arrangements from some programs mainly significant improvement in net charge offs compared to last year on a yearoveryear basis the rsa percent was also impacted by the discontinuance of the walmart program last year which operated an rsa percentage below the company average the provision for credit losses increased million or from last year the increase is primarily driven by the reserve increase for the projected impact of the covid19related losses and the prior year reserve reduction related to walmart that totaled million partially offset by lower net chargeoffs the reserve build for the third quarter was million and largely due to the projected impact of covid19 related losses which i will cover in greater detail later in the presentation other income increased million mainly due to lower loyalty costs resulting from the discontinuance of the walmart program and a decline in purchase volume other expense was flat to last year with the restructuring charge and expenses related to our covid19 response being offset primarily by the cost reductions from the walmart sale also reducing other expenses was the impact from lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the quarter and reduction in certain discretionary spend moving to our platform results on slide as i noted earlier the sales platforms continued to be impacted in varying degrees due to covid in retail card core loan receivables were down with the covid19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in our digital programs other metrics were down driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio and the impact from covid19 as margaret noted earlier were excited to launch the venmo program after launching the verizon program last quarter as well as renewing and extending the key relationship with sams club this quarter the strength of powersports and payment solutions helped to offset the impact of covid19 core loan receivables declined interest and fees on loans decreased driven primarily by lower late fees purchase volume decreased and average active accounts decreased we signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter as noted on slide we continued to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added over new merchants during the quarter these networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas continue to build a solid base of business for the future although carecredit was impacted the most by covid19 earlier this year we continue to see some encouraging signs in the trends during the third quarter as providers continued to increase the degree of elective and planned services receivables declined primarily due to the negative impact of covid19 interest and fees on loans decreased primarily driven by lower merchant discount as a result in decline of purchase volume which was down average active accounts decreased as margaret noted earlier were excited to launch three new health systems during the quarter which brings the total number of health systems we currently operate in to nine we continue to expand our carecredit network and the utility of our card as we added nearly new provider locations to our network during the quarter the network expansion has helped to drive a reuse rate to for purchase volume in the third quarter synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 ill move to slide and cover our net interest income and margin trends net interest income decreased from last year primarily driven by a decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the impact of covid19 and the sale of the walmart portfolio on a core basis interest and fees on loans decreased the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of largely driven by the impact of covid19 on loan receivables an increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates specifically the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined approximately basis points from to driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for basis points of a net interest margin decline a basis point decline in loan receivable yield primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of walmart portfolio the impact from lower prime rate movements accounted for approximately basis points of the decline the remaining reduction of approximately basis points in loan receivable yield is primarily attributable to higher payment rates resulting in lower revolve rate and lower late fee incidents the total reduction in loan receivable yield accounted for basis points of the reduction in our net interest margin the investment securities yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rate and accounted for basis points on net interest margin decline these impacts were partially offset by an basis point decrease in total interest bearing liabilities cost to primarily due to the lower benchmark rate and lower deposit pricing this provided a basis point benefit to our net interest margin excluding the main impacts that covid19 has had on our net interest margin the decrease in loan receivables and the increase in liquidity the net interest margin will be trending closer to next ill cover our key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter ill start with the delinquency trends the 30plus days delinquency rate was compared to last year the 90plus days delinquency rate was compared to last year higher payment trends are helping drive the improvement in the delinquency rates focusing on the chargeoff trends the net chargeoff rate was compared to last year the reduction in net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by the walmart sale and improving credit trends excluding the impact of the walmart portfolio net chargeoff rate was approximately basis points lower than last year the allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was postcecl implementation excluding the effects of cecl the allowance under the alll method would have been the reserve build in the third quarter was million under cecl and million under the alll method the overall reserve provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of covid19 which accounted for most of the reserve build in the third quarter more specifically our reserve build was driven by two main factors first an increase in the provision for accounts that received forbearance benefits second a projected diminished effect from stimulus in summary the third quarter credit trends continue to be strong and better than our expectations with forbearance providing a degree of benefit in delinquency trends we do expect overall credit trends will be impacted by covid19 as we move forward moving to slide ill cover expenses for the quarter overall expenses were flat to last year totaling billion for the quarter the restructuring charge and expenses related to our covid19 response were offset primarily by the cost reductions from the walmart sale the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 efficiency ratio for the third quarter was versus last year the ratio was negatively impacted by the restructuring charge and expenses related to our response to covid19 excluding those impacts the efficiency ratio would have been basis points lower or approximately for the quarter excluding the impact of the restructuring charge and the covid19related expenses the increase in ratio was mainly driven by the decrease in revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield moving to slide given the reduction of our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform we continued to carry a higher level of liquidity during the third quarter while we think it is prudent to have higher liquidity levels given the level of uncertainty and volatility we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity as a result of this strategy there was a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter our deposits declined by nearly billion from last year we also reduced the size of our securitized and unsecured funding sources by billion and billion respectively this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with securitized and unsecured funding each comprising of our funding sources at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets this is up from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in march which has two primary benefits first it delays the effect of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second allows for a portion of the current period provisioning under cecl to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year reflecting the preferred stock issuance last november the total capital ratio increased basis points as well to also reflecting the preferred issuance and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing cecl and the preferred stock issuance during the quarter we paid a common stock dividend of per share earlier this year we announced that given the current economic uncertainty and being as prudent as possible we made the decision to halt further share repurchases until we have greater visibility on the magnitude and the impact covid19 will ultimately have in the economic environment we will continue to evaluate this as we move forward overall we continue to execute on the strategy we outlined previously we are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and operate with strong capital and liquidity levels in closing given the number of uncertainties that continue to exist regarding the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and the countering impacts that stimulus has had and could have going forward it remains difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time and provide specifics around key outlook drivers as i did last quarter i want to provide a framework to help consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers regarding loan receivables growth covid19 has had an impact on purchase volume but weve seen positive trending and improvement in purchase volume as long as the pandemic does not worsen and businesses remain open we expect this trend to continue or to be stable synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 what continues to help our trends and resiliency is growth in digital diversity inside our platforms and financing in essential areas such as home and healthcare we will continue leveraging our capabilities and expertise to help our partners and providers during this difficult period this overall direction in purchase volume will be a key influence in our receivables growth rate weve also seen higher payment trends which has also impacted our loan receivables growth this also favorably impacts credit trends as evidenced in our lower delinquency rates and net chargeoffs the offset to this is lower revolve and fees or nonaccounts negatively impacting loan receivable yields and the net interest margin when the effects of stimulus and industrywide forbearance program subside and delinquencies begin to increase we expect payment rates to decline and then provide a positive impact to loan receivable growth our net interest margin has also been impacted by a number of other factors including a higher level of liquidity and a reduction in the size and yield from the receivables due to lower benchmark rates lower revolving fees and the impact of forbearance as we move forward we will continue to look for ways to deploy a higher level of liquidity and the impact of forbearance should it be should the current trends continue we do believe the net interest margin has stabilized and should improve prospectively as i indicated earlier we do expect the payment rate to decline and believe the revolve rate will increase as well as fees which will also be a benefit to the net interest margin regarding rsas we expect an impact from higher credit costs in the future while some programs are benefiting from lower net chargeoff levels currently we expect net chargeoff levels to increase and impact the flow through of the rsas the ultimate amount of credit cost impact and timing will be determined somewhat by the expected deterioration in credit as stimulus actions and industrywide forbearance assistance abates while we expect the net chargeoff rate to increase in the nearterm it should be noted that overall portfolio quality and credit trends as we entered into this pandemic were strong and continue to improve throughout the year into the third quarter also the tools and capabilities we have highlighted previously will help us better navigate the economic impacts from covid19 as we move forward reserve bills may be somewhat elevated in comparison to the outlook weve provided in january when taking into account seasonality until we gain more visibility into the duration and severity of the current pandemic we cannot provide more specific guidance regarding the efficiency ratio activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we will mitigate some of this impact through the recently announced strategic plan to reduce our operating expenses we expect the cost savings from this plan to be in the million to million range for as the plan is executed we expect the cost save run rate to increase throughout beyond we expect to see even higher cost saves from this plan in closing the business remains fundamentally strong and resilient and were going through the situation with a strong balance sheet capital and liquidity position with that ill turn the call back over to margaret synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 margaret m keane chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian ill provide a quick wrapup and then well open the call for qa clearly the coronavirus pandemic has meaningfully impacted our business in several ways including key areas such as purchase volume and loan receivables as we have said the ultimate impact from this crisis remains difficult to quantify right now so what i can tell you is that our ability to rapidly adapt to the evolving environment positions us well we are confident in the fundamental resilience of our company and our ability to manage through this cycle just as we have managed through other cycles for nearly years our partnercentric business model and agile approach to our operations and investments are enabling the rapid deployment of innovative solutions to support our partners and cardholders we remain focused on execution today with an eye towards the future making investments building capabilities launching programs and making the fundamental changes necessary to emerge from this pandemic in a stronger position thank you for participating on the call today and i hope you and your families stay healthy and safe ill now turn the call back to greg to open up to qa greg wade ketron senior vice president managing directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our comments on the quarter we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you and well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and from jefferies we have john hecht please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys thanks very much just related to the provision expense it seems like well i guess the question is is this more of a general increase in the allowance tied to just general uncertainty or is it more of a precise provision tied to certain elements youre seeing in the deferral program brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning john so the provision the way to think about the provision for the quarter is when you look at the macroeconomic environment when you look at growth when you look at our kind of precision that all netted out to roughly flat to a small provision when we looked at two specific elements as we closed the quarter one being the forbearance accounts that have come off program given the delinquency rate they had when we evaluate those accounts we thought there needed to be a higher provision associated with those particular accounts beyond what was included in the base reserve so there was an incremental call it million to million associated with those accounts that are in delinquency today that were in the forbearance program or are current today that may roll into forbearance and the residual piece really went to our view on the stimulus and the fact that our view the timing of the stimulus as well as the efficacy of the stimulus would be delayed so theres an incremental provision of roughly million associated with the stimulus delay john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks for the detail and then the setpay product thats consistent with that of the consumer demand were seeing now in the marketplace maybe if you could just give us a sense of the growth potential growth trajectory of that product and then will the call it the economics meaning the yield and the anticipated losses and so forth be consistent with the overall credit program margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john thanks for the question id say two things one we wanted to address the market we already had installmentlike products out there which meet our return hurdles so we are being very thoughtful and cognizant and looking at how these products work but i would tell you that what were looking to do really with setpay is to offer the customer a choice between our different product set and hopefully do this in a way thats online so as the customer is making the purchase particularly a big purchase they have the opportunity to do the setpay product and were looking to do that in light of our overall portfolio with returns that we have in the business today so were not looking to minimize or reduce our returns because of that product synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 look i think everyones looking at these products as a big part of the market theres lots of sales out there these products are still a really small subset of the market but i do think we felt competitively it was important to really position ourselves to have that product for consumers but i dont think down the road youre going to see this as a big part of who we are but another product to really help our partners grow their business brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial well and john thanks very much the reason for that is i think a lot of our partners while they want to offer this product to margarets point and have choice for the consumer weve spent a lot of time working with our partners to get reused on the card and brian talked about that earlier and so we have some partners who say look i want to offer a revolving product to get that second and third purchase and thats been something weve been working on for well over five years now and theyre not as enamored with the oneanddone product but look at the end of the day we want to be able to offer choice at the point of sale john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah makes sense thank you guys very much margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator from credit suisse we have moshe orenbuch please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks maybe just a followup on that reserving question brian so as we think about it going forward should we think that the reserve would be at a comparable percentage if theres no kind of macroeconomic changes are there other things kind of as we go into the fourth quarter and into to consider in terms of that reserve build or decrease brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning moshe so the way i would think about it is we feel that were adequately reserved at the end of september for both the forbearance accounts specifically but the overall portfolio assuming macroeconomic trends dont move significantly and to be honest with you to make sure that pandemic stays in check with where it is today the real impact to reserves will be growth in the portfolios any shifts in the portfolio we see between the platforms moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 got it thanks and i thought from the standpoint of kind of new account generation you said the number of new accounts was down from a little over million to just a little over million maybe as you kind of think about the various factors there obviously where we are in the economy the two launches that youve got and all of the initiatives can you talk a little bit about that metric what thats going to look like in the fourth quarter and into and does that mean for the growth that ph everyone wanted to see margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks moshe its margaret id say two things one i would say in september we did start seeing store traffic start really coming back at a bigger pace we still originate a lot of accounts in store so having that instore traffic come back i think is going to be very helpful i think as we continue to market our new programs well see positive trend there i think the real question mark is really how this holiday will play out right now our view is consumers are saying they want to shop and they want to do something fun and be out there so i think holidays going to play into this as well and then the only maybe negative or downside to that would be we do tighten credit during this period so we are being careful there we dont want to just open up the faucet if you will to new accounts so were really being soft on capital on how were underwriting but i think the trends we started seeing in september with more store traffic should help our new account volume as we go into the fourth quarter moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and just anything about the new programs impact ph on that either in the third quarter or march margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial well yeah i mean i would say verizon is tracking very well they were slower to open stores so were just starting to see store traffic from them they were more online but were really seeing that pick up and were really pleased with how verizon is playing out venmo on the other hand is still in a softer launch so were really still testing and piloting that product but again the results so far have been extremely positive if you havent applied for the card or i guess you cant apply you got to get off it but for those whove gotten off the card weve gotten really really positive feedback in terms of the value prop how the card works how easy it is to activate how easy it is to purchase with it so we anticipate the venmo product to be a big part of our growth story as we go into brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way id frame it for the quarter moshe the fourth quarter both verizon and venmo wont have a large impact its really be more into as you progress into and margarets point really about stores opening up the biggest wildcard with regard to new accounts in the fourth quarter will ultimately be the channels right we see some differences in new accounts per your digital channels versus your instore so that could be a very favorable trend for us we hope in the fourth quarter moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator from bank of america we have mihir bhatia please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks for taking my questions and good morning i just wanted to start with maybe could you just give us your cecl assumptions just on gdp unemployment assumptions this year and maybe exiting next year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure good morning so the baseline measure that we used which is really coming off of the moodys august baseline metric which has unemployment at that point being at the end of this year in and in and as weve gone through and done our modeling off of that the way in which we interpret it we actually have redistributed that unemployment curve so effectively the unemployment we have at the end of the year is down from the second quarter in up slightly from our previous estimate and in so we have a little bit slower recovery back into as we think things have pushed out which partially as we talked about some of the stimulus and other metrics and then the gdp assumptions we have in line with the moodys the baseline model to be honest with you which had a linked quarter decline in the third and in the fourth mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thank you and then i wanted to maybe just go back to the discussion on i think buy now pay later the installment product and i wanted to ask about the impact on the retail card business i understand that its a small part of the market right now overall but were starting to see it at more and more retailers and just as an example paypal one of your partners launched pay in and it shows up right alongside paypal credit on the checkout screen so it seems like theres at least some cannibalization risk now i understand pay in is new but some of the other bnpl products have been around for a while so i was curious how are you viewing those products and have you seen any impact from those products on the retail card platform that you already have thank you margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial id say no weve not really seen a big impact on our portfolio or with our partners i think that is why we have setpay out there and i do think having customer choice is going to be the thing that we want to really do we want to do that mobilely as well so that customers when theyre in the shopping cart can make a choice in terms of paypal we know that we have a great partnership with paypal they had a product that they had already launched in the uk and wanted to accelerate their launch here in the us we see that as a crosssell opportunity for us like brian said earlier so again we feel like were positioning ourselves in the marketplace to synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 be as successful were not at this point really seeing a huge impact of these products against our overall performance mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks have a good day operator from jpmorgan we have rick shane please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks for taking my questions this morning im curious to how the change in the way that consumers are interacting with businesses fits with your business model and when i think about that historically you guys probably had a higher percentage of instore cardpresent transactions as you move to your mobile app you went to a highly secured tokenized transaction and now you probably have many more customers shopping online card not present the business model has historically had lower interchange and so im wondering from an economic perspective is there greater fraud risk and is there a way within the business model to offset that economically margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah well i think its important to note most of our transactions are private label transactions which dont charge interchange so for us thats not an issue i think whats really important for us is ensuring from a fraud perspective that we have the right customer applying weve put a number of tools in place to really drive fraud and make sure were offering the customer the right product to that right customer i would say generally speaking fraud is something that we continually battle every financial institution is up against this battle particularly as more and more people have been compromised in terms of their identities and really its our responsibility to really put the tools in place to make sure that were doing the best job possible to reduce that fraud i dont know brian if youd add brian doubles if youd add anything on transaction volumes brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah the only thing i would add rick and weve talked about this in previous calls is this is where were really leveraging data share with our partners our partners know quite a bit about their customers they know how long theyve been a customer either through a mobile or digital channel even simple things like if we can match the ship to address with the address that theyre putting into the apply tool to apply for a credit line those things are enormously helpful in helping us authenticate the customer and reducing fraud rate so thats something that we rolled out across all of our large partners in retail card and were rolling it out now to even synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 some of the smaller partners to share that data in an effort to reduce fraud but also make better credit decisions around line sizes and get a better credit outcome as well richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and margaret thats exactly my point which is with no interchange on the traditional transaction what i was sort of trying to understand and it sounds like youre managing it more on the fraud side trying to determine if theres some way on the cardnotpresent transactions over the online whether or not you can capture some additional economics margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial i got that sorry about that but yes exactly what brian was describing richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick have a good day operator from morgan stanley we have betsy graseck please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i like to call it the finger traffic versus the foot traffic and i know in the prior question you answered it from a foot traffic point of view but i just wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about the finger traffic in terms of generating that new account and then how have you seen that finger traffic change over the course of the pandemic have you seen any behavior change in terms of frequency of purchase average size of purchase just line utilization that people are willing to maintain especially in the latter more recent couple of months i should say just wondering if the behavior is changing at all margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 well brian touched on this a little bit and ill have brian doubles add a little color to this but of our applications for retail card were generated mobilely or online so that is a big shift from where we were and each quarter its been growing our view is that that will continue to grow in addition to which consumers are using our apps to make payments increased credit lines and really transact through their mobile phone we expect that to continue to grow and be a big part of what were working on with our partners i would say that what were always trying to do is create this digital pointofsale both in the retail card payment solutions and carecredit business so its not just the retail card side its actually all three platforms and back in march we really pivoted our agile teams to really accelerate some of the development on the mobile side so i would say i dont think were seeing a difference in terms of spend or how they spend i think the reality is that people dont necessarily always want to go into the store so online has become a bigger part of how they transact and id say the second is just as we move forward the whole contactless even instore purchasing i think will become a bigger part because consumers really dont want to touch pointofsales so those are the areas that we continue to invest in i dont know brian doubles if youd add brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah one of the things i would add betsy is one of the things weve been very focused on and actually one of the areas that we accelerated back in march is really integrating our financing offers throughout that customer shopping journey and we showed you a little bit of that on the slide and that looks very different by partner so if you think about sypi or sdk that plugs into the larger partners apps that weve been doing for a number of years now and that works really well with large partners so either the sypi product or having the larger partners plug right into our api platform which is what were doing on venmo the work that we accelerated back in march and april which really matters more to our smaller to midsized partners is really getting integrated into their digital properties across the pointofsale so not just when youre checking out in the shopping cart but when youre looking at the product when you enter the home page and weve seen conversion rates go up significantly when we have that kind of multipoint integration across all of their digital properties and so thats really what weve been focused on is helping not just our large partners but small to midsized partners getting the financing offer presented multiple places throughout that shopping journey and again thats been really important to our partners because obviously times like these theyre accelerating their digital transformation and trying to drive sales and this certainly helps them do that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and how penetrated do you feel you are with your current customer set in that offering brian d doubles a president synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 well it really varies id say were very penetrated in the larger partners and were making really good progress in the small to midsized partners but a lot of this is its really a joint partnership it depends on their level of how far advanced they are in their digital transformation and were building tools to easily plug in there in a scalable way betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then my followup just is on liquidity you highlighted in the deck that the liquidity is up significantly yearon year makes sense wondering how much of that will you sit on to fund future loan growth or will you be redeploying that into securities theres clearly excess capital that could drive buybacks as well going forward so im just wondering how youre thinking about this excess liquidity that youve got brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yes thanks betsy as we think about as we enter the fourth quarter its really to fund the portfolio growth that we would seasonally anticipate as we move into we hope it funds loan growth we said earlier with regard to buybacks obviously we like to have the cash to and we most certainly have the capital to execute the buybacks but really thats not on our horizon until probably at least the back half of the year when we have a better view of what the economy is going to do so our plan really is to deploy it relative to growth in the assets and managing the liability side of the equation i dont anticipate us really going to try to chase some basis points of yield in the investment portfolio to be honest with you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day operator from wolfe research we have bill carcache please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning everyone margaret there was a period postwalmart where you guys eliminated concerns over renewal risk by pushing the earliest renewal date to which seemed really far away at the time but now with getting closer and rfps happening in some cases roughly a year ahead of contractual maturity dates some investors have started to ask whether we could see you guys do something similar to what you did postwalmart by possibly renewing your largest partnerships and sort of eliminating that renewal risk for several years into the future can you discuss whether thats something that youre considering or are we more likely to see renewals happen on more of a casebycase basis margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial look were always trying to renew deals so i think this is really the relationship and partnership that weve built over the years and i think you just saw it happen with sams club we renewed sams club with a multiyear deal synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 last year and we just renewed it again with another multiyear deal so were always looking at ways to extend our partnerships and usually that conversation comes about as people are thinking about new value props or big investments into the program in some way and i would just tell you the way i think about renewals thats like a daily part of our jobs and we need to make sure that were having those conversations where it makes sense so you see it happening real time with what happened with sams club brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i think the one thing id add on to margarets point is that when you look at these investments so in the case of sams theres a value prop construct on top of the renewal we did last year and we priced at a very disciplined level right we priced through the cycle and priced through a very difficult cycle here so to the extent that we get an opportunity to extend at a attractive riskreturn profile we most certainly would take that opportunity and take that risk off the table bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you thats very helpful if i can as a followup when we look at the levels of capital that you guys are running at and the amount of building that youve done to the extent that there potentially could be some sort of stimulus that it seems like youre not really counting on that as a big benefit in the reserve building that youve done to date historically you guys have expressed your belief that you could run at capital levels comparable to your peers which we see at sort of the range on a normalized basis is it reasonable to think that you guys can get cet1 down to that range as we look ahead to kind of the other side of this brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah yeah bill so first of all let me just make sure were clear on stimulus we still have stimulus baked into our reserves its just at a lower level and the timing is different than what you would see in a base moodys model which i think last week they may have even moved out to their stimulus but we havent spent a lot of time with it so there is some level of stimulus with regard to the capital level yeah nothing has changed in our view with regard to how we think about the longterm capital position and being able to get down to our peers during this period of time we continue to run stress cases and are very comfortable with our ability given the resiliency of the business given the earnings profile of the business the rsas that we can get down to that level so theres no change with regard to the long term view on capital the timing which we begin to deploy greater amounts of capital back to the shareholders will really be dependent upon the economy and the visibility bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it very helpful thanks for taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 thank you margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you have a great day operator from stephens we have vincent caintic please go ahead vincent caintic q analyst stephens inc hey thanks for taking my questions first on your expenses so its helpful to get your guidance for million to million for and more beyond that and also just thinking about your push on digital here im sort of wondering if you can sort of talk about your digital investments and it seems like youre pushing more than usual to accelerate your partners digital transformation is this sort of the level we should expect in terms of investments going forward do you want to make more investments or does this taper off after a little bit of time thank you margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial well weve been making investments for a number of years particularly in our technology platform and well continue to do that as we see the need we think that strategically we have to be the best of the business in terms of digital capability and i think both in the front end which weve talked a lot about but even on the back end and so when we looked at kind of pivoting back in march we actually stopped doing some things that didnt really make sense given the pandemic and redeployed those resources to accelerate some of the things that were already on our road map so it wasnt like we created new thinking we actually had these plans they were just further out an example i would give you is were doing a lot of work on digital collections right now in terms of really getting us to be stateoftheart there so thats an example where we took resources that were kind of working on that but we put more resources on it id say that from an expense point of view we took a really comprehensive look at our overall expenses and said okay how do we tighten where do we tighten some of that we talked about in terms of our footprint which was a positive one but when we did this journey on expenses we basically said were going to do this expense reduction in order to ensure we can still invest for the future because i think sometimes the mistake you make is you tighten so much that you really dilute the future and what we didnt want to do is really have that happen so weve been hard at work making sure we continue to invest while tightening where we can so thats really the plan that weve kind of executed upon we have work to do going into but we feel like we were able to pivot pretty quickly and really align our cost base to the size of our business going forward to ensure that we keep the returns that we want to achieve for our shareholders so were feeling weve executed well here we still have things to do of course but were well into the execution of the expenses coming out vincent caintic q analyst stephens inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 okay thats very helpful thank you and just with the excess deposits that you were talking about just wondering how much more aggressive youre willing to get on raised cuts or do you feel comfortable here thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question so well continue to evaluate that market we led the market down this year so weve reduced basis points on our high yield savings basis points on cds with six and seven movements as we think macroeconomically going forward there will be some pressure as wed have some higher priced cds coming up for expiration as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter so there will be some pressure to redeploy those dollars for our consumers we also think theres an opportunity as we think some of the larger institutions may continue to try to reduce rates so there may be some inflows but at the end of the day we hope to grow the business next year and well need those deposits so its a very tricky balance we can move down a little bit more we think but we want to be very cautious because what we dont want to do is if we have to raise deposits next year have to then pay more in price in order to get those deposits so its really a fine balance between trying to find that appropriate floor and were in line with competition there could be a little bit more room but i wouldnt expect something significant greg wade ketron a senior vice president managing directorinvestor relations synchrony financial brandon we have time for one more question brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks vincent operator yes from kbw we have sanjay sakhrani please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but just on the sams club renewal congratulations on that i know its been a whirlwind of the last couple of years im just curious how should we think about the economic impacts of the renewal are there any appreciable impacts on the rsas going forward and any others that we need to contemplate margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial we always look at this in terms of the returns and were pretty happy with where we landed on the renewal in terms of our raw returns so i wouldnt see a big economic impact i think the real positive here is that weve been able to work closely with sams over the last say to months on really helping them execute against their digital strategy and well continue to do that and i think more importantly the exciting part is really relaunching a new value prop which both of us felt was really needed so were excited to work with them on that as we go into but i dont think youll see an appreciable difference in the economics synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then i guess i have a followup on the buy now pay later industry questions and maybe its a question for you margaret and brian doubles if we think about the industrys impact thus far do you feel like its had an appreciable impact in terms of loan growth do you feel like its cannibalizing your customers across all your relationships or is it just a different customer base thats sort of where youre seeing the uptake in this product thanks margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial well i think first of all lets put it in perspective i think the overall dollar sales on those products somewhere between billion and billion which is really not that appreciable when you look at the overall market most of whats being put out there are smaller ticket for paymenttype things for retailers i think where we really have a market andor have a solid customer base is really on the bigger ticket size and thats where i think weve been able to do things like were doing with amazon so our view is were going to be in this market were going to look at the right way to do this the other thing id tell you its still early days on the overall economic returns on these particular smaller ticket ones but setpay is a product that were testing and piling were having good success i think its really about two things giving customer choice and then second helping the merchants complete the sale because right now the most important thing for our merchants and our partners is to help them grow theirselves which is what were really trying to work on i dont know brian doubles if youd add anything there brian d doubles a president synchrony financial no i think it does it comes down to choice and our partners all have a view on which products that they want to offer in some cases its a revolving credit product that has an installment component could be setpay in some cases if its smaller ticket to margarets point they would be more interested in the buy now pay later product our goal at the end of the day is to be very integrated across all of our partners digital properties and offer a wide range of financing products because it wont be a onesizefitsall its going to be a combination of revolving credit longerterm installment and shorterterm buy now pay later products sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks sanjay brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thanks sanjay synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 greg wade ketron senior vice president
