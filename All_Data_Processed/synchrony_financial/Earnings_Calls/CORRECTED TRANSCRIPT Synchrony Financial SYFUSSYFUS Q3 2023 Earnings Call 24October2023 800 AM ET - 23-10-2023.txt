choice for retailers merchants and providers alike as they seek enhanced value greater utility and bestinclass experiences synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 we opened million new accounts in the third quarter and grew average active accounts by we continue to drive growth with our billion of purchase volume representing a record third quarter and a increase versus the prior year this momentum is a testament to the power of our diversified portfolio health wellness purchase volume grew compared to last year reflecting broadbased growth in active accounts led by dental pet and cosmetic the growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts as several of our newer programs continue to resonate with consumers in diversified value purchase volume grew reflecting growth in outofpartner spend and strong retailer performance lifestyle purchase volume increased reflecting growth in average transaction values and outdoor luxury and in home auto purchase volume remained flat versus last year as growth in commercial products home specialty and the auto network was generally offset by lower retail traffic in furniture and electronics and the impact of lower gas and lumber prices dual and cobranded cards accounted for of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased as several of our newer value propositions continue to drive greater customer engagement synchronys range of products and platforms gives us a unique view into the health of the consumer through our monitoring we see continued trends of behavior normalizing to prepandemic levels across the portfolio average transaction values leveled off through the quarter after modestly declining in the second quarter meanwhile average transaction frequency which had climbed throughout the year showed some signs of stabilization toward the end of the quarter looking at our outofpartner spend our customers are becoming more selective in making larger purchases including home furnishings and electronics and spending less on travel directionally we see broad trends that are in line with our expectations across the portfolio with slowing spend growth normalization of payment rates and growth in balances which is driving higher net interest income while in the external deposit data we track consumer savings balances remain approximately above the average level in in summary these trends show a consumer that continues to benefit from a strong labor market while reverting gradually toward historical spend and payment norms as we closely monitor the health of the consumer we also continue to develop and deploy the compelling products and value propositions that attract consumers and partners to synchrony we announced earlier this month that both the paypal and venmo cards can now be provisioned in the ph app or wallet representing our latest enhancement as we evolve to meet the demands of our increasingly digital first customers synchronys journey began with instore financing options which have long been valued tools for both retailers and consumers to build loyalty and drive value over time weve broadened the utility of these products through our dual and cobrand card strategies which enable customers to make outofpartner purchases accumulate rewards and extract even greater value and increasingly our customers are taking that engagement even further as digital wallets enable everyday use functionality and extend our leading value propositions well beyond the store synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 active wallet users are up over yeartodate and sales on wallets are up over this trend is more than a simple technological enhancement synchronys strategy to deliver enhanced utility and bestinclass experiences requires seamlessly integrated tailored solutions and our investments in technology allow us to meet this demand when our customers combine the broad utility of our products and services with our digital wallet functionality the impact is clear our digital wallet users spend nearly twice as much and have over double the transactions on

solution suite and extend the reach of our products meeting consumer demand for fast and secure shopping and opening new opportunities for customers to engage with their favorite brands in health wellness we were pleased to announce partnerships with veterinary hospitals at three additional universities carecredit is now accepted at of the nations public veterinary university hospitals in

focus on technological innovation continues to position synchrony as the partner of choice as we deliver digitally powered experiences and compelling value for our many stakeholders and with that ill turn the call over to brian brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys third quarter results reflected the strength of our financial model demonstrated through our consistent growth and strong riskadjusted returns the compelling value propositions of our broad product suite continue to resonate with our 70plus million customers and drove broadbased growth across our sales platforms ending loan receivables grew versus last year benefiting from the combination of approximately basis point decrease in payment rate versus last year and growth in purchase volume our third quarter payment rate was still remains approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear prepandemic historical average net interest income increased to billion reflecting growth in interest and fees the increase in interest and fees was due to the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates as well as lower payment rate our net interest margin was declined basis points compared to the prior year as higher funding costs more than offset the benefit of higher yields and favorable asset mix specifically loan receivable yield grew basis points and contributed basis points to net interest margin higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional basis points to net interest margin and our mix of interestearning assets improved net interest margin by approximately basis points reflecting our strong growth in loan receivables but these gains were more than offset by higher interestbearing liability costs which increased basis points to and reduced net interest margin by basis points synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 rsas of million in the third quarter were of average loan receivables a million decline from the prior year reflecting higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income our rsas continue to perform as designed they provide a critical alignment with our partners as we navigate the evolving environment together and support greater stability in our returns provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables other expenses grew to billion primarily driven by the growthrelated items as well as technology investments and operational losses our efficiency ratio for the third quarter improved by approximately basis points compared to last year to summarizing our financial results synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide our delinquency performance in the third quarter continued to reflect normalization towards prepandemic behavior with both the 30plus and 90plus delinquency rates approaching levels our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and approximately basis points lower than the third quarter of our 90plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year and approximately basis point lower than our third quarter of our net chargeoff rate was versus last year synchrony remains approximately basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of to where our risk adjusted returns are more fully optimized overall our credit performance remains within our expectations and has benefited from investments in our advanced underwriting platform as we expect to continue on a path towards our longterm operating targets focusing on our more recent vintages they continue to perform in line with those from while we are pleased with how these vintages are developing we are continuously monitoring our portfolio and have implemented further credit actions including some tightening of our origination criteria these proactive refinements are intended to position our business for and beyond moving to reserves our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was up basis points from in the second quarter the reserve build of million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth turning to slide our stable funding model and strong management of capital and liquidity continue to position synchrony well for any environment in the third quarter customers continued to be attracted to our consumer bank offerings as we grew both direct and brokered deposits to fund our anticipated receivables growth deposits represented of our total funding at quarter end the remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at and of our funding respectively we completed a billion securitized issuance in the quarter and will continue to be active in both markets as conditions allow total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion up million from last year at quarter end liquidity represented of total assets down basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 moving on to our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony made its annual transition adjustment of approximately basis points in january and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately basis points each year until january of the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet under the cecl transition rules we entered the third quarter with a cet1 ratio of basis points lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year during the third quarter we returned million to our shareholders consisting of million of share purchases and million of common stock dividends and at the end of the quarter we had million remaining in our share with purchase authorization synchrony remains wellpositioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan we will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow now please refer to slide of the presentation for more detail on our outlook for we expect our ending loan receivables to grow approximately versus last year reflecting the combined impact of payment rate moderation and slowing purchase volume growth we expect a full year net interest margin of approximately net interest margin in the third quarter benefited from strong growth in interest and fees and receivables in addition to payment rate moderation and lower deposit betas in the fourth quarter we expect net interest margin to be impacted by higher average liquidity to prefund seasonal loan receivables growth impacting the mix of interest earning assets higher deposit betas driven by competition and movement in benchmark rates and interest and fee growth partially offset by rising reversals from a credit standpoint delinquency nearly reached levels at quarter end and should follow seasonal trends from this point with the increased visibility into delinquency performance this year we are tightening our forecasted net chargeoff rate to approximately we continue to anticipate our loss rate reaching a fully normalized level between and on an annual basis in and as we noted we will continue to monitor and position the portfolio for and beyond we expect the rsa to trend at the low end of our prior outlook and be approximately of average loan receivables for the full year this improved outlook reflects the impacts of the continued credit normalization lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth and as we generate higherthananticipated growth we are maintaining our expectation for operating expenses at approximately billion per quarter while we continue to make selective investments in our business we are committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year as synchrony continues to leverage our core strengths our advanced data analytics our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management and our stable funding model we are confident in our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver marketleading returns over the long term ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call

continued ability to drive longterm value into the future and with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session this concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions we will take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe a twopart question on credit first the full year guide implies a decent acceleration in charge ph off performance in the fourth quarter so you can maybe just talk a little bit about whats driving that and then second maybe just tease out what gives you confidence that were going to follow seasonal patterns from here given a handful of moving pieces inflation resumption of student loan payments and then obviously we have the growth ph math impacts from and but offsetting that you guys obviously were one of the more conservative in underwriting given some of the tightening that you had done so can you maybe just walk through all of those moving pieces and what you think it means for the trajectory of credit losses thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you sure ill try to get to all those ph many questions ryan so the first one is you think about the fourth quarter i mean you look at the dollar value a little over billion sitting in the 90plus delinquency bucket so i think if you go back and look at how it rolls you get a pretty good sense of what we see from the fourth quarter id say the delinquency performance has been consistent really throughout and really what you have here is a factor of our entry rate into delinquency is still below the pandemic period so its back its lower than which makes collections a little bit tougher on the stuff that does roll in so thats how i think about the fourth quarter when you start to think about and really how we get comfortable around credit performance a handful of things id sit back and say number one we didnt ph accordion the credit box right so we dont open and close it on our partners so our underwriting was consistent and to some degree in the early part of the pandemic we did not shrink as much we did not expand as much when everyone was trying to make up for the lost vintages so we kind of kept consistent throughout that period number one synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 number two our prism advanced underwriting tools allows us to be less score reliant and using the data from our partners we think hopefully we made very good choices or good choices during the pandemic period when i then look at some of the data ryan i still look at the vintages that we put on in the pandemic period theyre generally performing in line with the vintages so were not seeing deterioration even when we look externally the transunion data we see were performing better than the vintages or other folks so again i think we feel comfortable with the tools we have in place i think were comfortable with performance that said ryan we did take some actions here in the third quarter and that was mainly around the fact that we do have a shared consumer so other people who have maybe made certain underwriting choices can flow through to us and so we want to make sure that our loss rate stays in our targeted range and we really took actions in order to ensure or try to ensure that we stay within our targeted underwriting loss rate of to and optimize our risk adjustment margin ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe as a followup brian so the rsa seems to be coming in better than had initially been forecasted given the guidance for for the year and we look forward losses are on a continued normalization and loan growth seems to be slowing so can you maybe just tease out some of the moving pieces as we head into it feels like were kind of back in an environment similar to where we were in the timeframe when credit was normalizing and the rsa was coming in well below that threshold so can you maybe talk through some of those pieces thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks again ryan as i think about the rsa its really performing as we designed it to be right so when losses were extremely low it went over a level and now were back into an environment today its sub and again its driven by a couple of factors one the chargeoff rate chargeoff dollars are clearly an impact most certainly the impact of cost of funds and interestbearing liabilities is flowing through i think as you think forward the things that are going to make it move a little bit its going to be the mix of the portfolio obviously you look at something like health wellness we dont have as much rsa thats going a little bit faster and then again youre going to have in some of the other portfolios that have a maybe higher percentage of rsas depending upon their growth rates will influence it but again it should track consistently i always point to ryan weve talked about this before if you looked at rsas as a percent of purchase volume it is pretty stable through seasonal trends so again we expect it to continue to operate the way it historically has ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan operator thank you well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning erika brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is on the direction of the net interest margin so it seems like weve fully solidified the notion of higher for longer in how should we think about how your net interest margin should perform in a higherfor longer environment and as we think about funding costs on the other side of the cycle when we eventually get to rate cuts although the forward curve keeps pushing that out how sensitive should we think about your funding costs relative to cuts in fed funds brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks erika so i think as we think about the margin as we move forward here theres a little bit of tailwind still to go on prime rate that flows through the books here in the fourth quarter i think the second thing youre going to continue to see is a benefit on the margin coming from higher revolve were still at payment rates that are basis points above the pandemic period so again there should be some pushup there there should be a little bit of a headwind relative to reversals that go against that so thats really as i think about the yield side of the equation on the interestbearing liabilities side of the equation again there were a lot of assets that were put on or excuse me a lot of deposits that were put on this year theyre going to have to reset next year so well see a little bit of tick up next year in the interestbearing liabilities as those shorter days cds hopefully renew i think when you get to the backside of the cycle thats really to be seen right theres a case that could be made where betas will be a little bit slower coming down for some of the folks that want to try to gather deposits and get the yield side of their investment portfolios up there are some that are going to want to try to push down the cost of ph funding payments that are insensitive so i think as we get closer to that we can probably give you a better perspective of which way that will turn erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is on capital theres been a lot of discussion for card companies in particular with regards to how we should treat unfunded commitments and also the timing differences in terms of higher acl ratios in terms of the numerator deductions so could you give us a little bit of a preview so to speak on how the pending new capital rules could impact synchrony and how youre expecting that to impact your approach to capital management synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great question erika so when we look at the rules the first thing id say probably along with others were clearly disappointed with the proposed rules around capital both from the process in which the fed went through as well as certain elements that we dont think were clearly thought through fully if you thought about a holistic review of the capital stack right you combine that with what i would say is some apparent gold plating its very difficult i think for the industry as a whole and i think youre seeing that in banks feedback i think youre seeing it through the trade groups feedback and i think there is some even level of concern with the fed governors with regard to that and then finally when you think about synchrony before i get into the details were clearly disappointed that the tailoring rules effectively have been eliminated by treating us on the same level as a lot of the other banking institutions with that said erika if we looked at just taking those rules as they are again were not sure that they would stay as they are the impact to us is probably between a to higher impact to capital and the range there depends really upon how you treat some of the rsa when you think about the operational risk pieces with the rsa offset the fraud and some of the revenue items when i think about the unfunded commitments that is a fairly significant addback to the rwa the good news for us i think we have a path where through mitigation strategy we think this would be very manageable if it was enacted the way it was today and part of it when you think about the unfunded commitments a good bulk of that is is with accounts that are deemed inactive so we can adjust line strategies without impacting current customers in our business so im not sure as we look at it and we talk about it as a company we believe there is a significant aspect with how weve managed the growth side of the business erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks erika have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess my first question brian wenzel is for you in terms of the reserve rate going forward weve seen some of the card issuers make adjustments to kind of whats inside the reserve and whats not and there are some risks associated with inflation and the fact that just behaviorally things are trending a little bit different than they have in the past maybe you could just talk about the migration of reserve rate going forward and you feel comfortable in the methodology at this point brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 yeah thanks for the question sanjay obviously we feel comfortable at the end of the third quarter that we have the right level of losses as you think about it the base assumptions that we have in the reserve model really didnt change i think when you look at the baselines that are out there theres not a significant shift in the underlying assumptions that are going into the model as we looked at the quarter what you did see is a little bit of shift between the quantitative portion of the model and the qualitative portion but again through the past history we think through the scenarios that we run that weve accounted for a potentially worsening macro we hopefully have captured inflation as part of that model and then we also have student loans as part of it so we feel good about where we are as we sit today and that we can withstand changes in the macro environment that said when we look at it there are basis points of coverage between second quarter third quarter given these models that that isnt significant and i wouldnt read into it that we have a deteriorating picture as we close the quarter sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe one for brian doubles brian can you just talk about sort of the backdrop for portfolio acquisitions any renewals that kind of stuff and then maybe just the competitive environment in general thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure sanjay so look i would say generally its a pretty constructive competitive environment i think what were seeing in the market around pricing new opportunities renewals is pretty disciplined and i think any time you enter into a period like were in right now where theres some uncertainty on the horizon you tend to see issuers stay a little bit more conservative and a little more disciplined which is good news for us in terms of renewals we just announced belk this quarter its a great renewal for us kind of normal course great partner very engaged customer base and so obviously were always out there working the renewal pipeline on our portfolio and then in terms of new opportunities i would say on balance its probably more new program opportunities startup opportunities less of the kind of big programs that are out there coming to market and i think thatll hold true probably for the next to months and then beyond that i think youll probably see some bigger programs come up and be in the market sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks sanjay operator thank you well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc how are you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc first you guys have had pretty steady flow of new accounts the last few quarters im wondering i mean given where youre underwriting and kind of whats going on in the world kind of maybe what are the characteristics of the new customers and any change from where you were a few years ago and then what are the sources of the new customers as well brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look john i would say consistent kind of trends on new accounts both in terms of absolute magnitude as well as where the accounts are coming from one of the things that brian mentioned as we think about underwriting we dont expand the credit box in really good times and we try not to really restrict it in more uncertain times and that means that we have more of a steady trend in terms of both new accounts active accounts et cetera i would tell you that the new programs that we recently launched are performing really well were seeing really good growth there so we continue to be encouraged on that front and youre seeing i would say really good trends across all of the platforms as we look at growth its not one platform thats really outperforming youre seeing that a little bit with health wellness but its pretty broadbased and thats encouraging i think the consumer has been much more resilient than any of us anticipated a year ago and youre seeing that across the board whether you look at purchase volume receivables new accounts active accounts if we had to pick a metric thats one thats probably a little bit more important than new accounts because keeping that consumer engaged offering them more than one product like thats a big part of our strategy and so weve been pleased so far all year john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful and then the second question is i think i ph heard that you guys threw some disclosure that you guys were involved in at least evaluating greensky i am wondering kind of whats the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 appetite for acquisition i would assume the environment is a little bit better now with different opportunities so maybe if you could just take us through what youre looking at and where you might go from that perspective brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i mean look were always opportunistic when it comes to potential ma opportunities at the same time john were extremely disciplined around the financial return of those opportunities making sure that theyre accretive we weigh that against buying back our stock and other opportunities and so look were always in the market weve done some really nice smaller acquisitions over the last couple of years pets best has been an absolute home run for us since we acquired that business i think the pets i2n force is up just between when we acquired it and now allegro has been a great acquisition for us again nice acquisition relatively small in terms of the capital outlay for that but weve been able to leverage the scale of health wellness to grow that we picked up some new products as part of that so those are the types of acquisitions that we really like to do but with that said we look at larger opportunities but theyve got to make sense we balance those against other uses for our capital and theyve got to have a nice return profile for us and a good path to eps accretion john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah operator thank you well take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler please go ahead kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co great thank you have you seen any particular shifts in payment rate trends for the nearprime to prime consumer if your some of your competitors mentioned that there is a little bit more weakness primarily due to household net worth or even savings rates within that cohort are you seeing any changes in payment rates there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning kevin the first thing when we think about the consumer theres a lot of focus that goes into savings rates anyway and id say that the higherend consumer cohorts do have excess savings thats in there but the prime kind of right on the prime level to subprime theyve benefited by a wage increase since which has been able to really bolster them through this period when i look at payment rates and compare them year over year right where you see probably the biggest shift in the payment rate is in that ph to bucket theyre all moving from a little bit more full pay a statement pay down but the biggest shift is in that ph to which isnt necessarily that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 concerning to us its still above where they were in the prepandemic period so id say a shift its not something that we are concerned about or find it to be concerning at this point kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then i know its very early but are you seeing any impact on payment rate trends for folks with federal student loans i know its ph first few weeks ph here but just i wanted to brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial it is early yeah so whats actually interesting kevin when you look at that cohort a couple of things weve done a lot of analysis on this group of people ph we continue to do it i think when you look at the month of september we saw a significant rise in people making payments in advance of the student loan payments beginning in october so thats a very good ph sign for us with regard to that we did a deeper dive and we looked at how they are performing those accounts against instead of the entire book really against id say credit cohorts and to be honest with you kevin youre going to find this interesting theyre actually performing better with people with student loans versus people without student loans so ph theyre clear to be very very cautious again the fact that a significant number of people did pick up payments prior to the due date so again what we expect going forward is that the fourth quarter is going to be a little bit noisy so with regard to people who may have forgotten that new servicers et cetera then youll start to get a much better read as you move into the first quarter whats going to be challenging for issuers is the fact that theyre not we dont expect them to be reported to the bureaus until january so there are things that were going to watch with regard to changing those balances and see whether or not we can detect through the work of the bureaus whether or not they are resuming payments and how much theyre paying down so weve kind of set that up in advance to monitor the population again we think weve provided for them in prior periods for ones that may struggle kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks kevin have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from jeff adelson with morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to get a sense of the brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 good morning jeff jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc just wanted to get an updated view on the late fees from the cfpb here i know were almost done with october and havent heard anything yet just wondering has there been any shift in the dialogue out there or are you still fully expecting the rule to come out as proposed and i guess as a part of that question when the rule comes out are you going to be taking any sort of proactive preemptive actions in preparation or are you more just going to be in the waitandsee approach and wait to see how it plays out in the courts brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah no thanks jeff so look were obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued so theres plenty of unknowns out there until we see the final rule weve got to see things like the implementation period the final amount we also believe that it will be litigated so were going to watch that carefully and that could impact the timing as well so i guess what i would say is look were prepared for multiple scenarios in terms of timing weve been working very closely with our partners for over six months now were working on pricing offsets really with the goal of offsetting the impact here and putting us in a position with our partners where we can underwrite a large crosssection of the customers that we do today were obviously it goes without saying were disappointed in the rule obviously we think it has unintended consequences that werent properly evaluated late fees are a very important incentive to pay just clearly is not an incentive so without those offsets it would restrict access to a pretty significant crosssection of consumers and no change to what weve said in the past our goal is to protect our partners fully offset the impact and continue to underwrite and improve the majority of the customers that we do today jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks and just on the credit tightening side i know youve discussed some more actions there positioning yourself for but at the same time you werent meeting it as hard as your peers you were sort of ahead of the curve there just wondering what would cause you to lean back in at this point is there any sort of signals youre looking for out there or any sort of timing around that to be expecting brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial just to be clear to lean back into loosening credit or indiscernible jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah like when you might widen the credit box again brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah listen we have a very good credit team thats consistently evaluating performance of the portfolio by partner by vertical by channel and i think to some degree we want to see how credit develops across the industry again i talked about a shared consumer so what other issuers are doing or not doing cant have a ph synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 fullthrow effect to us so again well watch those things theres not a telltale sign to say once this happens we will go but our team has a lot of tools we use a lot of data were using much more decision tree and nonscorebased measures in order to assess that and again the data elements that we get from partners will tell us how the consumer is performing so well continue to look at that and again brian said it i said it we dont move the credit box around that often because our partners want consistency in origination our customers want to have underwriting from us and thats part of our lower line low and grow strategy thanks jeff operator thank you well move next to john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi regarding the back to the late fees can you maybe just give us a little bit of color on how you think about the timing of the offsets that youre negotiating at this time with your partners you mentioned pricing and im assuming theres other factors maybe if you could just talk about once the rule goes in place what type of timing should we expect in terms of being able to see some of the offsets of that initial impact brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so look i mean obviously theres still things related to timing that we dont know yet and primarily thats when the rule goes into effect the impact of any litigation as well as the implementation period and the final rule the original rule as written was days thats just clearly not enough time to get this done so we think that hopefully it will be longer than that and those are the discussions that were having with each of our partners and that will influence the nature of the pricing actions and the timing in which they go in so i cant be really more specific than that but weve got a really good plan in place partner by partner weve been working on this for over six months we feel good about the conversations that weve had and the actions that were going to take if the final rule goes into effect as written john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you and then my second question is kind of a twoparter first on the incremental credit actions that you implemented in the third quarter can you maybe just elaborate there around what exactly you did in the third synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 quarter versus what youve been doing previously and then separately you mentioned that the rsas are not as heavy in the health wellness sector or business line can you talk about how much lower and then other product areas that may also have a lower rsa thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so with regard to the credit actions we took a lot of it is around originations but not around necessarily score cutoffs as much as it is different data elements or different criterias that we factor differently in account originations we also are working on account management type actions so triggers that come from the bureaus of certain attributes or criterias where we would turn in a ph forum or watch to a credit line decrease or a closed account so those are the ph probably two flavors of it again its not necessarily shifting cutoff its really focusing on different criteria that are coming into our underwriting account management engine with regard to the second part of your question on the rsas we just highlighted health wellness and i think we said it before theres not a lot of rsa sitting in that particular sales platform so we just its that platform grows at a faster rate has a little bit of an influence on the overall rsa for the company outside of that were not going to go into the different sales platforms from there because the rest do have some level in each of the sales platforms john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thank you for taking my question i wanted to start with just going back to the discussion around credit your credit guidance for the full year implies i think a pretty close to the so getting back to your longterm target i was curious on how you see that evolving i know youve talked about keeping underwriting pretty steady but youve also tightened weve seen some pretty fast normalization here in the back half of this year do you think it gets above your to target for a little bit in before coming back down kind of a give back from the strong yields you had over the last couple of years brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah well good morning mihir the first thing id say and i dont think weve got enough credit for it as a company but we still havent reached and again i know its basis points ph and while we still not have reached our prepandemic delinquency metrics i think theres only a couple of issuers that are in that category so i wouldnt i think we shouldnt undersell that number one synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 i think number two when you look at the performance im not sure i would characterize it as accelerating in the fourth quarter if you go back and look at the growth on a dollar basis on and on average versus this they grew on average to in the period and we grew in this quarter and on a plus and 90plus basis so probably in line id say with seasonality when you look at the relative percentages if you think about bps they were ph and or and were and a little bit over so theres not a big deterioration id sit here and say and characterize it that way as we look at the performance for net chargeoffs next year as a fullyear basis one of the reasons why i think weve tightened a little bit here again given the shared consumer is were trying to maintain losses inside that to and setting up the portfolio well to perform there because thats where we think the optimized riskadjusted margin is for us as a company i know others clearly are thinking now that theyre willing to take a higher net chargeoff rate at a lower margin thats not where we want to operate this company and deploy capital its not as effective for us so were going to be disciplined around that so again when i look at that and if you go back to earlier in the call i talked about some of the vintage performance and other things that weve seen that gives us some level of comfort that we have a pretty good view of the trajectory mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and then maybe just switching gears completely a little bit wanted to ask about the bnpl offering at lowes bnpl obviously not as topical today as maybe or months ago but i think you rolled it out this quarter or very recently it looks like you are the exclusive provider for the bnpl offering there and its a white label basically also synchrony pay which theyre calling lowes pay now i was wondering if you could just maybe expand on that a little bit just talk about what do the economics look like is it tied to your card offering in some way is this a competitive process is this an area youre looking to expand and build out with other retailers how are you thinking about that product thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure so maybe to start more broadly i think this has been an area where weve been investing with our partners i think the pay later products that we offer its a great way of really just to engage more customers and offer them a new financing offer thats got really nice utility we are seeing proof that the product does provide both value to us and to our partners if you look at the results this quarter year over year weve grown installment pay later products so were clearly overindexing in that product so we feel pretty good i think the multiproduct strategy that weve been talking about for well over a year now is starting to pay off and youre seeing that with what we announced and launched with lowes the lowes pay is a white label version of that and so one of the things thats really important to our strategy is flexibility both in terms of how we offer the product inside of our partners but flexibility to the consumer as well so were willing to offer that as synchrony pay later and we do that for a number of partners were also willing to white label it which i think is a real competitive advantage for us because a lot of partners or a lot of competitors are not willing to do that were seeing really good traction on the launch so far and were just really pleased to be able to offer another product inside of our lowes partnership synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mihir operator thank you well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi talk a little bit more about the health of the consumer in terms of the lower end versus the higher end and also do you feel more comfortable on one or the other based on what youre seeing going forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so i think when you look at the consumer across three different metrics the spending metrics the payment metrics and then obviously the credit metrics let me start with credit first that consumer is the one who were struggling to see a little bit more of those back to prepandemic levels in delinquency and their performance in delinquency and then deeper nonprime performing a little bit worse so from a credit standpoint they get in delinquency they dont really have the ability to cure out of it and are using other forms like settlements and debt settling companies in order to kind of solve some of it and that to be expected in this environment they just dont have as much access to liquidity again whats keeping that consumer base going is a broadbased wage increase that has helped fuel that so even though they may have spent the dollars that they got during the pandemic stimulus packages they do see larger wage gains so again what were continuing to see is why the transaction values are a little bit lower for them the frequency is up and theyre continuing to spend it we think at a very manageable pace again when we look at our book and look at the average balance in our book if you look at versus now its up a cagr of and the opentobuy is up a little bit more so i think the consumer is being relatively disciplined and there is more liquidity in the system for them clearly when we look at highend consumers the highend consumer is performing incredibly well their payment rates remain above levels they are showing strength weve skewed in high end of prime up probably percentage points in the super high end which also has helped the portfolio performance so again we feel good and when i look at the entire portfolio entry into delinquency is still below levels donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks brian synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator thank you well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question this morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc most have been asked and answered but i just ph would talk a little bit more about the rsa guide and the improvement there when we look at the chargeoff rate when we look at nim when we look at everything it looks like everything is kind of within the range but of expectations both from an originals perspective at the beginning of the year and from a second quarter perspective but for whatever reason you feel like the rsa charge is going to be down a little bit is that really just a function of mix or what else is contributing to that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question rick it really is mix between the platforms and between the portfolios and theyre each of these arrangements are different theyre unique by partner so certain partners are performing better than others certain ones have volumebased measures as well so it really depends on where that volume goes and the performance of the individual portfolio so that is the main driver richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick operator and we will take our next question from saul martinez with hsbc please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question yeah most of my questions have been asked but maybe if you could just go back to your comments on reserves levels and reserve adequacy and where we go from here i get that your reserves you seem to be indicating that you feel comfortable with your reserve ratios and you are i think still about to basis points if im not mistaken above your dayone cecl allowance levels but you are expecting ncos to normalize and move higher i would expect your losses that will flow through your ph reasonable exportable period will be moving higher as we move forward but maybe you can comment on your reserve outlook going forward and what would induce you to maybe build reserves what would need to happen for some additional reserve builds above and beyond what you need for growth brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question so the way i would think about the reserve as we move forward is you should see a rotation as you stabilize in delinquencies in this normalization period that the quantitative model absorbs that trend line and then as we get more comfortable with the macro backdrops the effects of inflation as student loans if they have an impact flow through the portfolio youll see the qualitative piece begin to come down and effectively offset that and then youll move down ultimately we think towards that dayone level if the assumptions come in generally as we think about it if you think about incremental provisioning on a rate basis here again most of the time were talking about things that are growthdriven in the portfolio but truly ratedriven ones a couple of factors that we look at is clearly if you have a deterioration in collection performance that could do it mainly thats associated a lot of times with unemployment claims rising so that could be a second factor that kind of goes in there but collection performance and unemployment claims are two of probably the bigger ones that wed see again we havent seen trends in collections that would warrant that today so we feel good about that and unemployment claims have still remained historically low so again we think we factored into our reserve at the end of the third quarter qualitative assessments potentially deteriorating macro and well just have to see how that plays out saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thats helpful thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator and we are allotted time for questions today so we will take our final question from arren cyganovich with citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2023 thanks ill be quick your share buybacks came down just a touch can you talk about your outlook for buybacks in the quarters ahead brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah first of all good morning arren glad we were able to get your question in with regard to the buybacks we generally do not give or we have not given quarterly guidance with regard to how the repurchase flow out for the quarter at the end of the quarter we had million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization as we move through the end of the capital year in june of next year what i probably want to be clear about with regard to that level for a second is whats not really driving the dollar amount so i just really want to be clear that its not related to a change in the macro environment for us number one two its not related to any potential proposals on late fees and then three its not related to basel iii endgame we have a set of mile markers that weve set out in the capital plan thats more rwabased than really how our income kind of comes in versus plan so those are the factors and again we considered the other factors but that was not factored into our decision for the third quarter repurchases arren cyganovich q analyst
