we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions for a discussion of certain trends and conditions see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsbusiness trends and conditions in our form 10k for a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three months ended march see results of operations cfpb final rule on credit card late fees on march the cfpb released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the truth in lending act to lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior adjusted to for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles to and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount the final rule when effective will result in a significant reduction in our interest and fees on loan receivables industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court and the outcome of such challenge including the impact on the final rule is uncertain the final rule if not impacted by litigation has an effective date of may in response to the final rule we have begun to implement a number of product policy and pricing changes to adjust for the significant reduction in our late fee income in addition the combined net effects of the final rule and our mitigating strategies would result in a decrease in payments to partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements while we continue to believe that the strategies we have identified and started to implement will fully offset the decline in late fee income over time it will take time for such product policy and pricing changes to offset the reduction in the late fees and therefore we expect the final rule will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the magnitude of these effects in remain uncertain due to the pending litigation discussed above which could result in a delay in the final rules effective date to the extent the final rule becomes effective in may the final rule would have a material impact to our net income for the year ended december in addition the effects of the final rule are also subject to other factors which could increase the adverse effects to our results of operations including our ability to successfully implement the product policy and pricing changes we have identified as well as any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to these changes or the final rule itself for a discussion of risks related to a cfpb final late fee rule please see risk factors relating to our businessthe cfpbs proposed rule on credit card late fees if adopted would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in our form 10k seasonality                                                                                              we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends the seasonal trends discussed above are most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year particularly with respect to our loan receivables which decreased by billion or to billion at march compared to billion at december and our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables that increased to at march from at december however in addition to these seasonal trends the elevated customer payment behavior we have experienced in recent years and more recently the subsequent moderation from these elevated levels has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics and the fluctuations experienced between quarterly periods the effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted in either partial or in some instances full offset to the impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above for the three months ended march this is most evident in our loan receivables days past due which increased to billion at march from billion at december due to the impact from lower customer payment rates which exceeded the effects of the seasonal trends we experienced the same factors also provided a partial offset to the seasonal decrease in our total loan receivables in the first quarter of results of operations                                                                                              highlights for the three months ended march below are highlights of

scores are obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed at a minimum quarterly but could be as often as weekly to assist in predicting customer behavior we categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories i or higher which are considered the strongest credits ii to considered moderate credit risk and iii or less which are considered weaker credits there are certain customer accounts including for our commercial credit products for which a vantagescore score is not available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit quality and predict behavior the following table provides the most recent vantagescore scores or equivalent available for our revolving credit card and commercial credit product customers at march december and march

note variable interest entities we use vies to securitize loan receivables and arrange assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business investors in these entities only have recourse to the assets owned by the entity and not to our general credit we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie and we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any of these vies in the three months ended march and our vies are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new assetbacked financings consistent with the requirements and limitations on such activities placed on the vie by existing investors once an account has been designated to a vie the contractual arrangements we have require all existing and future loan receivables originated under such account to be transferred to the vie the amount of loan receivables held by our vies in excess of the minimum amount required under the assetbacked financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under removal of accounts provisions all loan receivables held by a vie are subject to claims of thirdparty investors in evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact its economic performance we consider the purpose for which the vie was created the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decisionmaking role if any in those activities that significantly determine the entitys economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders this evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decisionmaking that affects the entitys future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decisionmaking rights are most important in determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a vie we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity regardless of form debt equity management and servicing fees and other contractual arrangements this evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entitys design including the entitys capital structure contractual rights to earnings or losses subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the potential to be economically significant the evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment we consolidate vies where we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the vies economic performance typically because of our role as either servicer or administrator for the vies the power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the vies assets as well as directing certain affairs of the vies including determining whether and on what terms debt of the vies will be issued the loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard accordingly the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables and the blended performance of the pools of receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer contractually the cash flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay thirdparty debt holders as well as other expenses of the entity excess cash flows if any are available to us the creditors of these entities have no claim on our

limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements under capital adequacy guidelines we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets liabilities and certain offbalancesheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the tables below of total tier and common equity tier capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and of tier capital to

unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated us federal income taxes excludes amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements the liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically when new information becomes available the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to be resolved in the next twelve months is expected to be million of which million if recognized would reduce the companys tax expense and effective tax rate in the current year the company executed a memorandum of understanding with the irs to participate voluntarily in the irs compliance assurance process cap program for the tax year and thus the tax year is under irs review the irs is also examining our tax year and we expect the review will be completed in the current year additionally we are under examination in various states going back to we believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations note legal proceedings and regulatory matters in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished income and damage to our reputation we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued for some matters we are able to determine that an estimated loss while not probable is reasonably possible for other matters including those that have not yet progressed through discovery andor where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved we are unable to make such an estimate we currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss are immaterial this represents managements estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information this estimate of possible loss does not represent our potential maximum loss exposure the legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues the breadth of the claims often spanning multiple years unspecified damages andor the novelty of the legal issues presented based on our current knowledge we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings other than as described below during the quarter ended march there were no material changes to the legal proceedings previously disclosed in our form 10k on january a purported shareholder derivative action gilbert v keane et al was filed in the us district court for the district of connecticut against the company as a nominal defendant and certain of the companys officers and directors the lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims based on the allegations raised by the plaintiff in the stichting depositary apg class action unjust enrichment waste of corporate assets and that the defendants made materially misleading statements andor omitted material information in violation of the exchange act the complaint seeks a declaration that the defendants breached andor aided and abetted the breach of their fiduciary duties to the company unspecified monetary damages with interest restitution a direction that the defendants take all necessary actions to reform and improve corporate governance and internal procedures and attorneys and experts fees on march a second purported shareholder derivative action aldridge v keane et al was filed in the us district court for the district of connecticut the allegations in the aldridge complaint are substantially similar to those in the gilbert complaint on march the district court recaptioned the gilbert and aldridge cases as in re synchrony financial derivative litigation on august the parties submitted a joint status report to the district court indicating that the parties had reached a memorandum of understanding to settle the litigation which is not expected to have a material financial impact on the company on december the
