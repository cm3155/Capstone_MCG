the first quarter of and million for the fourth quarter of the decrease in ppnr for the first quarter of compared to the previous periods was due to lower combined net interest revenue and fees and

dividend of per common share payable on or about may to shareholders of record as of may results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of net interest revenue decreased million due to changes in interest rates and increased million from growth in earning assets largely due to the increase in trading securities balances table shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities net interest margin was percent for the first quarter of compared to percent for the first quarter of in response to the anticipated impact to the economy from the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in march other shortterm market interest rates followed reducing the yield on floatingrate assets by more than the amount by which funding costs could be reduced compressing the margin the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was percent a decrease of basis points compared to the first quarter of loan yields decreased basis points to percent largely due to the decrease in shortterm interest rates partially offset by the addition of ppp loan fees ppp loan fees of million were recognized in the first quarter of and million remains to be recognized in future periods the available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased basis points to percent as principal cash flows received from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio continue to be reinvested at lower rates cash flows received from these securities are currently being reinvested at basis

customers as borrowers continue to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty fair vale option securities that we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased billion average deposits increased billion compared to the first quarter of deposit growth is largely due to customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment supplemented by the most recent government stimulus payments interestbearing deposits increased billion while demand deposit balances increased billion taxequivalent net interest revenue decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of net interest margin was percent compared to percent in the fourth quarter of the decrease in net interest revenue was primarily driven by lower average outstanding loan balances reinvestment of cash flows from the available for sale securities portfolio to current interest rates and timing of ppp and other loan fees also contributed to a decrease in net interest revenue and net interest margin in the first quarter average earning assets decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of average loan balances decreased million

was down basis points to percent the benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by noninterest liabilities was basis points for the first quarter of consistent with the prior quarter our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in

other assets securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading we expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the recent impact of the covid19

following the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights msrs changes in response to changes in primary mortgage loan rates and other assumptions we attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of msrs by designating certain financial instruments as an economic hedge changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of msrs historically low mortgage rates in and early resulted in a favorable risk profile for our msrs that supported hedge performance during that time period a sharp increase in

banking activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private banking services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds actual net credit losses and capital costs in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is updated annually at the beginning of the year and transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also updated annually at the beginning of the year and is based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm libor rate and a moving average of an intermediateterm swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the shortterm libor rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediateterm swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table net income attributable to our lines of business decreased million compared to the first

agencies principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed commercial mortgagebacked securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans a primary risk of holding residential mortgagebacked securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of falling interest rates we evaluate this risk through

pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs credit risk and profit the customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our
