compared to the nine months ended september mortgage banking revenue decreased million as rapidly rising mortgage interest rates and continued inventory shortages have adversely affected both loan production volume and margins a million decrease in trading revenue due to disruption in the fixed income markets related to economic uncertainty primarily in the first quarter of was partially offset by a million increase in customer hedging revenue and million increase in investment banking revenue fiduciary and asset management revenue increased million led by growth in mutual fund fees and

quarter of a million provision for credit losses was recorded for the nine months ended september primarily due to loan growth and increased uncertainty in the economic outlook partially offset by improving credit quality metrics an million negative provision for credit losses was recorded for the nine months ended september due to forecasts for improving macroeconomic factors including stabilizing energy prices and improving credit quality metrics results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the third quarter of and million for the second quarter of compared to the second quarter of net interest revenue increased million from changes in interest rates and decreased million from changes in earning assets table shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities average earning assets decreased million compared to the second quarter of average trading securities were reduced by million in response to lower origination volumes in the residential mortgage industry driven by increases in interest rates average loan balances increased million largely due to growth in commercial real estate loans and loans to individuals the average balance of available for sale securities which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by us government agencies decreased billion while investment securities increased billion this change reflects the fullquarter impact of the transfer of billion of us government agency mortgagebacked securities from available for sale to the investment securities portfolio late in the second quarter we purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk interestbearing cash and cash equivalents decreased million total average deposits were reduced by billion compared to the second quarter of as customers deploy cash resources into higher yielding alternatives funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased million while other borrowings increased million net interest margin was percent compared to percent in the second quarter of in response to rising inflation the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate basis points in the third quarter bringing the yeartodate total rate increases to basis points the resulting impact on market interest rates increased net interest margin as our earning assets led by variablerate loans reprice at a higher rate and faster pace than our interestbearing liabilities the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was percent an increase of basis points loan yields increased basis points to percent the yield on trading securities was up basis points to percent the available for sale securities portfolio yield increased basis points to percent the yield on investment securities decreased basis points due to the transfer of securities from the available for sale portfolio to the investment portfolio the yield on interestbearing cash and cash equivalents increased basis points funding costs were percent a basis point increase the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points to percent the cost of other borrowings increased basis points to percent while the cost of funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased basis points to percent the benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by noninterest liabilities was basis points an increase of basis points our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately percent of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown

fees and commissions revenue diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented percent of total revenue for the third quarter of excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading the velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized as interest rates are expected to move higher we expect to experience increased benefits to our net interest margin which provides an offset to reduced mortgage related fee income generally for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates we expect growth to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic

wealth management commercial banking includes lending treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses middle market and larger commercial customers commercial banking also includes the transfund eft network consumer banking includes retail lending and deposit services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private banking services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds and capital costs credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered the difference between credit costs attributed to the lines of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to funds management in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table net income attributable to our lines of business increased million compared to the second quarter of net interest revenue increased million primarily due to loan growth and changes in interest rates net chargeoffs increased million other

mortgagebacked securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans a primary risk of holding residential mortgagebacked securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest

derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our customers and from the counterparties customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and
