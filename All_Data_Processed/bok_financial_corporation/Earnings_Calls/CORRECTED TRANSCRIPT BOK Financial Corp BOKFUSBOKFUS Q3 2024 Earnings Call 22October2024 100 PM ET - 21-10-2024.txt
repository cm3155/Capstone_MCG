financial corp thank you heather were pleased to report earnings of million or eps of per diluted share for the third quarter as weve mentioned previously we are a strong and growing company that has prioritized generating attractive longterm results and we have demonstrated that again this quarter during the quarter net interest income and net interest margin have stabilized and started an upward trend consistent with prior expectations were also on track to capturing the down rate deposit base as we communicated the credit performance of our loan portfolio remains excellent we had net recoveries during the quarter criticized classified levels remain below normalized prepandemic levels and a combined allowance that remains robust at of outstanding loans given our strong credit profile and performance loan commitments remain stable although as marc will cover later robust capital markets activity during the quarter impacted growth in outstanding loan balances we are encouraged by current sales activity and the trajectory that sets up going forward our fee income segments performed particularly well and contributed significantly to our overall results scott will talk more about those details shortly but i wanted to note that we are proud of surpassing the billion mark for assets under management or administration for the first time in our history these results were achieved while preserving strong levels of liquidity with continued growth in our deposit portfolio showcasing the strength of our franchise we remain wellpositioned for growth while maintaining regulatory and tangible capital levels that are attractive versus peers our performance is reflective of solid operational execution and the strength of the economic conditions in our markets we remain focused on delivering value to our customers and shareholders during the quarter we also saw the first cut in rates from the federal reserve and im happy with the proactive steps our team is working through to adapt quickly to this change marty will discuss this in more detail later its also important to consider that for the first time in more than two years the yield curve is no longer inverted as of the end of the quarter while we may be neutral to the level of rates there is certainly upside to our operating model when the yield curve is normal and upward sloping this bodes well for us moving forward im pleased with the results the bokf team produced this quarter and im optimistic about the trajectory our team has established the economic backdrop were operating in should allow us to continue generating attractive returns moving forward and with that ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide overall period end loans decreased linked quarter with commercial loans down and cre up however average loan balances contracted only million or despite the slight pullback in outstandings this quarter we continue to grow new commitments and relationships if you look at core ci which is reflective of our general business and services outstandings in those segments increased in a yearoveryear rate and total commitments have grown at a yearoveryear rate bok financial experienced consecutive quarters of loan growth until the third quarter while the unique nature of the markets in the specialty lending areas impacted this consistent loan growth this quarter we remain optimistic about our loan growth for future periods portfolio yields increased basis points during the quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 the majority of that increase was due to growth in loan fees which i will break down in more detail as we walk through our loan segments loan balances in the energy business decreased linked quarter most of this was driven by broader trends and the public debt market appetite for this sector in  we saw a more accommodating bond market with issuance in domestic energy debt transactions increasing significantly on a linked quarter basis this activity does reduce outstanding loan balances however we have the ability to capture some of the bond economics of these transactions which are accretive to earnings and led to a quarterly record in our investment banking revenue we realized additional early payoff fees which contributed to the yield increase i noted previously further energy balances this quarter were affected by ma activity with the acquisition of several of our customers resulting in the payoff of their loans in many cases we also participate andor lead the credit facilities of the acquiring institutions but are seeing lower levels of leverage after the business combination this has contributed to utilization rates in energy falling from to during the quarter weve grown energy commitments over the last several years but temporary factors can moderate growth in outstandings in any given period our combined general business and service loans fell linked quarter which has given back some of the seasonal advances that were outlined last quarter looking more broadly these segments are continuing to post strong growth being up on a yearoveryear basis with loan pipelines remaining stable our healthcare business loans decreased linked quarter payoffs increased as longer term rates and spreads made it attractive for some borrowers to refinance in the fixed rate hud market our pipeline remains robust driven by potential new acquisition activity our cre business increased quarteroverquarter as weve discussed previously we were very close to our concentration limit several quarters ago as paydowns have reduced cre levels we are gathering new commitments and rebuilding outstandings as new loans fund up during the construction phase of these projects we are committed to our strict concentration limit which is of tier capital and reserves on a committed basis but is currently at which gives us plenty of room for growth that should continue to build over time i wont cover slide in detail but this remains a good testament to the attractive longterm performance of our credit transitioning to slide credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio extending our trend of outperformance versus peers in this area npas not guaranteed by the us government fell again this quarter decreasing million the resulting nonperforming assets to period end loans and repossessed assets decreased basis point to basis points committed criticized assets remain very low relative to historical standards further we had net recoveries of during the quarter and net chargeoffs have averaged seven basis points over the last months looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to remain below historical norms we are well reserved with a combined allowance for credit losses of million or of outstanding loans and now ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp thank you marc turning to our operating results for the quarter total fee income grew million contributing million of revenue and representing of total revenue which continues to differentiate us from our peers and represents another strong contribution from these lines of business bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 id like to begin by covering our markets and securities businesses on slide both our trading and mortgage banking businesses can be volatile and fluctuate significantly in any given quarter based on current market conditions and expectations from the markets but have shown very positive risk adjusted returns consistent with the industry trends our trading fees decreased to million during the quarter which was driven by lower mbs volumes as client demand ahead of anticipated rate cuts was relatively muted this is partially offset by strong activity in the municipal sector our trading volumes and spreads are greatly influenced by the mortgage origination market while showing improvement compared to industry mortgage origination volumes remained significantly below historical norms given the recent rate cut and anticipated cuts ahead we expect those volumes to continue to return to more normal levels which aligns with the current industry viewpoint on that topic mortgage banking revenue has remained relatively unchanged for the past three quarters coming in at million for the third quarter the mortgage origination market remains relatively soft as origination volumes increase and the environment normalizes both trading revenues and mortgage banking revenues should be positively impacted while we face some headwinds in this space over the past two years we believe the outlook has improved from current levels our other markets and securities businesses continue to produce solid results we recognized a record quarter for investment banking fees coming in at million led by our texas municipal bond underwriting team and bond economics related to the energy payoffs that marc noted in his comments turning to slide asset management revenue was consistent with the second quarter at million growth in our trust fee income nearly offset last quarters seasonal tax preparation fees assets under management administration grew billion with increased market valuations as stacy mentioned in his opening commentary we eclipsed the billion mark for the first time and were proud of the decades of work that have contributed to building this platform transaction card revenue grew by to million driven by higher volume of transactions processed these businesses produce attractive peer leading returns and give us a resilience to market stresses contributing greatly to the strength of our franchise they are core to our business model and were built over decades of investment we are thrilled with the strong financial results these teams are producing and the outlook for growth and now ill hand the call over to marty to cover financials martin e grunst chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you scott turning to slide net interest income was up million and net interest margin was up basis points with core net interest margin excluding trading up basis points within the basis points basis points were due to unusually high loan fees in  driven by the increased level of loan payoffs which is not expected to recur the remaining basis points are on track with the drivers we have talked about over the last couple quarters causing asset repricing to exceed liability repricing including securities and fixed rate loan repricing and less deposit mix shift out of dda the strong interest bearing deposit growth in  also supported both net interest margin and net interest income deposit repricing activity resulting from the basis point fed rate cut is also on track with our expectations both the index deposits and the high beta portions of our commercial and wealth deposit book were repriced lower in bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 conjunction with the fed rate cut these actions were largely completed by quarter end and give us a high degree of confidence that we will realize our deposit beta expectations as market rates decline overall deposit betas on the way down should be similar in magnitude debated on the way up if we see continued interest bearing deposit growth in  that may impact the calculated deposit beta a bit but not the liability beta as that growth would replace wholesale borrowings and be incrementally beneficial to margin and nii turning to slide linked quarter total expenses increased million or personnel expenses grew million largely driven by incentive compensation expense which is primarily timing related looking at the average of the last two quarters personnel expense may be useful that increase was offset by lower non personnel expenses which included a decrease related to the million charitable contribution made to the bokf foundation in the second quarter slide provides our view on full year and i will note a couple of changes loan growth expectations were revised to reflect this quarters specialized lending payoff activity that marc covered in his commentary deposit growth has remained strong with new balances being added below the cost of wholesale borrowings we expect net interest income to be slightly higher than billion fees and commissions were adjusted to reflect recent and current conditions in mbs trading and provision expense was also adjusted to reflect the very strong credit quality results we continue to experience we are in the midst of our budgeting process for next year so consistent with our normal practice we will provide guidance when we announce  results in january with that i would like to hand the call back to the operator for qa which will be followed by closing remarks from stacy question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions maybe i could just start on some of the loan payoff commentary certainly understand some of the specialized segments in energy but when i look at the kind of the market breakdown it looks like you experienced declines in even some of the smaller markets that you guys are in so i know you talked positively about future loan growth pipelines being full can you just give us some color there as to maybe what pipelines look like now versus a quarter couple of quarters ago and do you think some of the headwinds around the election will actually cause people to actually borrow just some color there would be great thanks marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp well ill take the last part first its marc ill just say that obviously uncertainty will cause people to delay decisions so its likely that some of those decisions will be resolved by the election or views on tax policy going forward in the shortterm but we do expect that that will have an impact later this year but were looking at our pipelines overall we feel pretty strongly that in the ci world that our pipelines are in good shape fundamentally were looking at the ci portfolio that as we said in the second quarter we were at a seasonal high during that quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 and then we have seen that come down in the third quarter in line with what our pattern has been in the past this is not an unusual development but if we look at the thats why we concentrate on yearoveryear growth and so we had in yearoveryear growth in ci and growth in commitments and utilization is only down from to so the pattern has existed but we actually have raised the overall level of our commercial and industrial loan throughout the year not just looking at third quarter to second quarter so i would say when we then look at our experience in the smaller markets all the different markets weve been very actively acquiring talent in those markets and weve been actively increasing our calling and pursuing business because we are in good position from a capital standpoint from a credit standpoint to pursue business and we feel comfortable that barring any significant change in the economy that were going to be able to generate future loan growth and were in a good position going forward with that over the next months or plus stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp michael this is stacy just to pile on i think weve had consecutive quarters of loan growth and so you had a really unique circumstance this quarter around energy and healthcare that impacted the totals overall youve got lots of tailwind i think as we look into the next months around commercial real estate because we were well below our concentration limits and so weve got room to find out there weve got really good we track ph through sales force we track our pipelines monthly quarterly everything were looking at there still feels very good to us marc is right there can be some uncertainty that happens around election season or next year you think about tax policy but if you just look on the surface those core ci areas are growing yearoveryear were really happy with that we strung together up until this quarter consecutive quarters of loan growth we still feel confident theres nothing here inherently thats changed our confidence in our ability to grow the portfolio in fact were continuing to add significant talent some of which we havent even announced yet in some of our markets so were confident that well continue to grow loans as we move forward michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for that and maybe just one for scott certainly understand some of the nearterm headwinds as it relates to maybe mortgage banking and some of the brokerage trading softness at least sequentially this quarter but it sounds like the outlook and what you guys are trying to put forward is relatively positive what do you see as kind of the greatest opportunities among fees as we think about the next couple of quarters and where could there still be some headwinds and maybe how would the impact of lower rates meaning if we get more cuts in the forward curve or maybe less in the forward curve how would that in your view impact some of the fee lines business thanks scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp right so great question i think that when you look in detail at the trading line item it is entirely limited to the mortgage backed securities sector where weve seen significant headwinds and so when you parse that out and eliminate the mbs we actually saw increases in all of our other product set so municipals corporates treasuries all of our fixed income activity was actually up absent the mbs so we did and have seen beginning in midseptember with the fed move we have seen an uptick in the activity on the mbs side and the question that remains is the degree to which well see continued momentum in activity bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 but we have seen an inflection point in terms of the activity in the volumes there on even the mbs side but we continue to have constructive belief about our positioning inside the municipal bond space both from an underwriting and a trading perspective on the asset management side weve got consistent sources of inflows to offset our general churn in our assets with disbursements etcetera so we like our allocation of our assets in terms of our auma with in cash fixed income equities and alternatives so were well balanced and i think poised to continue to benefit in asset growth from the market perspective but probably more significantly more importantly on our flows in on our asset management side so were constructive on all of those and continue to see positive trends develop really across the board on those basis and then i think marty you want to comment a little bit on mortgage production martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah michael so id say mortgage production we feel like theres good opportunity in the future there i mean current period production levels are still a little depressed but i think as time moves forward and we see the rate declines continue well see both volume come back up and gain on sale production that percentage was a little bit lower  i think youll see it go back to more like what you saw in  so i think that theres opportunity in that line item as well stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp but theres no doubt theres pressure there i think if you think about other areas weve got like mike we dont talk about our atm business transfund our transaction card business up very steady and these guys have really turned the growth corner im excited about kind of where theyre headed over the next to months from their perspective they went through a really difficult system conversion a couple of years ago and really kind of got through that mess and have turned the corner in a meaningful way there our businesses arent all designed to go up and to the right and so some of these businesses like the trading was impacted by mbs or the mortgage businesses are going to be softer when others are performing very well i mean scott mentioned the fiduciary business i mean billion of assets under management lots of tailwind from the markets today were awfully excited about the opportunities there over the next year or so so its not all going to go in tandem together as it goes up into the right but the mix is very good and we like how it all works together over different cycles michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great well everyone thank you so much ill step back operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning or good afternoon i guess stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes marty clarification question for you on expenses you expect the incentive comp number to come back down in to kind of a more normalized level i guess and i think you said the average of last two quarters is a run rate for comp is that  and  or  and  martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah jon if you look at  at million for personnel expense thats low versus kind of a run rate level in  at million thats high i mean the easy way to do it is to just average those two and that gives you much better sense for kind of what our run rate is for that line item theres just the way you have to recognize incentive comp thats not always sometimes theres a little noise quartertoquarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thank you on that then on deposits slide you guys had youre talking about almost billion in growth for the quarter curious where youre finding the opportunities to grow deposits in general is this client movement or is it market share gains or whats driving that martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah its more commercial and wealth broadly but a little bit more skewed towards commercial and its a combination of new clients were bringing to the bank probably a little bit more of that is existing clients but its broad based across the business marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah jon some of that is mix change we have customers that are moving from dda and theyre taking advantage of the opportunity and moving in it were not losing them as deposits were just changing the mix from a dda to more of a interest bearing option jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp we have i would say we have added a number of new customers over this last 18month period jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and just back on the specialty businesses and energy growth or energy pressures in terms of balances what do you think changes that is it just as simple as the bond market is open and theres ma happening there what changes some of those heavy payoffs in those businesses thanks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp this is stacy i mean theres a lot that could change i dont think that what happened in the third quarter i think is unique for energy and we just had a bunch that kind of coincidentally all happened at the same time it tends to be a little bit more ratable over these type of periods i think if you look just today which doesnt mean thats the way itll end at the end of the year but energy is up relatively materially from where it was at the end of september that could change but i dont think theres some fundamental shift here thats happening with energy that theres going to continue to be pressure on balances i think that there may still be some leftover capital markets activity or ma activity that could get impact the balances for a quarter or two here but i think the bulk of that should be behind us and i would expect those balances to grow as we move forward particularly over the next if you think about when i think about things over kind of the ph to months or longer time horizon i think youll see those balances grow from the end of the third quarter over the next months for sure marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah and i would only add that clearly this is one of the more stable markets weve had in a long long time i mean its been consistently good pricing in the oil market and customers are going to still have to invest in order to maintain their borrowing bases and continue their production and so forth so we do expect and weve been in this business a long time and well get our share of those opportunities as they come about jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay all right thank you for the help operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thank you your expense growth its kind of been running high the last two years even excluding fdic and charitable contributions are there opportunities to lower that expense growth and what do you think a more normalized growth rate is for the company martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah peter id say couple of things so efficiency is super important to us were always looking to manage to appropriate efficiency ratios at each line thats more important at the line of business level than all rolled up actually as we think about it and those numbers will move around just as margin moves around but youre right expense growth is something that we pay attention to and want to make sure that every line of business is doing so in a prudent way however we are also very focused on investing in our business and growing our business and so that takes the form of adding producers and adding technological capability to serve customers and so youll see that in a couple of line items so we feel good about what weve delivered this year but ill just note that data processing and communications weve got investments that are really good investments for longterm growth for the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 company and so what you saw just looking at this quarter for example thats a couple indiscernible line of business that have grown really well and were very excited about what that means for the company but youll see that step up and thats not going to come back to be sure and then as we add people youll see occupancy is a step function for growth in people and so youll see that come up over time if thats part of what your question was stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp but peter if you look at the overall efficiency i mean i think to be where we are with the rate environment where its been looking at it by line of business we feel really good about kind of managing from an efficient perspective i think youll see us make some investments here and i think youll see us work really hard to maintain the efficiency ratio where were at today but i also think that youve got a couple of businesses that are not funding not operating at a high revenue level where theyve been in the past that drag that efficiency a little bit and so we like those businesses they help us through a long cycle but they do impact it and so were not too worried about that but like marty said its more important for us to look at it at a line of business level and were very comfortable with our efficiency when we look at it through that lens peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay and then if i can ask the deposit growth as i think jon mentioned was very strong its been very strong its been outpacing the loan growth so with the loan to deposit ratio just are there opportunities maybe to push down deposit costs more aggressively than you thought maybe a quarter ago and is there kind of a certain level you dont want to see that loan to deposit ratio go above martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah were not managing to a loan to deposit ratio per se but youre right having a loan to deposit ratio as we do does give us the ability to manage deposits very well and so what we did in the third quarter were very happy about the progress we made in being able to bring down deposit rates as a result of the fed move and got a good bit of that done before the end of the quarter were still a little bit more or less to go and all of that gives us the confidence that were going to continue to expand margin as we go from  into  and thats a sustainable trend for us peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and that expansion on the margin thats on a core basis points right not the recorded martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp i think youll see that in both as we go from  to  peter j winter q analyst da davidson co so even above the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thats right peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay thats great great thanks marty operator your next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good afternoon wanted just to follow up on that and talk about the margin from here and i know you had i believe it was basis points due to payoffs and core expansion of basis points can you talk maybe a little bit more about the drivers that you expect in and then it sounded like you were pretty comfortable with deposit betas i just wanted to dive in a little bit more on your lowering deposit rates post that first fed cut martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp sure yeah so keep in mind that sofr actually term sofr actually had a rate cut in it by september i mean it was basis points down from where it was early on so we actually saw some impact in the loan book in september and then we were able to get both wholesale and deposits down through the end of the quarter and still ended up with really good results at the end of the quarter and so that only gets a little bit better when you get into the fourth quarter so those repricing dynamics we understand very well and are very comfortable with how that plays through theres always some denominator effects that can happen if overall trading moves around but we feel very confident about how that will play out over the next for the next quarter stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp brett we talked a lot about the loan and deposit book but dont forget weve got a fixed rate security portfolio thats got a year plus or minus duration thats funded with floating rate liabilities thats going to move down commensurate with every indiscernible and so thats part of whats behind the confidence of whats going to happen with net interest margin and interest income martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp so everything i just talked about is still on top of the fixed rate securities are still repricing up a portion of the fixed rate loan book thats still repricing up that stuffs still happening as it has for the last couple of quarters so that will continue to be supportive brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then the other thing was just im curious i think people kind of view you guys as very selective ma players and maybe thered be some others that might be more aggressive than you and im just bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 curious to hear your thoughts on what you see playing out in the environment conversations what youre seeing activity wise or maybe chatter wise with some of your potential partners stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah just i mean just broadly i think that were interested in the right opportunity its just that those have been difficult to find were not interested in somebody whos got a large concentration in commercial real estate because of our discipline there we value core deposits we value deposit franchises we think those are really key to banking and theres just not a lot that kind of fits the size profile and exactly what were looking for and so and that remains a possibility to the extent that theres something available but thats not how that really weve always viewed as kind of the cherry on top of the sundae our strategy isnt to buy something to achieve the next level of growth were so focused on organic growth if nothing were never successful of buying another bank wed still think were going to perform very well because of our emphasis on organic growth but were not out of the market as it relates to things that could happen from an acquisition perspective theyre just low probability events for which theres not a lot that really fits our criteria today brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough appreciate all the color stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of woody lay with kbw please go ahead wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks for taking my questions wanted to start on the deposit side and more specifically the time deposit portfolio was just curious how much of that portfolio reprices in the fourth quarter and if you could sort of walk through the repricing dynamics there martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes thats largely a consumer book and so thats got a tail that goes out well over a year so its not a huge amount in any given month because its so granular so its that in and of itself is not going to have a large impact on the pricing characteristics of the deposit book wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then maybe just one followup on cre it sounds like cre activity is picking up a little bit and you have a clear advantage relative to competitors just given the concentration levels could you give us some color on what youre seeing in terms of the loan competition in the space stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 yeah i think theres a little less competition but theres a lot of theres also a few deals i mean some of those customers that weve been with for a long time are moving more cautiously and slowly so thats impacting that a little bit but clearly there is some advantage that we have by being able to begin the market when others are still trying to manage their concentration levels but thats part of why were confident that well weve never had trouble filling that bucket and so well continue to prospect and to grow existing customers principally with an occasional new customer mixed in there but im confident that over the next to months well refill that bucket thats never been an issue that were worried about growing wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right sounds good thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks for taking the question guys just wanted to go back on the investment securities portfolio marty i think you mentioned this is still pricing higher the nearterm any more details there as far as the cash flows in that portfolio and then what youve been buying more recently and then just the overall size of that portfolio any plans to change the size of that thanks martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp sure yeah we saw about million of cash flow come in this quarter and reprice and so that repriced up about basis points during the quarter and kind of that level is about where you can expect that over the in  its a little bit higher kind of more like million a month sorry a quarter per quarter over the next year is probably a good run rate to think about how much of that happens going forward and in terms of what were buying i mean its very similar to what we bought in the past sort of three four year duration paper that is kind of at the shorter end of the mortgage securities spectrum matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay got it thanks for that marty and then i guess i know some of the movements on the balance sheet at quarter end can be a little bit noisy but i guess the borrowing position came down pretty hard at september below billion is that a good assumption for the fourth quarter or do you have any color on that line for martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes you got two things going on there that brought that down at the end so number one that deposit growth that we had during the quarter i mean that was the big driver and so that should be durable and then second just our trading account is always up in the middle of the month and then lower at the end of the month just because thats how the mortgage backed securities settlements that cycle works so that will usually be a little bit lower end of month than average but big driver there is the deposits so that may stay that should grow you should see loan growth and so the wholesale up a little bit over time as a trend but id say that thats materially a good starting place bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats all for me guys thank you stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you matt operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to stacy kymes for closing remarks stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you everyone for joining our discussion today again
