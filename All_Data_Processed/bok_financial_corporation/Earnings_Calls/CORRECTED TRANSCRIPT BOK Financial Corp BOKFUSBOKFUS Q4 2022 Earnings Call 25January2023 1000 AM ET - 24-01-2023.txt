morning thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials fourth quarter and 2022s fullyear financial results starting on slide fourth quarter net income was million or per diluted share the strong results of the fourth quarter continue to build on the earnings momentum we have been developing throughout with the highest preprovision net revenue in our history through the fourth quarter weve now put together five straight quarters with solid core loan growth with annualized core loan growth of our fee business has remained strong for the quarter and for the year despite the worst combined equity and fixed income markets since the late as shortterm interest rates continued to rise during the quarter the combination of our asset sensitive balance sheet and growth in earning assets drove a million increase in net interest revenue and a 30basispoint linked quarter increase in the net interest margin credit also goes to our diverse fee base with linked quarter fees stable despite the full quarter impact of implementation of previously announced changes to our customer overdraft program as well as the continued effects of the mortgage origination market downturn we did experience an increase in linked quarter net chargeoffs however our asset quality trends remain unsustainably good in recognition of the strong growth in loans and unfunded commitments during the quarter we did add to our credit loss reserve the uncertainty in the economic outlook remained high with slightly less favorable key economic factors this quarter turning to slide periodend core loan balances increased million or linked quarter with growth spread across ci and commercial real estate unfunded loan commitments grew million linked quarter and have increased billion over the last months utilization rates remain slightly below historical norms so capacity exists for continued growth in outstanding balances average deposit volumes continue to remain high compared to prepandemic levels we did experience a decrease of billion or this quarter with attrition in both interestbearing and noninterestbearing balances these declines were consistent with industry trends in response to the continued efforts of the federal reserve to move shortterm rates higher to slow inflation trends assets under management or administration grew billion or linked quarter and were down billion or compared to last year the market impact on equities this year which comprise approximately a third of the total was partially offset with new sales driving the performance ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion up linked quarter total ci loans increased million or linked quarter and have increased billion or for the year with growth across all sectors unfunded ci commitments increased in linked quarter commercial real estate loans increased to million or linked quarter and have increased million or for the year this effectively returns those balances to our level after experiencing significant pay down activity in the annual increase was primarily driven from loans secured by multifamily residential properties bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 and industrial facilities unfunded commercial real estate commitments increased linked quarter we take a disciplined approach to our cre lending by allocating of tier capital and reserves to total cre commitments we are presently at the upper limit of that commitment range but do expect outstanding cre balances to grow in as construction loans spunned out healthcare balances increased slightly this quarter up million or but have increased million or for the year primarily driven by our senior housing sector healthcare unfunded commitments increased linked quarter which we expect will produce additional balanced growth energy balances increased million or linked quarter and have increased million or year overyear unfunded commitments increased linked quarter resulting in an average utilization rate of approximately creating more capacity for continued balance sheet growth general business loans recorded a strong quarter with balances increasing million or linked quarter loans in the general business category are mainly from our wholesale and retail sectors loans in our services sector also increased with balances up million or linked quarter service sector loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses including native american tribal and state and local governments as well as tribal casino operations foundations notforprofit organizations educational services and specialty trade contractors combined services and general business loans have increased million or yearoveryear unfunded commitments in these combined services and general business categories increased linked quarter slightly lowering utilization rates utilization rates continue to run below precovid levels so we remain well positioned to increase outstanding loan balances without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition over the last months core loans have grown billion or the largest annual dollar increase in our history excluding acquisitions and ppp loans although we dont expect loan growth to continue at this pace we believe that the momentum weve experienced over the past five quarters will continue as we entered and customers increase their line utilization turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies decreased million this quarter nonaccrual loans decreased million and repossessed assets fell million in consideration of strong growth and outstanding loan balances and unfunded commitments this quarter we added million to our provision for expected credit losses the level of uncertainty in the economic outlook of our reasonable and supportable forecast remained high and key economic factors were slightly less favorable to economic growth across all scenarios with our downside for cash probability weighting unchanged linked quarter at given our solid credit position today the ratio of capital allocated commercial real estate thats substantially less than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles we believe we are well positioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead we realized net chargeoffs of million during the fourth quarter essentially all related to a single credit for the full year net chargeoffs averaged basis points which is far below our historic loss range of to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to continue to be low bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarter end we expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upward as we expect strong loan growth to continue well as continue economic uncertainty due to market conditions as the fed pursues their goal of reducing inflation both of these conditions support credit provisions going forward now ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the fourth quarter relatively unchanged from last quarter however the third quarter included record high results for our commodity and hedging activities as well as our bankwide investment banking activities trading fees increased million linked quarter as we took advantage of favorable market conditions and increased market volatility our commodity and hedging activities declined million from last quarters record high with linked quarter declines in both energy and interest rate derivatives bankwide investment banking activities fell million from last quarters record high commercial loan syndication fees increased million linked quarter offset by a million decrease in other investment banking fees primarily fees from our municipal investment banking segment the combination of our investment banking and customer hedging activities from our wealth and commercial segments generated million in fee income for the year an increase of million or compared to fiduciary and asset management fees were million for the fourth quarter relatively flat linked quarter for the year these fees increased million or primarily due to reduced fund fee waivers driven by the increase in shortterm interest rates as well as market driven increases to our oil and gas fees our assets under management or administration finished the year at billion an increase of billion or linked quarter with growth across all categories our asset mix for assets under management or administration was relatively unchanged this quarter with fixed income equities cash and alternatives deposit service charges decreased million this quarter primarily related to the changes we implemented during the quarter to our overdraft program commercial service charges also decreased slightly as we increased the earnings credit rate for our customers mortgage banking revenue was million for the quarter down slightly linked quarter with production revenues down million due to a million decline in production volumes combined with narrowing margins mortgage servicing fees increased slightly this quarter and are higher than fourth quarter last year over the past months we strategically acquired servicing of approximately billion of unpaid principal balances that will add million of annual servicing revenue ill now turn over the call to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 thanks scott turning to slide fourth quarter net interest revenue was million a million increase linked quarter the rapid increase in interest rates combined with our strong loan growth in our asset sensitive position resulted in a linked quarter net interest margin expansion from to this was partially offset by the expansion of our securities portfolio which slightly dilutes the margin but increases net interest revenue the average effective rate on interestbearing deposits increased basis points this quarter bringing our total deposit beta to for the year average earning assets increase million compared to the last quarter the average available for sale security portfolio increased million this quarter as we increase that portfolio billion linked quarter to pivot back towards a more neutral interest rate position average loans increased million while cash and cash equivalents fell million on slide you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio increased to this quarter from at september total deposits decreased billion and loan balances increased million this quarter although increasing our current loantodeposit ratio remains well below the prepandemic level of at yearend providing sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity to meet future customer loan demand our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity tier1 ratio of well above regulatory thresholds it is notable that even with our strong loan growth and material unrealized losses in our available for sale securities portfolio our tangible common equity ratio remained strong at both the holding company and the bank hold investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  in the average price of per share in the open market we expect to be active in repurchasing shares over the next four quarters turning to slide linked quarter total expenses increased million million from personnel and million from nonpersonnel expense million of the personnel expense is from cashbased compensation due to increased sales activity combined with a onetime employee incentive deferred compensation expense which is directly influenced by market valuations increased million the linked quarter increase in nonpersonnel expense was primarily driven by increased professional fees and business promotion spend as well as a contribution to the bokf charitable foundation ill now turn over the call to marty grunst our incoming cfo who will provide our forward guidance marty martin e grunst executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thanks steven turning to slide ill cover our expectations for we expect mid to upper single digit annualized loan growth the economy and our geographic footprint remains very strong and may outperform in this cycle given the high level of business in migration from other markets sizable increases in unfunded commitments during and low levels of line utilization should be an additional tailwind for loan growth bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 during the fourth quarter of we added billion to our available for sale securities portfolio to move us closer to an interest rate neutral position we expect to hold the portfolio at this higher level in we have a strong base of core deposits and expect modest attrition in interestbearing and demand deposits to move our loantodeposit ratio somewhat higher while still remaining below historical levels currently we are assuming 25basispoint increases in february and march before the federal reserve pauses we believe the margin will migrate modestly lower in the first half of as interestbearing deposit betas increase demand deposit balance attrition runs its course and our interest rate position is more balanced the december net interest margin was net interest income is expected to approach billion in total for in aggregate we expect total fees and commissions revenue to approach million for we expect expenses to be below  levels in the short term migrating back towards this level throughout we continue to expect revenue growth to outpace expense growth resulting in an efficiency ratio which remains below nearing by yearend our allowance level is slightly above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality we expect quarterly provisions similar to the second half of current asset quality is very strong and does not foreshadow material deterioration changes in the economic outlook will of course impact our provision expense and we expect to continue our quarterly share repurchases as steven noted earlier ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you marty the strong fourth quarter results in fact earnings for the year demonstrate how the bank was positioned for earnings growth in this rising rate environment we leaned in to becoming more asset sensitive given the unique nature of the events causing rates to drop precipitously we chose this approach and have now moderated back to our more neutral interest rate risk profile we materially benefited from our asset sensitive balance sheet position in as well as our focus on top line revenue growth we recorded the strongest annual loan growth in our history with loan growth across the geographic footprint and across business line sectors as a result of our diverse fee base we came very close to covering the yearoveryear decline in mortgage banking fees establishing new records in our commodities and investment banking businesses last year included loan loss reserve releases of million compared to actual provision of million in a broad selection of products to our client base produced the top line revenue growth we set our focus on at the beginning of the year and has us well positioned as we start the new year credit quality continues to be very stable and better than prepandemic levels though it is likely unsustainable we continue to maintain a combined allowance above the median of our peers we are in a stage where investing in strong banks versus trading the sector are expected to matter banks with thoughtful growth a diverse business mix meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform we are well positioned for however the economy should shift favorable or negatively as we move through the incoming year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 i am proud of my teammates here at bok financial who worked very hard to deliver these strong results as we conclude id be remiss not to acknowledge my friend and our longtime cfo steven nell as this will be his last earnings call steven has been an asset to our company and served with great character we will miss his contributions we are fortunate to have such strong talent with marty grunst stepping in to fill the cfo role many of you know marty from his time as our treasurer before he became our chief risk officer with that we are pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning a good morning jared a good morning jared a good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible first like to just echo stacys comments and steve congratulations on your pending retirement and marty congratulations on the new role im looking forward to working with you in that role going forward martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thank you bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just looking at the asset sensitivity and the steps you took this quarter are you where you want to be in terms of now being more fully neutral or should we expect to see some additional moves to the securities portfolio to get there and then on the funding for that was that match funded or whats the duration on funding on that positioning martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah so jared were pretty happy with the neutral position that we got out of that increase and well continue to look at that position as the year progresses i mean thats something that we look at on a continuous basis but thats all funded with variable rate funding it has to be to generate the impact of the rate risk position so thats how that played out jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so on that trade we can expect to see maybe spread expansion as rates start to move back down later on whats the duration on the securities purchases martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah so those are our typical mortgagebacked securities and so thats kind of been that threeyear a little longer than that duration territory jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then on the loan growth it seems like theres like you said good momentum going into the year are you seeing better spreads on loans now and then also what would have to happen i guess for customers to come back in and reengage and see that utilization rate move higher as we go forward marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah okay jared this is marc maun the spread really hasnt i wouldnt say expanded but it hasnt contracted either its really just tracked ph along all year long id say its fairly consistent so we havent really seen any significant change in that as far as utilization rates go i mean focusing on the ci side i could see our cre will go up naturally just from construction loans but the ci side its more just i think a reflection of our customers have been expanding commitments at a faster rate than theyve been borrowing and i think from their cash positions and liquidity positions that they are going to expend some of that first before we start to see utilization rise but we would expect that to continue as you progress through time its still some of that that just has to be used up in the business jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 okay thanks and then just finally on capital where would you like are you focusing primarily on the tce ratio here in terms of looking at how you want to control excess capital is that the right thing for us to be focusing on and where do you think ultimately that should flow out or stabilize steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp now we range and this is steven now we range somewhere in between to of tangible common equity and thats a range that we like and thats what we look at primarily sometimes we are constrained by total capital but weve got a nice level of buybacks that youve seen over the last several quarters we continue to we think well continue to do that opportunistically use capital on that fashion pay a good dividend we raised that just a little bit in the quarter and then the rest well allocate towards loan growth and balance sheet growth to support our businesses so thats generally how we think about it jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys a good morning a good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i just wanted to ask the buyback question im a little different i mean if you look at you repurchased around of the company it was about million of stock should we expect something similar for or i mean you guys clearly have excess capital so it feels like you could do more than that potentially steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i would say probably similar i think that kind of range that youve seen quarterly which has been anywhere from million to million fits kind of that capital profile we feel like weve got that level of dollars to buy back stock and it depends on the quarter scott executes that for us and we opportunistically find a good price and well be a little more active if the price runs up well slow down a bit thats why you see that variable across those various quarters but i would anticipate a similar level of buybacks in and but again its all contingent on what the market looks like bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then bokf has for a long time been a very experienced energy and healthcare lender and its a meaningful amount of your loan book i know energy is doing great just given the pricing backdrop but yeah you start to hear of some weakness within healthcare were not seeing it in you alls numbers at all but maybe just an update on how youre thinking about your credit quality for the next couple of years out of your healthcare borrowers marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah brady this is marc we certainly are keeping our eye on the healthcare portfolio significantly because probably the headwinds there are around the labor costs associated with the senior housing industry which is the primary area we focus on and the catch up that has to happen with our medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates and which hasnt completely got there so were seeing theres a were seeing a little bit of issues with that but its something we want to keep our eye on but over time we have been weve been in this business a long time weve been very selective about who were focused on demographics favor the industry we have focused on regional operators not major chains and large operators people that have an understanding of the industry and so weve been through cycles before and we think we are comfortable with our customer selection but certainly thats the one were going to keep probably our strongest attention to in stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and i might just add if you think about that sector from my perspective over the last years its probably our lowest net chargeoff segment in our entire loan portfolio we do have criticized classified risk where because of the timing of cash flows between when operating expenses are incurred versus when they may be reimbursed from private or public payers there can be some mismatches that creates some shortterm ph criticized classified levels but if you think about it over a longer period of time the loss rates in this portfolio are exceptionally low its actually probably our best performing asset quality segment in our entire portfolio over the last years brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then finally for me bokf has done a great job of growing fiduciary and asset management fees i mean if i look at it over multiple years its just been a great source of revenue growth for you guys how should i mean not necessarily next quarter or even next year but as we look out for the next couple of years should we continue to expect bokf to see this nice revenue growth in that segment scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp sure so this is scott we feel good about really the fact that not just our asset mix which is very well diversified between fixed income equity alternatives but a healthy midteen percentage of cash which now is obviously serving us well in terms of fee generation of money market funds both our proprietary and others that we utilize so thats been nice to get that momentum and revenue generation back but were really seeing significant progress in growing assets across all the various business lines inside of wealth management as well as in the various customer segments that we serve bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 so we continue to be optimistic and feel good about how were positioned to continue to see that segment grow given our account new account attraction of assets with probably less market exposure and decline than many others do that have a more skewed asset mix than us so were very optimistic about it yes indiscernible differentiate is there a little bit is if you think about both the pandemic and the decline and asset value during that period of time and then last year were both fixed income and equity markets declined really for the first time since the way we deliver into that segment through a very personalized approach people value that so if some in the market are moving more towards automated approaches or things like that the ability to have a touch point to talk to an advisor to talk about strategy and to reassure folks in difficult market circumstances the value of that is much higher today than perhaps in previous periods because of the volatility thats been experienced and we think thats a differentiator for us in the long term to help us grow this asset base brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great well thanks for the color and steven great working with you good luck in retirement steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you very much brady operator our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp morning a morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and congrats steven steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and marty its been a while but looking forward to it martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp right yeah looking forward to it as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah back to the midwest i guess but can you guys help us a little bit on the cadence of the margin you kind of allude to it a little bit in your guidance and i know youre focused more on nii but youre saying modestly lower until maybe some of the deposit rate and flow pressures ease but does it fit what kind of erosion are you talking about early in the year and do you think it can maybe stabilize and float higher later in the year martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah so jon this is marty ill take that so our rate risk position is now pretty neutral to a rate increase and we do think well get a rate increase or two early in the year and that might be modestly beneficial just at least initially the securities portfolio will continue to reprice higher so those are kind of the positives there deposit mix shift is of course going to be the counterbalance as that kind of plays out and loan growth thatll be supportive for net interest revenue but just ever so slightly dilutive to margin so its not at all clear exactly how that shakes out timing wise but that should result in some modest decline in margin and nothing thats really significant one way or the other jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay got it thats helpful so not material changes maybe marc or stacy like i wrote down a couple of quotes marc you said should an economic slowdown materialize and stacy you said credit is unsustainably good so help us understand where your heads are at in terms of what youve seen on credit and it doesnt feel like youre signifying any kind of material slowdown in loan growth or am i wrong on that stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp this is stacy i think its interesting to listen to the market fundings over the last six months from theres a deep recession coming to a soft recession to now a soft landing yeah i dont think any of us know with any level of precision what the future holds weve got a deeply inverted yield curve but were also coming off a pandemic thats unprecedented and so all of the economic metrics that people are accustomed to trying to use to predict those types of economic outcomes are probably not as reliable our viewpoint is if you think that were going to have a soft landing and were going to grow weve demonstrated our ability to grow we grew loans organically this year billion were in a great footprint and were well positioned for growth if the economy does achieve a soft landing our footprint is much better than most bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 but if your view is that there will be a recession then there will be more likely credit deterioration then were one of the best performing credit banks in the regional banks space the largest bank in united states that didnt participate in tarp our credit performance through the last meaningful downturn materially outperformed our peers credit is hard to forecast we typically will say the next six months are pretty easy to see after about six months the ph lends gets really foggy but as we look forward from here our classified loans are down our potential problem loans are down and our accrual loans are down were starting from an incredibly low point and so even some migration up wouldnt necessarily even indicate a deterioration really in longterm credit trends really just a movement from abnormally low levels and so i dont know that any of us want to forecast exactly what we think is going to happen because nobody really knows but if its a growth scenario were going to perform well if its a credit event that people are worried about then i think our credit history and our discipline around that will serve us very well if that is the scenario that has people concerned jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so the view from ph tulsa is not armageddon its just stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp not ph we i mean i think our view even when people were forecasting a recession was that its entirely likely that our footprint think about dallas houston denver phoenix whats happening in those markets that there may be a level of material outperformance in our core markets then there may be in the rest of the country if there is a recession because the level of inmigration into these markets is significant and the economic growth thats happening is far outpacing the national economy so even when the general consensus was theres going to be a recession we thought that we would be in a much better position just because of that footprint but were not seeing anything today in discussions with our borrowers and our own data that would indicate that we think theres a recession thats imminent jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks guys i appreciate it good luck steven steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from matt olney with stephens inc please proceed matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning on the brokerage and trading line i think the slide deck attributed higher levels of trading from elevated margins any more color on the drivers of that higher margin how sustainable is that into bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp well this is scott so we saw in all of the fixed income markets with the market volatility that stacy alluded to we saw unprecedented volatility in the fourth quarter but we continue to see with the level of rate uncertainty thats out there in the marketplace good spread capability were nimble and have a reasonably well diversified product mix inside of the fixed income arena so we think that until theres an abatement of the uncertainty in the market volatility will continue to enjoy better margins there matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay appreciate that and then going back to deposits and funding pretty big material outflow of demand deposits in fourth quarter and were seeing this across the industry and it sounds like the guidance you put out there assumes continued pressure here im curious what your expectations are and within the guidance when do you expect that to stabilize martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah this is marty let me give you a little color there so yeah our guidance does our loantodeposit ratio comes up some over and it presumes that our cumulative beta on deposits continues to increase somewhat over to accommodate the retention of our interestbearing deposits the dda attrition we see that more in the first part of the year any of these attrition factors they either burn out or conditions change and its no longer relevant thats kind of how we think about the outlook there stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp matt this is stacy i think that weve seen commentary in the markets around the deposit attrition in the industry broadly i think a couple of things that are unique about us that i think need to be brought out number one is were starting from a much lower loantodeposit ratio than most of our peers in the space and we in the fourth quarter low of loantodeposit ratio steven and i were talking we run this bank at upper low for a long time thats typically much more normal and so that starting point gave us the ability to manage this liquidity and margin and were actively doing that we also have a lot of stored liquidity thats effectively off balance sheet through our broker dealer and our wealth group where funds that have left our balance sheet have gone to other sources that are controlled through our broker dealer or wealth group thats in the event that we need liquidity in a future period can be brought back at the right price so its not something that we see is necessarily problematic its something that were actually actively managing and watching to optimize for our shareholders matt olney q analyst stephens inc yes okay appreciate that stacy and i guess just kind of staying on this topic here in the fourth quarter i mean the funding plan was obviously some borrowings to kind of plug the hole and stacy you mentioned some of the store liquidity that you could use this some time but it didnt sound like thats a nearterm event so what is the plan i guess for funding at least for the first half of the year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah so we would see both a stabilization in the overall deposit trends and some usage of wholesale really throughout the year on the wholesale side as you know the vast majority of our securities portfolio is us government agencies which are ideal for pledging to fhlb and its really normal for us to have fhlb funding as a core part of our overall funding base i mean that goes back years so its really the recent couple of years that are the anomaly and eventually were all going to get to normal balance sheet profile at some point stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp remember matt i mean prepandemic we always viewed deposits funded the loan book and the securities book was selffunding through other mechanism whether itd be fhlb or repo or other activities and thats the way we ran the bank for years and so were just kind of coming back to that deposits didnt bond loans and securities historically its only been in the last really couple of three years where thats happened were still billion higher in deposits today than we were december of so weve got to put some of this in perspective based upon the longterm perspective not just based on a pandemic viewpoint matt olney q analyst stephens inc yes yes fully agree okay thanks guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to steven for closing comments steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director
