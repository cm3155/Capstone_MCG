it pertains to any forwardlooking statements we make during this call ill now turn the call over to steve bradshaw bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter financial results this quarter was another in which our fee businesses highlighted the effectiveness of our diversified revenue strategy as we eclipsed million in net income for the first time in the history of our company shown on slide third quarter net income was million or per diluted share that represents eps growth of over from the same quarter a year ago a remarkable outcome given todays very different economic environment the key items that drove our success this quarter were a fourth consecutive record revenue quarter from our wealth management business another exceedingly strong production and margin quarter from our mortgage team no credit loss provision was needed this quarter net interest margin was stable due primarily to an increase in acceleration that we will detail momentarily with additional support from highly disciplined deposit pricing and an increase in the effectiveness of floors in our commercial loan book and lastly we have diligently controlled expenses from the outset of the business impact brought about by covid19 turning to slide while average loans were flat this quarter average deposits were up over linked quarter and up nearly from the same quarter a year ago due primarily to customers retaining higher balances in this current economic environment assets under management or in custody were up nearly linked quarter and yearoveryear again topping billion we attribute the growth to positive market movement along with better results in the quarter from active sales and asset retention efforts ill provide some additional perspective on the results before the start of the qa session but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over now to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp thanks steve turning to slide periodend loans were billion down for the quarter small pockets of growth in our healthcare book was offset by pay downs in energy and across our core commercial and industrial loan book some of this was continued repayment of defensive draws and some of this was through the organic decline in economic activity and purposeful deleveraging by our customers looking specifically at energy loans they contracted for the quarter commodity prices while improving still make new deals difficult to source in the current environment that we remain optimistic about our ability to enhance market share longterm energy borrowers continue to pay down debt to reduce leverage at this point in the cycle despite these factors we remain open for business and continue to support our customers in the energy industry this business is more than just lending activities as evidenced by the record energy derivatives revenue this quarter as customers continue to aggressively manage their commodity risk commercial real estate loan balances were up from the previous quarter largely due to continued friction in a permanent financing market slowing the level of pay down activity looking forward our outlook for loan growth for the rest of the year remains tempered the speed and shape of the broader economic recovery will be the determining factor in restarting loan growth we are optimistic that once precovid normalcy returns to the economy we are wellpositioned in our commercial lending portfolio to grow loans bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 turning to slide we supply the look into the loan deferral status across bokfs portfolio as you can see just of total loans remain in deferral status of any type at the peak that figure was of total loans so we are happy to say that more than of the loans that were deferred have now moved back to regular payment status of the loans that remain in deferral status roughly half are in the commercial real estate portfolio these are being closely monitored but shortterm the credit quality has held in better than our original expectations longterm outcomes will be dependent on the pace of economic recovery and the impact of any additional fiscal stimulus also on slide weve again compiled a list of loan segments we consider more exposed to the economic impact of the pandemic this group of loans is highly diversified with over loans for an average loan size of less than million clearly the million retail portion of this portfolio remains the most vulnerable today and well continue monitoring these exposures closely in the coming months while office and multifamily may see impacts here we believe our geographic footprint will help us in these segments in the longterm because of the strong and migration over time turning to slide you can see that credit quality remains stable as witnessed by our lack of credit loss provision this quarter as we mentioned last quarter we felt the material reserve build would be largely complete assuming our economic forecast is in line going forward looking at the underlying components a million provision related to lending activities was offset by a decrease in the accrual for expected credit losses for mortgage banking activities and allowance for credit losses from investment securities changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables primarily due to an improved economic outlook related to the anticipated impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other assumptions resulted in a million decrease in the provision for credit losses from lending activities changes in the loan portfolio characteristics including specific impairment and losses loan balances and risk grading resulted in a million increase in the provision for credit losses from lending activities net chargeoffs of million or basis points annualized is slightly above last quarter excluding ppp loans net chargeoffs were basis points annualized yeartodate net chargeoffs totaled million or basis points annualized well within our companys historical loss experience the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at september compared to million or of outstanding loans last quarter the combined allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was of outstanding energy loans at september nonaccruing energy loans decreased million this quarter attributed almost entirely to a decrease in non accruing energy loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarterend down slightly from million at june a decrease in potential problem energy loans was partially offset by an increase in general business loans and commercial real estate loans just a quick note on energy credit that is currently the largest driver of overall asset quality for the company the second quarter of was an imperfect storm for the semiannual borrowing base redetermination process given the impacts to supply from opec plus and demand from covid19 all hit in the midst of this process for borrowers even had time to react to manage their response the result was a higher level of negative credit migration while commodity prices rose in the third quarter to a level that we expect to improve the credit outlook we do not upgrade credit in a ph wholesale manner solely based on commodity price changes as we go through the semiannual redetermination process in the fourth quarter we would expect positive credit migration if prices remain stable at these levels bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 ill now turn the call over to highlight our nim dynamics fee revenues and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy with record net income this quarter is clearly another fantastic one for the company pre provision net revenue topped million for the second consecutive time demonstrating the full earnings power of the company net interest revenue strength net interest margin defense outsized fee revenue and diligent expense management all contributed to our success this quarter as noted on slide net interest income was million diligent expense management all contributed to our success this quarter as noted on slide net interest income was million down just over million from last quarter ppp loan fee recognition contributed million this quarter versus million last quarter additionally due to loan payoffs and adjustments for acquired loans discount accretion was million this quarter versus only million last quarter net interest margin was compared to in the previous quarter lower loan yields in the neared zero rate environment were offset primarily by the acceleration of discount accretion from cobiz acquired loans which supported net interest margin by basis points versus last quarter and it is expected to normalize next quarter additional support was provided by an 8basispoint reduction in interestbearing deposit costs down to basis points and an increased effectiveness of floors in our commercial loan book as average libor continue to fall in the current quarter turning to slide clearly earnings this quarter was bolstered dramatically by million in revenues from our fee businesses as our wealth management and mortgage teams have continued their momentum to post outstanding quarters elevated margin in mortgage reflect the continued lack of industry capacity given the strong demand in the current low rate environment mortgage production revenue remains high just slightly below the prior quarter refinances accounted for of total originated this quarter down from our wealth management team put together a fourth consecutive record total revenue quarter predating the low rate environment we find ourselves in today this quarter with a host of complementary business units we saw incredible deposit growth of over linked quarter significant financial marketbased investment management fees and risk management revenues and great synergies with commercial banking through the insurance arm acquired by cobiz altogether exceptional performance and scott can provide additional detail during the questionandanswer session brokerage and trading revenue increased million with commissions increasing million we continue to see elevated mortgagebacked security trading activity out of our connecticut office derivative fees and commissions increased million primarily due to the increased hedging activity from our energy clients a result of our expertise in that lending vertical investment banking revenue increased million primarily due to the increased syndication fees as we look forward to the team is adjusting strategy to overcome the decline in fees from traditional cash investments that are now paying close to zero providing further optimism for continued growth fee revenue now represents of total revenue up from in the same quarter last year this once again demonstrates an bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 important differentiating characteristic of bok financial we have long had a diverse revenue mix that provides an earnings buffer in economic downturns because of the countercyclical nature of some of these fee revenue streams the net economic benefit of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was million during the quarter including a million increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights million increase in the fair value of securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge and million related net interest revenue turning to slide expense management remains prudent with an increase of just under million we have managed personnel costs by holding the line on adding new positions and challenged the need to fill open positions together these actions worked to decrease regular compensation about million this quarter while this will moderate a bit as our branch network has now opened we have revised our branch strategy to a hybrid model this new model will continue to meet the needs of our client but recognizes that the pandemic has accelerated customer behavior adoption of technology and we will need to fewer staff in locations to meet future need this is a change we recognized early in the pandemic and we were able to make real steps towards efficiency in fact looking at head count we have absorbed approximately positions companywide were almost of our personnel base since march simply through attrition and increased efficiency elsewhere in personnel expense incentive compensation increased million due to a million increase in cashbased incentive compensation resulting from higher fee revenues and million largely related to vesting assumptions regarding the companys earnings per share growth relative to a defined peer group these increases were offset partially by a million increase in deferred compensation looking at the million increase in nonpersonnel expense there were several offsetting components writedowns on a set of oil and gas properties and a retail commercial real estate property professional fees and data processing expense were partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment expense and other expenses in addition the second quarter included a charitable contribution to the bokf foundation of million on slide our liquidity position remains very strong given the continued inflow of deposit balances our loanto deposit ratio is now compared to at june providing significant on balance sheet liquidity to meet future customer needs our capital position levels remain strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of an improvement from last quarter and well ahead of our internal operating range minimum on slide ill leave you with some general outlook for the near and midterm that might be helpful our loan growth is expected to be soft in the nearterm however as we put together our budget with the expectation of economic recovery well be looking for opportunities to grow loan once again in our available for sale securities portfolio which is largely agency mortgagebacked securities yielded during the third quarter given the sustained low rate environment prepayments could reach approximately million per quarter we can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around basis points to basis points as we noted we have had success during the third quarter driving deposit costs down further were now below the low point reached during the last near zero rate environment we believe there is room to push a bit floor over the next couple of quarters though we feel we are nearing a bottom to deposit cost the combination on the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 normalization of elevated discount accretion pressure on asset yields and less room to lower deposit cost will put some pressure on net interest margin our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue pressure being felt in the spread businesses we expect our brokerage and trading activity to continue at elevated levels given our ability to monetize every part of the fixed income space our mortgage business should remain solid from continued low rates and housing demand with perhaps some normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non personnel cost will continue as noted earlier weve made good progress through the pandemic we have no plans for a direct reduction of workforce or any corporatewide program to cut existing capabilities or products for our customers we will have our look for all opportunities to gain efficiency through automation and process improvement although there remains uncertainty in the economic environment we continue to believe the loan loss reserve building is behind us as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength we will maintain our quarterly cash dividends and have plans to restart opportunistic share buybacks ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you the differentiator earnings outcome that our strict credit discipline and heavily feebased revenue model produces during times of uncertainty cant be overstated here as youve seen our fee income streams have produced over million in revenue so far this year and we believe that strength will continue as we have never seen clients with a higher appreciation for advice than in todays uncertain economy business owners mortgage holders wealth management clients corporations all are facing significant financial decisions as they plan for our relationship driven business model is really in the sweet spot between high touch and high tech it is perfectly in touch with the needs of clients today we continue to expand existing relationships and acquire new customers as we believe individuals and companies are clearly evaluating how well their financial partners did or did not help during the last eight months bok financial is uniquely positioned to win incremental market share and that will be our focus heading into with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question has come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks good morning everyone steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning indiscernible ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess my first my first question is for stacy if you do seek positive credit migration in the fall redetermination process as you expect would that actually lead to a release of reserves or is that already in your cecl expectations stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp theres so many different assumptions that go into how i mean part of that would be what do our updated economic outlook look like what other credit migration may be happening in other aspects of the portfolio i think its difficult at this point to try to have conjecture around what we think positive credit migration would do to reserve levels as we think about the fourth quarter i think generally speaking we if you think about the allowance you probably want to get into some level of postcovid or vaccine environment where you have a lot more transparency around what the environment is going to look like because you think itd be difficult to try to do something there and then have the economic environment turn against you i think we feel very good about where we are today obviously but i think it would be early to summarize what could happen with the positive credit migration and energy ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay it helps and then in terms of the brokerage and trading side obviously your fee income guidance implies the fees are going to remain strong and i think steven you mentioned that brokerage is going to remain high i guess thats been kind of going straight up over the last couple of quarters its been very strong results what is it about brokerage and trading that keeps it high at this level going forward scott bradley grauer q executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp hi ken this is scott grauer so let me let me take a stab at that were when you think about our trading and brokerage activity while we get probably a lot of headline attention to our mortgagebacked securities piece bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 which is a significant component its roughly a third of that revenue that being said our activity with mortgage originators is really only about its or so weve had real strong activity in our downstream correspondent financial institution business our activity to asset managers has been very strong and then our other component pieces weve had significant momentum building in our cmo activity from a products standpoint weve had good activity with our investment banking our municipal underwriting and as stacy mentioned our hedging activity has been very strong so its been really across the board in all of our activities in the brokerage and trading piece and our asset values have rebounded since the recovery in the equity markets our recurring fee business which is roughly even on the brokerage side are back to premarch levels so its strong across the board ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and just one really quick last question in terms of your expense guidance you said its going to be roughly at the same level sort of last few quarters if i got my numbers right it looks like expenses are kind of going up quite a bit over the last few quarters are you talking more in line with or in line sort of with the average which is lower than steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp given the kind of change in revenue mix more towards the fee side relative to the spread businesses youre just going to have a slightly higher expense base to support that revenue stream so i think going forward youll see its similar to what we had in the third quarter here ken we did have one item where we caught up if you will our incentive compensation accruals because of our positioning around where we fall within the peer group so we needed to catch that accrual up but also we didnt put any dollars into our community foundation and so we may do that in the fourth quarter you may not have the catch up on the incentive comp component for the stock based compensation but you may have a little bit higher contribution to our foundation so all those things may wash out and end up at an expense level similar to what you had in the third quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you very much operator thank you our next question has come from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your questions brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys a indiscernible brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i wanted to ask about share buybacks it sounds like you guys will be active in that headed into yearend stocks at times tangible you have a decent amount of excess capital i mean im looking back at where you bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 guys have repurchased stock in the past and its over a share the stock now sub60 so how aggressive do you think youll be on the buyback front this quarter and into next year steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah well youre exactly right brady when i look back the three quarters preceding the last two where we didnt buy any stock back and we averaged about  at so you would have to expect we would be as aggressive if not more given the current stock price and given the capital levels were stronger now than they were back then and we feel pretty comfortable with the credit side as stacy mentioned so i think you would expect us to be at that level or more aggressive in the fourth quarter and then well just see where we roll out in i dont want to make any provide any guidance around what we would do in but certainly i think youll see us back in the market brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then moving on to the margin i mean you talked about seeing some pressure on the margin obviously with the accretable yield from cobiz normalizing that will push the margin down on its own but excluding any sort of movements from accretable yield how much pressure would you expect on the net interest margin going forward steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well let me just take a few of the components i really think our loan pricing is kind of adjusted i mean i dont expect that to be to go down any further also our lending groups stacy norm bagwell others have been able to get some floors in on about to or so of our portfolio and thats supporting the margins so i feel pretty good about where our loan pricing is i mentioned deposit costs i think we can push those down a little bit more i dont know how far i wouldnt commit that we could pass through basis points but were at ph average for the third quarter the last month of the quarter was a little better than that i think we can keep pushing there some i think where youll see the margin pressure is from our available for sale securities portfolio where youve got as you would expect some pretty sizable cash flows from that portfolio i mentioned i think million a quarter that will come out of a portfolio yield of ph and roll into securities that we reinvest between basis points and basis points so you can kind of do the math around that and figure out that youve got some roll down in net interest margin in the next few quarters so that maybe ill leave it at that brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then finally for me i just wanted to ask about the expense base im guessing at some point all the success youre having on the fee income side will start to decline so maybe next year as you start to see fees not be as strong are there continued opportunities you have on the expense base to help offset any pressure on profitability i know you mentioned youve already allowed the workforce to be reduced by do you think theres more work to be done on the expense side next year steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 yeah brady this is steve bradshaw id say that thats an absolute focus for us and it became significant for us really going all the way back to midmarch when we returned to a near zero paid environment we understand the implications of that we have a playbook from that not to in the nottoodistant past when we had the same scenario and youre right weve used attrition to bring that workforce down weve done some targeted reductions where weve seen efficiencies currently doing that in our branch network theres other areas that were focused on as well so that is going to be critical i think for us in and the good work weve done has been a little bit masked because to stevens point when you see outsized performance from mortgage you see outsized performance from brokerage and trading those are both commissionbased compensation businesses youre going to pay for that and were happy to pay for that and thats going to be reflected in personnel costs when you strip that away and weve got a very positive trend line in reducing some of our costs in that fashion if were going to continue that into so its not like were just waking up today to address that this is something that weve been working on as a management team for seven months brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question has come from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc stacy for you back on slide can you talk a little bit about how granular the energy nonaccruals are and also some of the potential problem loans is it a handful of larger credits or is it more broadbased than that stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp no i mean energy overall tends to queue to a higher average loan size and so there is probably a higher average loan size embedded in both potential problem loans to a lesser extent than nonaccruals generally by the time they make it that far youve had a couple of borrowing base reductions and they tend to be a little bit smaller by the time they get to that point but were very optimistic about kind of at this fall redetermination season we feel good about potential loss content embedded here we fared exceptionally well if you look at i think yeartodate were last five quarters weve kind of been in that 27basispoint range and that feels very good particularly given what weve been through but even without that that would be a good number for us so i feel good about kind of where we are from a loss content perspective there doesnt mean there wont be more i bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 certainly would expect there to be some level of additional loss content embedded there as we work through those problems but we feel good about the outlook for sure jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay that helps and then steven maybe another way of getting back at kens earlier question but what would have to happen to drive a higher provision or to get you back into positive territory it seems like loan balances are maybe a little flattish in the nearterm and weve got some credit improvement but what would have to happen you guys to go back to a positive provision steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think youd have to have an economic outlook that deteriorates more than we have a base case upside case and a downside case and i think you would have to have much more the downside case out in expectation for next year or early part of next year that would throw you back into a scenario where you needed to provide for expected losses in a scenario like that perhaps some more deterioration on the energy side but were not seeing that at this stage so i think it really drives more around the economic outlook backing up and deteriorating significantly from what we have in our estimates today jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and then one last small one i dont know if you touched on it but do you have the mortgage pipeline and maybe how that looks today steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no i dont have that in front of me ive got what the origination activity was third quarter versus second it was just slightly lower not much but a little bit lower theres always some seasonality even in these very low rates that have driven a lot of origination activity you still have a slowdown in the fourth quarter generally thats what weve seen in the past thats why i noted that we think mortgage will stay relatively strong but with some seasonal kind of slowdown the margins have held up very very well in fact they were up basis points all the way to ph i believe for this quarter i dont know if that will hold up forever but certainly were seeing still very good activity in the mortgage company during the fourth quarter here jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks a lot guys i appreciate it operator thank you our next question has come from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hi this this is brandon king on for jenny how are you guys doing bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey so most of my questions have been answered but i wanted to touch on loan growth and i saw that there was growth in the healthcare senior housing and senior care and i was wondering if you could provide more details on underlying trends of that and expectations for fourth quarter and possibly even in stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp sure so healthcare has been an obviously a strong focus for our company for a long time weve got a fantastic team thats focused there the two really three areas that we focus on are our hospital systems and thats generally large highend credit hospital systems medical and physicians practice groups and senior housing and we see opportunity for growth really particularly in the latter two we saw growth in hospital systems in the first half of the year as they worked to obtain additional liquidity to work through the pandemic i think what we would expect to see over the next year or so is that need lessens that there need for liquidity would lessen and so their need for credit would probably lessen as well or at least their draw downs we see good opportunity inside of our healthcare group both the medical and physicians group as well as the senior housing group i think that what weve seen in the growth in the nearterm has been as weve talked about in the past some of the large reits that have struggled may divest of certain property sets and so we have some clients who are the operators of those properties and maybe they sold them their reit originally many years ago they continue to operate them they know the facility they know the health dynamics of that facility so theyre very comfortable purchasing that facility out of the reit and so thats created some opportunities for growth from us with existing clients with existing properties that they operate and so thats been part of the growth that weve seen here in the third quarter and we think particularly once we get through the pandemic that will continue to be a very strong opportunity for growth for us and were very happy with our growth in our medical and physicians practice group we really that was a big part of the acquisition from cobiz for us on the healthcare front and they really exceeded expectations and continued to have high expectations from that team as we move forward brandon king q analyst truist securities inc awesome and other than healthcare are there any other areas of growth that you could be looking to capitalize on going into next year i know loan demand is pretty soft right now but are there any particular areas outside of healthcare that you could be looking to take any market share opportunity there stacy c kymes a executive vice president corporate banking bok financial corp look i think that from our perspective growth will be tempered until such time is people are very comfortable in the economic environment and i think that probably is into a widely available vaccine but i will tell you i think that the response that weve seen from our customer base around our customer service and responsiveness particularly around ppp i think our opportunities to grow in all aspects of our lending once the economy begins to grow i mean if we were growing loans in a big way right now you guys would probably be questioning and bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 challenging how we were doing that and where that growth was coming from but i think when the economy turns were exceptionally wellpositioned because our customers have realized that having a trusted advisor and having a person they can talk to when they need credit and when they need to work through an issue is worth a lot to them and so im very optimistic about our growth prospects once we get to the kind of proverbial other side of this pandemic brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay that is great thats all i had thank you very much steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your questions gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks guys good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co i wanted to ask a question on energy and i appreciate the positive comments regarding the upcoming redetermination season but i was curious in terms of borrowers that may have had shortfalls after the spring redetermination how successful have they been in correcting those or is really maybe some increase in the borrowing base in the fall going to be the more positive driver of that stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp well i mean its hard to answer that because weve probably only been through about to of the redeterminations at this point and so in many cases the last time we saw them was in the spring when the prices were significantly lower in the meantime theyve done things to manage their business reduce costs in some cases theyve shut in wells in the early stages that theyll bring back online so i think its a little bit premature to answer that with a lot of clarity until weve been through this fall redetermination cycle but based on the credits that we have seen through that process i think were optimistic that between a positive price movement and actions of the borrower that were going to work through this in a very positive manner and we dont see lost content in that portfolio thats inconsistent with what youve seen from us in the past gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 okay thank you and then just on ppp unless i missed it in the press release anywhere can you tell us what the fees were that were recognized in the third quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yes gary this is steven the fees were million that we recognized in the third quarter for ppp gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp youre welcome operator thank you our next question has come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp hi peter indiscernible peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc obviously credit is a good story i was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the retail side that you guys called out that you are watching a little bit more closely stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp yeah id certainly invite marc to provide color here as well today were not seeing real big issues there were calling in it out as a risk area because its intuitive and we see that from that perspective but i think in my comments i mentioned that its held up better than we would have expected knowing what we know now and given the depth of the pandemic in various markets so were not necessarily seeing credit migration there today as much as we are calling it out as a potential risk area in fact as we dig through that and as you can imagine bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 weve spent a lot of time in the last days doing that and we actually feel much better about it than we did when this all kind of started and we began to kind of call out some of these higher risk areas marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah this is marc what id only add is that from a loan deferral standpoint weve had twothirds of our consumer loans and mortgage loan exit from that deferral program so and they tend to have a little longer request and a little longer ability than most so weve had very good success in having those migrate back to regular payments peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and then if i can just confirm on the provision expense outlook steven so the way to think about it is kind of a zero provision for the next several quarters assuming no further deterioration in the economy steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well thats kind of what we see i mean i weve made the statement that we feel like the reserve build is behind us we made that statement last quarter that if the economic environment stayed relatively stable which it did in fact it improved a little bit that weve felt like we wouldnt have to build a reserve anymore thats kind of the stance we have now who knows what will change and i answered the question earlier in this call that if the economic environment and outlook deteriorate significantly then yeah we got to go back and run our models and determine if theres more expected loss there but today were not seeing that peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and just my final question for steve i was just wondering if you can give an update on what your thoughts are of ma bank ma in this environment steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah peter i dont think our stance really changes there were always interested in quality organizations especially areas that we can expand within our existing footprint as you know we like the market that were in very much weve got some good growth markets where we dont have substantial market share and we could benefit from extra scale i think realistically in this environment highquality banks are not as likely to be sellers with the uncertain credit outlook with the low rates and maybe ph calling margins if you were an owner of a good quality bank you probably dont see that as the greatest opportunity to maximize the value of your bank youre probably going to see more scratch and dent type transactions and while we look at those from time to time weve typically not gone down that route because our belief and i say this with confidence and not arrogance is that id rather have the management team focused on growing our own organization which weve had great success doing and trying to turn around a bad situation in an uncertain environment so we remain interested and focused on that as we think about going forward but i think that the opportunity that we have will probably be limited here in nearterm bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2020 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc
