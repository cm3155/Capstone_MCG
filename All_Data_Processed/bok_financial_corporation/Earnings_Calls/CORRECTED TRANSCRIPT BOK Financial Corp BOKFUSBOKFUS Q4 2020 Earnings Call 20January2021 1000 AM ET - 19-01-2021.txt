slide pertaining to any forwardlooking statements we make during the call ill now turn the call over to steve bradshaw steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and fullyear financial results in summary despite a year punctuated with hurdles it would be difficult to overstate the flexibility and persistence our organization demonstrated this past year a record million in pretax preprovision revenue for proved once again the strength of our diversified revenue strategy and the stability it provides during times of economic stress more importantly it underscores the breadth of our service capabilities and the value that we provide our customers starting on slide fullyear net income was million or per diluted share looking specifically at the fourth quarter net income was a record million or per diluted share representing eps growth of in a linkedquarter basis and thats more than from the same quarter a year ago the key items that drove our success this quarter were starting another outstanding broadbased earnings quarter from our wealth management business continued elevated production from our mortgage team though at a decreased level from the last two quarters as seasonality and modest margin compression materialized following the summers mortgage boom but mortgage margins remained strong relevant to the firsthalf of no credit loss provision was needed this quarter and in fact the improving economic outlook combined with improving credit trend allowed us to release million of our reserve and lastly the proactive measures we took to control expense levels at the outset of the pandemic in march served us well in the fourth quarter as it did for all of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 turning to slide loan growth remained a challenge this quarter as our borrowers understandably reduced leverage in the challenging economic environment stacy will cover this in more detail momentarily but we do believe growth opportunities will resume in as the economy continues to rebound deposit growth remains excellent up over linkedquarter and up over from the same quarter a year ago those figures did not include the second wave of stimulus enacted late in so we anticipate this trend to continue in the nearterm assets under management or in custody were up over for the quarter topping billion for the first time in our companys history on very strong new client sales and favorable market impact well dive a little deeper in the record year our wealth management team produced in as well as a shift of some brokerage and trading fee revenue into net interest revenue due to an increase in trading securities balances and settlement timing in the fourth quarter needless to say we are incredibly proud of our wealth management division ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp thanks steve turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion down for the quarter as steve mentioned quality borrowers reduced leverage in times of economic uncertainty which has been the case with our borrowers again this quarter looking at the energy portfolio balances contracting for the quarter and for the year while commodity prices have improved considerably over the last few months sourcing new deals sufficient to offset paydowns in the current environment remains a challenge as the existing borrowers continue to pay down debt to reduce leverage despite these factors we remain optimistic for lending and energyrelated revenue growth heading into the new year as we continue to support our customers in this space remember our diversified revenue strategy allow us to look at clients holistically and the energy business is far more than just lending as witnessed by the record level of energy hedging revenue this year treasury retirement plan services and personal wealth management are all businesses that continue to grow and serve our energy client base healthcare balances were down slightly this quarter as growth in senior housing loans was offset by a decrease in hospital system loans for the year though healthcare loans were up yearoveryear primarily due to growth in balances from our hospital systems clients who demonstrate a strong credit profile looking forward we remain confident in our healthcare portfolios longterm growth and credit outlook and expect it to be a growth leader once again after the health and economic conditions migrate to a more normal state in the near term it should be pointed out that the second stimulus bill passed last month like the original cares act has multiple revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the current environment paycheck protection program or ppp balances declined nearly as just over million of balances were forgiven in the quarter the forgiveness process initially was more complex than we believed it would be at the beginning of ppp in april of however additional guidance from the small business administration or sba clarifying our requirements and continued refinement of our processes has significantly reduced the time required bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 per application the largest hurdle in recent months has been clients reluctance to apply for forgiveness as they were hopeful of legislative action that would relax the requirements the recent economic aid act will provide substantial forgiveness process relief especially for those clients with existing ppp loans of less than which represents more than of our total ppp volume we will participate in the newest round of ppp with largely the same strategy of focusing on our existing client base this will allow us to leverage additional resource capacity to meet our existing client needs in an extremely timely manner thereby increasing client engagement loyalty and retention looking ahead we are optimistic in our outlook for loan growth for the speed and shape of the broader economic recovery will be the determining factor in restarting loan growth however we are wellpositioned to serve clients and believe confidence and resulting capital investment will return in turning to slide youll see an updated view of the loan deferral status across the bokf portfolio as you can see just of total loans remain in a deferral status of any type down from last quarter of the loans that remain in deferral status very few loans totaling million are in extended deferral this increasingly small portfolio of loans is closely monitored but short term the credit quality has continued to migrate positively long term outcomes will be dependent on the pace of economic recovery and the impact of additional fiscal stimulus also on slide weve again compiled the list of loan segments the markets originally considered more exposed to ongoing economic headwinds due to the pandemic this group of loans is highly diversified with over loans for an average loan size of less than million the million retail portion of this portfolio remains the most vulnerable today and well continue monitoring these exposures closely that said the retail portion of our loan portfolio has held up better than expectations as our borrowers have proved resilient significant portions of this list were originally considered more vulnerable are performing very well including gaming convenience stores religious organizations and colleges turning to slide you can see that credit quality has improved significantly since the firsthalf of not only were we able to release a portion of the loan loss reserve but we also saw a significant credit quality improvement in our energy portfolio as we completed our borrowing base redetermination process in the quarter the rebound and nearterm stability in commodity prices resulted in reduced criticized and potential problem loan numbers along with our needed reserve allocation to energy loans net chargeoffs were down from million or basis points annualized in the third quarter to million or basis points annualized this quarter net chargeoffs totaled basis points well within our companys historical loss experience the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at quarterend excluding ppp loans the combined allowance for loan losses attributed to energy was of outstanding energy loans on december nonaccruing loans increased slightly by million this quarter primarily due to an increase in nonaccruing commercial real estate loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarterend down significantly from million on september looking ahead from a credit perspective theres still a lot of uncertainty in the current environment so it remains difficult to predict too far out that said based on what we know today and assuming our economic forecast is in line as we advance we believe net chargeoffs will remain on the lower end of the range of our historical average of to basis points we will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 we are generally positive about the credit outlook in allowing us to begin a reserve release this quarter once we have more clarity around the speed of covid19 case count reductions vaccine distribution and a broad resumption of regular economic activity in we could potentially see additional opportunity for reserve release this year ill now turn the call over to steven to highlight our nim dynamics fee revenues and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy with a second consecutive record net income quarter our diversified revenue strategy is clearly providing a differentiated outcome in this low rate environment outsized contributions for our wealth management team coupled with diligent expense management contributed to our success this quarter mitigating the impact of the current low rate environment turning to slide fourth quarter net interest revenue was million up more than million from last quarter the increase relates largely to net interest revenue earned on a billion increase in trading securities from our brokerage and trading customer transactions ill describe in a moment the shift to net interest revenue from fee revenue from our brokerage and trading business this quarter net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter i provided on the slide a roll forward of net interest margin and the net interest revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter highlighting more significant items ppp fees were higher in the fourth quarter as more loans were forgiven and cobz discount accretion was lower this quarter from an elevated level in the third quarter the shift in brokerage and trading customer transaction revenue from fees to net interest revenue this quarter had a dilutive impact to net interest margin that increased the dollars recorded in net interest revenue other infrequently occurring loan fees and interest recoveries are also noted in the slide to emphasize a core net interest margin of reinvestment at cash flows from our availableforsale securities portfolio continued with the portfolio yield declining basis points to additionally we continued to have success driving interestbearing deposit costs down from basis points last quarter to basis points this quarter while there are many moving parts to consider including the continued recognition of ppp interest and fees the combination of continued repricing of the afs portfolio and the limited room to move interestbearing deposit costs down further will apply pressure to net interest margin in future quarters turning to slide you can see the impact of the shift of brokerage and trading fee revenues to net interest revenue that i mentioned earlier this is largely from the record volume and timing of settlement of mortgage backed trading securities which resulted in the customer transaction revenue being earned and accounted for as interest versus fees additionally energy hedging fees while a record for the year were down million linked quarter from third quarters record level when viewed holistically our wealth management team put together another outstanding quarter with total revenue of million off slightly from the third quarter but still represents the third highest quarter on record and for the fullyear surpassed million in total revenue for the first time transaction card revenue was down this quarter primarily due to the lower transaction volumes driven by slowing consumer spending that said our transfund team had a banner year for new financial institution bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 customer contracts in which should help mitigate the decline we saw this quarter while conversion times are lengthy we expect to see a rebound in consistent with improvement in economic activity fiduciary and asset management revenue increased million this quarter primarily driven by the increase in fair value of assets under management related to both sales activity and favorable markets deposit service charges were flat for the quarter though down million for the year as we waived certain fees in the midst of the pandemic mortgage banking revenue decreased million linkedquarter due to a combination of fourth quarter seasonality and some margin compression following elevated margins due to industry capacity constraints the past few quarters that said this was still a top quarter of all time for our mortgage business which is significant given the typical seasonal declines in the last quarter of the year in total mortgage banking revenue was a record for the company increasing million from last year and acting as a significant offset to margin pressure of the protracted low rate environment although not included on slide i will note that the net economic changes and fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was positive million for the quarter though fees and commissions were down this quarter partially due to the shift in revenue geography on the income statement it is important to remember the unprecedented production levels from our fee businesses the past few quarters these businesses operating at record levels has clearly been fundamental in the success weve had this year we will continue to allocate capital and rescale the employee resources to key fee areas to maximize our revenue opportunities turning to slide expense management remains prudent with total expenses mostly flat linkedquarter while total expenses were up yearoveryear it should be noted that the increase in incentive compensation related to record annual production in our wealth management and mortgage businesses more than accounts for the total increase in expenses this year personnel expense was down linkedquarter by just over incentive compensation decreased million as a million increase in combined cashbased and deferred compensation was more than offset by a million decrease in stockbased incentive compensation from last quarters elevated level additionally there was a million decrease in employee benefit expense due to the typical seasonal decline in retirement costs and payroll taxes nonpersonnel expense was up from the third quarter we made a million charitable contribution to the bokf foundation in the quarter as we continued to focus on the communities we serve and the extreme needs created by the pandemic business promotion expense increased by just over million largely due to increased advertising expense while other expense increased million due to loss contingencies and recruiting expenses net losses and expenses on repossessed assets decreased million largely due to the writedowns on a set of oil and gas properties and retail and commercial real estate properties in the third quarter insurance expense also decreased million while mortgage banking costs dropped million on slide our liquidity position remains very strong given the continued inflow of deposit balances our loanto deposit ratio is now compared to at the end of last quarter providing significant on balance sheet liquidity to meet future customer needs we expect to see a continued inflow of customer deposits in the near term as the endofyear stimulus measures were not reflected in the december deposit figures our capital levels remain healthy as well with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating range with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 opportunistically buying back  at an average price of per share in the open market additionally we authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter to  this is the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company as we continue to reward our shareholders through varying types of economic environments on slide ill leave you with a general outlook for the near and midterm as we look into we believe loan growth will slowly accelerate in tandem with the broader economic recovery this year while mainly weighted towards third quarter and fourth quarter we think we can grow loans in the low singledigit range for the fullyear of excluding the impact of any ppp activity our availableforsale securities portfolio which is largely agency mortgagebacked securities yielded during the fourth quarter given the sustained low rate environment prepayments could reach approximately million per quarter we can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around to basis points as we noted we had success during the quarter driving deposit costs further and are well below the low point reached during the last nearzero rate environment we believe there could be room to push deposit costs a bit lower but we feel we are nearing bottom the combination of securities reinvestment at lower rates and minimal room to further lower deposit costs will pressure net interest margin in coming quarters our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue pressures being felt in our spread businesses we expect most fee revenue categories to grow modestly in with the exception of brokerage and trading and mortgage businesses as the record year in those areas will be difficult to replicate we will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and nonpersonnel costs with growth budgeted at low single digits in our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing multiyear technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position if the economy continues to improve and we get further oil price stability in additional loan loss reserve release is possible as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength we will continue looking for share buyback opportunities and well maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you steven we often share that we have intentionally built bok financial to mitigate downside risk and earnings volatility in times of economic uncertainty disciplined credit underwriting throughout the cycle and investing in growth for our feebased businesses has been a lasting point of pride for our company for many years was the ultimate test of that strategy the pressures of such a challenging year should be detrimental to the areas potential of most regional financial institutions but im very proud to say that we delivered a differentiated outcome for our customers our communities our employees and our shareholders looking ahead to we expect that strategy to continue to deliver solid results we see an opportunity to further our market share with select fee business segments along with a return of lending opportunities as our clients confidence rebounds with the economy motivating them to resume capital investment bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 while proved that earlyyear economic forecasts can change abruptly it also showcased the value of our diversified revenue model along with the experience and leadership of our management team as we worked through the challenges brought by the pandemic with that were pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to make sure i fully understood what was happening with the additional trading securities in the nii line i mean is this something that you guys initiated and is this something that is going like should we is this sort of the right level for both brokerage and for nii like im just trying to think about how this all comes together thanks steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah ken this is steven i think it was market dynamics there was a record trading in ginnie mae securities from all of the summertime activity and we facilitated those trades with our clients and those securities settled on our balance sheet more so than some of the previous securities that we traded with our clients and so we earned that transaction revenue through net interest income versus the fee revenue so it was a market dynamic shift for the most part with our trading securities up over billion on average in earning assets for the quarter so i dont know scott may know what in the future may occur but i would suspect that a lot of those trading securities will be maintained in that kind of fashion at least going into the first part of this year kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 got you okay so i guess by definition should we so if that keeps your nii elevated does that mean that we should also assume brokerage and trading revenues to stay at this much more depressed level in the first quarter and then it sounds like you said since its only going in the first quarter then maybe things go back to normal in second and third i mean is that just the right way of thinking about the dynamics steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i really think the fee revenues will stay down at this level i really think the trading activity with our clients will show up more in at least like this quarter in nii but what we do in the brokerage and trading is look at the entire revenue stream together we dont really care if the transactions are recorded as net interest income or fees and in this particular quarter its shifted more to the nii side and that may be what occurs i would suspect at least the first part of the year maybe on into we just follow kind of how it settles with our clients in how we record it in which bucket kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay i think that makes sense and then just one last question for me excluding all the trading securities right obviously your guidance for net interest margin is lower it sounds like you expect very modest loan growth maybe picking up in the backhalf of the year on average it sounds like nii ex the trading should sort of be under a fairly sizable amount of pressure i was wondering if you can kind of quantify the impact on an nii based on those factors thanks steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well ill try to give you a little bit more of a core kind of nim number to start off with in the year weve put that on the chart at about again its hard to say how much that will migrate down i do think it will because of the repricing of our availableforsale securities portfolio i mean if you look at the charts that we provide you can see a pretty natural decline in afs securities yields i think it was basis points a couple of quarters ago basis points this quarter its going to continue to roll down now weve been very successful in pushing down our interestbearing deposit cost and again this quarter in fact it was basis points average for this quarter and i think the month of december it was down about basis points can we continue pushing that downward perhaps we can but i dont think theres significant room to offset some of the afs securities repricing so i just think theres a natural kind of migration downward of net interest margin of course we focus more on net interest revenue than anything else and to your point loans beginning to grow we hope sometime in particularly in the secondhalf of the year is going to certainly help stabilize the margin and bring it back forward kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just had a followup on the inventory of trading securities so i mean were up at billion now that looking back over the last of couple years thats ranged in between billion to billion and were now at billion so it sounds like its going to stay around billion here in the nearterm but longerterm does that normalize back to that billionish level or is this just here to stay scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp hi this is scott so i would when you look at the trend throughout that built from billion end of  to billion at the end of  and then the billion a little bit over billion in the fourth quarter so we look for that to remain at a higher level that will obviously depend upon the total volume and flow inside of the mortgage markets themselves but we dont look at that reverting back as you indicated to those low levels that you were referencing brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay right thats helpful and then if you look at loan balances exppp it seems like for the last three quarters or so those kind of core loan balances have been down in between kind of to annualized i think this quarter it was down linkedquarter annualized so what gives you the confidence that you can see a reversal away from the shrinkage and towards seeing some modest loan growth here scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp well i think the biggest piece of that is you look annualized energy loans which are one of our largest segments of lending is down almost yearoveryear and linkedquarter annualized it was down so not annualized just linkedquarter so if you get stability with those energy balances which we think were close to youre going to get some paydowns i think we may see a little bit more runoff in the first quarter then hopefully we begin to plateau and grow from there we are seeing new deals there but its just not outpacing the level of deleveraging or paydowns that are happening within that book but a lot of good activity that weve gotten out of the work that we did around the ppp program we think were wellpositioned there but i think you see you need economic growth and i think you also need some of this liquidity to work its way off the balance sheet before you really get to core loan growth but i think the numbers that we gave you in terms of low singledigit loan growth for the year back weighted to the secondhalf of the year i think we feel very confident about assuming we get stability and then growth in the energy book bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thats helpful and then finally for me and a lot of people are expecting to be a fairly active year related to bank ma i know bokf has been selectively active in acquiring banks and fee income businesses over the years how do you think do you think bokf will be active in ma this year steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp well this is steve i think your assumption is accurate that were going to see more ma opportunities if you go back in time when you see low rate environment and revenue headwinds that obviously leads to a desire among some sellers to be open to conversation so thats an opportunity that we see coming as well and well continue to look at selective opportunities that maybe present themselves throughout primarily prioritizing those things that would be within the footprint brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc so obviously you guys are doing really well on the credit front and with the outlook the economy improving do you see that the reservetoloan ratio could get back to the january level which was about do you see it heading that way towards the end of this year marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp peter this is marc maun if im looking at that what im seeing is if you see continued improvement and you see the economic outlook improve you see pandemic cases drop dramatically and the vaccine results be achieved along with the energy prices continuing to be stable like weve seen in the recent months and essentially you recover back to a january outlook that was our day one adjustment amount at and that would seem likely if all those things occur of course theres still a lot of ifs in that forecast peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 okay and then steven if you get that loan growth in the secondhalf of the year would that help do you think lead to more of a stable margin closer in the secondhalf of this year steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i mean it would certainly when you remix your earning assets away from securities more into the loan balances certainly its going to help support nim going forward peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay if i could just sneak in one more question mortgage banking had a record year this year its expected to decline a little but mortgage will still be strong as we look out into the outer years have you seen that this business has youve taken market share and so therefore you should still see growth above like a level even with the mortgage banking business slowing steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah peter this is steve i think our outlook in is mortgage kind of in a steadystate fourth quarter probably a pretty good proxy although well see some probably an increase in refi activity in quarter one as we typically do and purchase market kind of kicks in a little stronger after that i do think that theres been market share gain for us because weve invested more outside of oklahoma weve got a much stronger group of producers in colorado in texas in arizona new mexico et cetera that and kansas city that have really paid off for us so thats where our expansion has been and i think its kind of a mirror in my mind to the company in that we have relatively small market share with good upside in all of those markets and i think mortgage better reflects that today than it probably did three to five years ago peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks peter operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your questions jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i guess sticking with the provision reserve level what type of qualitative overlays did you use this quarter on the energy book or in the overall book and did that really help i guess slow reserve releases and as we go through the year we should just expect that qualitative overlays reduces to get back to that lower allowance level marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah again this is marc maun yes we took a hard look at the qualitative overlays with regard to our reserves we certainly did look at more reallocation than we did reduction in certain areas energy obviously improved and we did reduce that reserve down to from the it was last quarter but we still have concerns in certain other areas where stimulus has been a key factor in a number of areas particularly in cre and in smaller businesses that may or may not have masked some issues that could occur and so we want to make sure were thoughtful about how were looking at the performance of the credit in the short term and then evaluate them on a quarterbyquarter basis depending on how economic activity evolves stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp but your general thesis is on point and i think our view is that given where we are in the cycle it was premature to do much more than what we did but certainly as we get more visibility into the economic recovery the pace of vaccinations and see declines in case counts and improvement in economic activity that could change jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thanks and then looking at the energy book do you really do you think that energy prices need to go higher from here to drive additional growth or is it really just absorbing that existing liquidity thats out there and once thats absorbed that can start driving organic growth stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp were i mean were in a decent spot here i mean if you think about oil particularly that kind of between is not a bad spot to be in in terms of kind of being stable and certainly in the permian thats an area that people continue to grow and do that profitably but from our perspective this is a price area where once we can find kind of a stable spot then i think we can grow from here there are new deals being done were doing those deals were leading many of those deals so we see good opportunity there its just at some point the pace of deleveraging from energy borrowers will slow and well really see all the hard work that our energy team is doing to grow that really come to the surface and i think were going to see that i dont know if thats first quarter or second quarter but i think that we are going to see that in jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally for me the second round of ppp has started how should we think about the potential size of that for you as well as the potential maybe average loan size compared to what we saw in the first round bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp well just by nature of it its going to be lower i mean i think the maximum loan size generally speaking is about million or caveats around revenue declines and things like that so it wont be to the size that the original ppp program was we certainly are going to be active participating working very hard to help our customers who can avail themselves of that to participate in that but we dont foresee that it will be the size of the original program as much because of the constraints around loan size as other factors jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i mean should we be thinking if you were just over billion the first time around billion or too early to say stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp its too early to say i mean were and even just yesterday theres new rules coming out that are governing the program from the sba so i think its awfully hard to prognosticate with any level of clarity at this point jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you stacy on slide you touched on loan growth maybe picking up later in the year and it sounds like a big factor in that is energy but can you touch a little bit more on if we roll this thing forward months what do you think the biggest contributors to growth might be in terms of the other loan categories stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp i think all of the loan categories i mean i think if you get if you roll this thing forward months you get stable commodity prices youre going to be growing energy midsingle digits or maybe a little bit better our healthcare book is really doing well really proud of that team you saw us back up just a hair there this quarter but that was really from some large paydowns in health systems loans which given their liquidity situation that was there really masked some really good growth that we have there in senior housing bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 and our ci businesses i think are poised to do very well i think one of the real benefits that we got from the original ppp is how strongly we executed and so weve really been able to turn that into new treasury relationships and we believe that once the market kind of looks normal again that thats going to really create some opportunities for us on the ci side because of the levels at which we executed and the ability to call a banker and have a relationship in times of need and have somebody you can call and help you out and so were optimistic that once we get to normal that growing at a pace thats kind of to times gdp if you will which is kind of how we kind of benchmark it over a long time horizon is very reasonable for us with the mix of business that we have we also have a great footprint i mean were not were in some footprint states that are going to grow faster than the rest of the united states so if you think about texas and arizona and colorado were wellpositioned from a geographic perspective to disproportionately benefit from growth as those core states economies are likely to grow faster than the national economy marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp ill add one thing to that its just from the ci perspective is that you did see reduced utilization as a big part of the decline in economic activity and we would expect if that improves then well see increased utilization on the lines of credit et cetera which will contribute to that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good you knocked up a couple of my questions there but i guess the which is good but just in general aside from energy are you seeing signs of life in the footprint i would guess it is happening particularly in some of those better markets but are you seeing the early signs of optimism in pipelines building stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp i think its i mean i think until we begin to work some of this liquidity off i dont think youre going to see huge ci loan growth were seeing some in healthcare around senior housing but really until you begin to work off some of the core liquidity thats really built up among our borrowers youre going to struggle to see that in the nearterm so i think its premature from our perspective we have not yet seen kind of a bubbling up of economic activity that would lead us to believe in the nearterm there are core ci loan growth imminent from our perspective jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one quick on credit the energy npls that you show on slide what is the path to resolution with some of those credits and particularly against the lower end of the chargeoff range that youre expecting for the fullyear marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp you know what well work through those as each one will work themself out i think that what i would tell you is a couple of things number one i think were very comfortable with the net chargeoff guidance we provided which kind of is the low end of that historical range i think if you look at what we chargedoff in i mean that would be a decent benchmark to try to beat in bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 i think the difference too is weve got a rising commodity price on those energy loans and so trying to resolve and workout energy loan in a stable and rising price environment is a totally different story than when prices continue to fall and so i think were relatively optimistic that as we work through those that the guidance that we provided you will be one that we can certainly achieve and certainly our hope is to outperform that because i think the environment is providing us a bit of an opportunity to work some of those out in a way thats to our benefit there will be losses that come from those nonperforming loans but the question is will the environment be stable and even slightly rising price environment really help mitigate those and i think were optimistic about that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah good morning and thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about operating expenses and the guidance that you guys put out there it sounds really good trying to keep that to the low singledigit growth in any more details on how you expect to achieve that and i want to make sure were applestoapples and the right starting point im looking at billion of operating expenses in is that right steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so this is steven we just worked hard i think in our budgeting efforts over the fall and mainly in november working with each line of business and trying to determine what is the right level of expense and how can we maintain control over that in the face of a little bit more difficult revenue environment and it comes all across the board it addresses personnel it addresses business promotion spending on it we want to maintain because we want to maintain our competitiveness with our products and services that we provide to our clients but its just a lot of detailed work to try to maintain that expense discipline matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the buyback im curious what the appetite is for the buyback now that the stock price is well above levels where you executed in the third quarter or fourth quarter excuse me steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i mean we were happy of our execution in the fourth quarter i mean we bought the shares at about a discount to todays market well look at it closely im not going to put a price out there that says well buy at this level and we wont buy it below that or above that so i think we look at it relative to our capital levels relative to opportunities for capital but i still think we have an appetite and we have the capital wherewithal to take advantage across the market when we see theres good opportunity bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the ppp you may have disclosed this i just missed it what was the amount that you recognized of the ppp fees in the fourth quarter and whats the remaining level of fees to recognize from here steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so we recognized in the fourth quarter million in net interest revenue from ppp and million in fees so a total of million on the fee side and we have about million roughly remaining on the fee side matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it okay thank you guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you matt operator our next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co good morning the questions largely were answered but just as it relates again to the loan growth side of things i understand obviously a stabilization in energy book would certainly be a positive for loan growth next year or this year in terms of general business and i think this was asked or answered to some degree but are you seeing any increase in pipelines there are there any pockets geographically where youre seeing activity perk up more than others scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp not particularly not at this point i think that the point that marc made earlier which i think is the best one on the ci portfolios keep in mind most of our ci portfolio is borrowingbased driven so its accounts receivable inventory and those types of things so our utilization is really pretty low in that particularly on a relative basis to where we were prepandemic so theres an opportunity for growth there organically just from higher utilization as those receivable and inventory balances begin to come back up as people grow again then thats an opportunity for growth organically but i also think as ive mentioned earlier that the work that weve done with our borrowers and with others you may have multiple banking relationships around the ppp has opened a really opportunistic pipeline for us to grow bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 broadly as well and so i think that were wellpositioned once the economy begins to turn around to grow that core ci portfolio gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and just briefly on the energy book you talked about there are new deals out there that youre participating in or leading could you give us a sense for the quarter of originations in that segment versus paydowns scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp i dont have that today certainly the paydowns far exceeded the new originations but weve done more than a handful of deals in the fourth quarter that were new deals in the marketplace and many of those we led and received fee revenue associated with that so were optimistic i think really the question is when do we get to the bottom of the deleveraging and i think were close i just dont know if thats first quarter or second quarter but i think we can see it from here gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thanks for taking my questions steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you operator there are no further questions in the queue id like to hand the call back over to mr nell for closing remarks steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp
