corp good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter financial results this quarter was another in which our diversified revenue strategy was a key differentiator for us as we grew pretax preprovision earnings by linked quarter and eclipsed million in net income for the first time in the history of our company shown on slide third quarter net income was a record million or per diluted share that represents growth in net income of from the record set last quarter a result of our longterm commitment to our balanced earnings model and breadth of business capabilities the key items that drove our success this quarter were first our feebased business units continued to perform well with total fees and commissions up million or from last quarter the contribution from our wealth management team continues to grow and impact results achieving a new quarterly record for total revenues of million for this quarter this accounts for of total revenues for the company and of total fees and commissions for the quarter mortgage fees also increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by a rebound in our reported margins from the lows recognized last quarter net interest revenue was unchanged on a linked quarter basis with a slight improvement in loan fees primarily due to nonuse fees from low utilization levels and our interestbearing deposit cost of funds fell more basis point this quarter we continue to experience some compression in yields on our available for sale portfolio however that impact was more than offset by improved yields on our trading portfolio improving market conditions and credit trends allowed us to release million of our loan loss reserve this quarter and million for the year expense management remains excellent total expense was flat on a linked quarter basis weve managed expense growth to just slightly above over the last two trailing 12month periods despite significant technology and cyberrelated investments reflecting our disciplined approach turning to slide total loans were down billion for the quarter the ppp loan forgiveness accounts for million of that contraction core loan growth continues to remain a challenge this quarter as our energy and commercial real estate customers continue to pay down debt or refinance in the longterm markets loans attributed to our wealth segment grew million this quarter allowing them to surpass billion in outstanding balances for the first time our core ci book decreased at a pace similar to last quarter as our overall line utilization levels are at fiveyear lows we believe this positions us for growth as the economy continues to rebound and supply chain disruptions are resolved average deposits increased another million this quarter and are higher than the same quarter a year ago assets under management or in custody in our wealth management business grew linked quarter to billion approaching the billion milestone largely due to new business acquisition and favorable market activity in the quarter ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the questionandanswer session but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio our credit metrics and the fee businesses in more detail ill turn the call over to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp thanks steve turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion down just over for the quarter as we continue to see borrowers in some specialty lending areas continue to reduce leverage overall commercial and specialized lending line utilization levels were down again this quarter their lowest level bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 of over the last five years with the exception to that trend being our private wealth space which grew at a annualized clip on a linked quarter basis and during the last months energy balances declined in the third quarter as energy borrowers have significant liquidity with current oil and natural gas prices and have been generally paying down debt we continue to grow new customers in this space but paydowns have outpaced new loans our current belief is that the fourth quarter will be the inflection point and we expect growth from this segment in should drilling activity materially increase the company is well positioned to have strong growth in this sector given our longterm expertise and continuing strong commitment to the energy sector ancillary business from customer hedging investment banking and treasury for this segment set a new record for fee revenue this quarter above the previous high set in the third quarter last year healthcare balances fell slightly down million or linked quarter primarily driven by our senior housing assisted living sector looking forward we remain very confident in our ability to perform from both a growth and credit standpoint in this portfolio as it remains a leader for us core middle market ci today is at the lowest level of utilization as any measured period back to march of dropping below for the first time this illustrates the significant capacity we have to move up as demand starts to come back online without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition a return to more normal utilization levels organically adds about million of core ci loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty areas while the balances declined again this quarter the broad ci portfolio is beginning to stabilize and is reason for optimism heading into next year commercial real estate balances contracted this quarter we continue to see borrowers use this low rate environment to refinance to the longterm fixed rate nonrecourse market was one of real estates lowest years for portfolio turnover as many of the permanent markets were cautious as those have opened up we see some catchup activity that is inherently a sign of a healthy portfolio but continues to create quartertoquarter volatility i would expect balances to stabilize in the fourth quarter and resume a more normal growth pattern in ppp loan balance forgiveness was substantial again this quarter with million forgiven shrinking the portfolio by of the remaining ppp balances only of the vintage and of the vintage remains we expect the forgiveness process on the remaining balances to slow considerably we believe we are well positioned for a more normal loan growth cycle as we look ahead into we believe that once supply chain constraints ease and we experience the full impact of fiscal stimulus bokf will be wellpositioned for accelerated loan growth turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to improve as we move further out from the pandemic we continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio with nonperforming assets and potential problem loans both down significantly again this quarter based on total commitments this quarter ranks the first time that weve returned to a level below the prepandemic fourth quarter of for total criticized assets from lendingrelated activities these factors coupled with continued strength in commodity prices and a continued optimistic outlook for economic growth in gdp and the labor markets led us to release million in reserves this quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points annualized excluding ppp loans in the third quarter thats a decline from last quarters million or basis points annualized net chargeoffs have dropped to an average of basis points over the past four trailing quarters which is at the lower end of our historic loss range bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 as we look forward to the next quarter we expect net chargeoffs will be at the lower end of our historical range the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at quarter end excluding ppp loans nonaccruing loans decreased million from last quarter primarily due to a reduction in nonrecurring energy loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarter end down significantly from million on june potential problem energy services and general business loans all decreased compared to the prior quarter turning to slide a highlight is the recordsetting third quarter the wealth management team produced total wealth management revenues were million for the quarter up nearly from the linked quarter and above the previous record set in the third quarter of this includes the fee income lines that investors see in our corporate income statement brokerage and trading and fiduciary and asset management as well as net interest income from loans and deposits in our private wealth group and net interest income generated as part of the brokerage and institutional trading group banking products and services for private wealth clients continue to be a particular area to highlight the total loan portfolio surpassed billion in balances this quarter and is up or million compared to the same quarter a year ago the deposit portfolio ending the quarter at billion grew linked quarter and was up compared to the same quarter a year ago total net interest income continues to grow up linked quarter total brokerage and trading revenues increased million or linked quarter this is largely due to a shift in product strategy made during the second quarter in our institutional trading and sales business coupled with adding new financial institution clients this confirms our expectation last quarter that this shift in product focus and expanded customer base is sustainable we feel confident that we will maintain a robust level of activity and revenue generation in our mbs activities firmwide our capital commitment is expected to remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future in this segment also in the wealth management space fiduciary and asset management fees were up almost linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago its important to note that the second quarter includes the annual tax preparation fees so growth on top of that is significant and related to our strong growth in assets under management which now total billion while we have seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances sales activity remains strong in this space as well our current mix of assets under management are fixed income equities cash and alternatives our relationshipdriven business model is perfectly in touch with clients needs today as we continue to see institutions and individuals retain the increased depreciation for financial advice gained throughout the past months transaction card revenue was relatively unchanged this quarter but up compared to the same quarter last year this is largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of the us economy deposit service charges were up million or this quarter as weve experienced improvements in customer spending patterns mortgage banking revenue increased million or linked quarter primarily from an improved quarterover quarter valuation of our mortgage commitments overall mortgage commitment volumes were relatively stable in the third quarter but valuations compared favorably to second quarter valuations which were largely driven by a decline in industry refinance production volumes bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 despite this change in the unrealized marktomarket between the quarters actual settlement margins are down slightly a trend weve seen all year and expect to carry forward into the fourth quarter industrywide housing inventory constraints continue to impact the market however there was some good news on the housing front as fannie and freddie both reversed their position on preferred stock purchase agreement delivery limits on second homes and investment properties which should positively benefit us in our colorado and arizona markets other revenue declined million linked quarter due to the sale of repossessed assets related to oil and gas properties although not included on slide i will also note that the net economic changes in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges were positive million during the quarter also included in our total other operating revenue but not reflected on slide is a million net gain from our activity in our alternative investment group this area focuses on providing equity and debt capital to growing businesses many of whom have been strong customers of bok financial this is a very longterm business with a portfolio that has grown to million invested in portfolio companies we expect this area to contribute to earnings going forward albeit in a somewhat episodic manner ill now turn the call over to steven to highlight our nim dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to the slide third quarter net interest revenue was million largely unchanged compared to last quarter average earning assets decreased million compared to the second quarter and average loan balances decreased billion with million of that attributable to ppp balances average core loan balances fell million average available for sale securities increased million as we continue to reinvest most of the quarterly cash flows from the portfolio average trading securities grew by million to support our brokerage and trading business and average total deposits grew million with noninterest deposits up million this quarter which supports net interest income we successfully redeemed our million sub debt during the quarter which will save approximately million annually in interest expense net interest margin was up basis points from the previous quarter with the increase primarily driven by ppp forgiveness activity thats occurred during the second and third quarters ppp loans supported net interest margin by basis points in the second quarter and basis points in the third quarter excluding all ppp impact to the margins both quarters net interest margin would be approximately the reinvestment of cash flows from our available for sale securities portfolio did result in a basis point linked quarter decline in average yields additionally we had continued success driving interestbearing deposit costs down additional basis point to basis points on average for the quarter we believe the core margin is stable and next quarter will include a full quarters benefit from the sub debt call this past quarter so with that and excluding all ppp impact we expect a net interest margin of approximately we do not expect any upward migration in net interest margin until rates begin to rise again with anticipated rate hikes potentially on the horizon within a year or so it is important to recall how well we performed during the last rate hike cycle from to in the upper or the top quartile of regional banks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 while we cant be assured to repeat that experience we dont see much that would lead us to believe the experience will be materially different in fact theres even more liquidity in the system today than before the last rate increase cycle which should diminish the need for the market to move rates up quickly turning to slide expense management remains prudent with total expenses flat linked quarter and down compared to the same quarter last year personnel expense increased million or linked quarter however this was driven by salesrelated compensation which was more than offset by the strong revenue gains overall an additional offset was due to seasonal decline in payroll taxes regular compensation expense was flat also were very happy with our ability to hold the personnel cost efficiencies earned through the pandemic and expect to do so going forward nonpersonnel expense was down million this quarter operating expenses related to repossessed properties fell million this quarter as we sold the oil and gas properties driving this expense mortgage banking costs decreased million due to a decrease in prepayments combined with lower accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others data processing and communication expense increased million as a result of various project investments on slide our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio declined from last quarter to just below at september largely due to the significant decline in ppp balances again this quarter this significant onbalance sheet liquidity leaves us wellpositioned to meet future customer needs our capital position remains very strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating range with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market on slide ill leave you with a few thoughts as we move into our budget season for we believe net activity and loan growth will improve with our company positioned for positive growth once borrower demand returns and our line utilization levels return to normal we expect the overall loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances to continue to migrate towards prepandemic levels core net interest margin has stabilized we may see slight downward pressure as our available for sale securities portfolio continues to reprice but the significant pressure on net interest margin experienced in the past year is largely behind us our diverse portfolio of fee revenue streams are expected to remain solid and will continue to provide strong support to total revenue well continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non personnel costs with total expense levels expected at similar levels seen in the past few quarters our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing multiyear technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength well continue looking for share buyback opportunities and plan to maintain our quarterly cash dividend level ill now turn the call back to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you steven as i mentioned at the top of the call it was a record quarter for bok financial we continue to do the right things the right way for the benefit of our longterm investors adding shareholder value without compromising credit discipline or foregoing investment that might hinder the companys future and as witnessed bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 by our credit outcomes the benefit from our alternative investment strategy and the new record wealth management contribution this quarter we continue to do this in a prudent diversified way while this quarter was once again about the contribution from our feebased businesses the vastly improving outlook for growth in our footprint as we emerge from the pandemic is driving customer confidence in a way we havent seen for quite some time while supply chain and workforce disruptions might be hampering some areas in the near term economic indicators remain strong which portends well for the future we are cautiously optimistic about the restart of some of our largest growth drivers in the company with that were pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey this is will jones on for brady good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp good morning william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys so i just wanted to start on loan growth i know loans were down a bit again this quarter where we were hoping for an inflection in but i hear you guys on your optimism moving into next quarter and into could you just walk us through some of the drivers that are giving you this confidence in your growth outlook and it kind of feels like a lowsingledigit growth rate may be achievable for you guys next year would you say thats a fair assessment stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah were not ready to talk about our projections at this point but ill certainly talk about why we would be optimistic about higher levels of loan growth as we move into next year if you look at the big drivers of the decline this quarter you clearly had the ppp paydowns were at about of those that we originate have paid down yeartodate energy and commercial real estate are the two other areas that really drove the biggest declines this quarter and those are the two areas that we probably have the least amount of concerns about them growing in energy bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 is very wellpositioned weve added in excess of new customers and almost billion of commitments associated with those in because of our continued commitment to that space and were very confident that as we move into next year that well see growth there same with commercial real estate you really have an anomaly because of the kind of continuous circumstances of the pandemic you had borrowers who didnt refinance so we didnt have the portfolio turnover in that we historically have so we kind of doubled up on that a little bit this year you may see a little bit of that continue into the fourth quarter but certainly our commercial real estate team has done a great job of continuing to add commitments to the book and we expect to see that as an area of growth so the two biggest areas that drove the decline this quarter in our core portfolio are the two areas that we have the most confidence in as we move into so i think that thats a big part of that and certainly our healthcare sector continues to do very well good growth there been very strong consistent growth over a long period of time core ci really is the open question it really depends on when line utilizations begin to move up theres a lot of factors involved there weve alluded to the supply chain issues that impact some of that the liquidity thats in the market is a part of that as well but were very wellpositioned good activity in our pipelines on the commercial and corporate banking side so we remain very optimistic about that william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats all super helpful and maybe just turning specifically to energy just thinking longer term about that portfolio weve seen a nice recovery in energy prices and demand eventually returns what is the ultimate expectation as to where energy loans as a percentage of your whole portfolio trends i know its historically in that to range and closer to today how do you think about your overall energy exposure longer term in relation to the total portfolio is it something you manage to a particular capital level or is it a specific loan concentration stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah we manage it both to the percent of capital and as a percent of the loan portfolio and we have significant capacity under both measures to grow that portfolio today and neither of those metrics even approaches any kind of potential headwind for growth in that sector we obviously remain very optimistic about growth there i think as you get into next year at these price levels were hopeful that therell be more drilling activity then that would certainly drive borrowing demand and obviously loan demand that goes with that so were excited about that space we think that that continues to be an area that we have great expertise and great consistency in our delivery of that into the market and weve been recognized for that with the new customers that weve acquired during the year and in fact i think in the third quarter in the league tables we were the number one originator in the energy space for the loan sizes that kind of fit our kind of less than million in total loan size so were excited about where were positioned there and we think that thats going to be a driver for us well into the future i think the other point of that is we get awfully focused on the loan balance piece of that business but i mentioned in my prepared remarks and want to reference it again that area also had a record quarter in fee revenue both in treasury revenue investment banking revenue and derivatives revenue its a big part of the nature of that bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 relationship it is not just a lending relationship its a very full and whole relationship that has other profitable aspects of the business that is important to the bank and important to our shareholders william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome all very helpful last for me just maybe more so housekeeping would you remind us what your percent utilization is today and apologies if you said that in your prepared remarks and i missed that stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah when you look at the overall portfolio its hard to give it an absolute number were in kind of about overall but thats probably not the absolute best way to look at it because some of those commitments like in energy kind of ph accordion up and down depending on prices over time i think what in our core ci kind of our corporate ci area were below for the first time in any recent history and in that particular segment we believe just a return to a more normal loan growth would enhance the loan balances by about million thats just for that more corporate ci group it doesnt impact the specialty areas and others that also would benefit from growth and increase in utilization as well william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats it for me thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens inc please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning matt stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp good morning matt olney q analyst stephens inc sticking with some of the energy questions here i think stacy you mentioned adding new customers in that business this year thats helpful what are existing energy customers saying with respect to their strong cash flows from higher commodity prices is there a talk about more drilling activity or they still expect to pay off more debt thanks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp theres modest discussion i mean the discussions really you think about as an energy producer kind of what theyve lived in the last months i mean theyve seen a day where oil price was negative and natural gas was clearly depressed to now today oil is above and natural gas at one point hit an mcf so very different environment and theyve seen a lot of volatility associated with that theyre much more disciplined around hedging and so theyre much more focused on that i think today the biggest conversation is around free cash flow and being able to have cash flow to demonstrate the returns to their investors i think is really important to them and so i think what the early discussions that we are learning about really is at this stage probably much more modest drilling activity than you might expect given the significant runup in commodity prices over the last six months or so that doesnt mean that wont change were kind of in that capital budgeting season for those energy customers so well learn more about that as ph we go throughout this quarter but certainly my expectation is for modest not significant but modest increases in drilling activity as we move into next year certainly that could change depending on a lot of factors including if commodity prices continue to increase matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats really helpful stacy and then i guess the other data point you gave us was that the energy commitment balances have grown by about billion so far this year from those newer customers im trying to appreciate the baseline of that number so do you have the overall levels of energy commitments at the bank or just an approximate number stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah at the end of september if you look at energy commitments we were at about billion and that number ebbs and flows probably more than any other committed amount because you get borrowing bases that expand and contract semiannually so the utilization there is lower than it has been historically as well its in the low50 utilization so a combination of i think were going to see commitment growth there as well as hopefully higher utilization as we go into next year matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay perfect and then just lastly for me i guess on the ppp side do you have the dollar amount of the fees that were recognized in the third quarter and how much left do you expect to recognize over the next few quarters thanks steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matt this is steven the fees we recognized in the third quarter was million thats a little bit higher than the second quarter which is million and we have million left to recognize but most of that is associated with kind of the vintage loans and so thats going to spread out we think over a longer period of time so you wont see the same level of fee recognition in the fourth quarter and on in early parts of the that youve seen so far with that vintage thats almost all gone bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hi good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc stacy can you touch on the commercial real estate balances do you expect that move to the permanent market to accelerate or is this just kind of a nagging thing thats going to be with you for a while and potentially slow at some point stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp we certainly expect it to slow i mean youve got really that we really saw that begin to accelerate in the second quarter or third quarter i think id like to see it stabilize a little bit before i call the bottom there i think its likely thats the fourth quarter but you had no movement to the permanent market last year youve got the nature of our portfolio is they tend to get to through construction and stabilization and then refinance to a nonrecourse permanent financing source so youve kind of got a couple of years that were doubling up on here but i think that will stabilize likely in the fourth quarter could stretch into the first quarter next year but my best guess is that it would be late fourth quarter this year and then wed be wellpositioned to grow from there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good and on loan growth again i know you dont want to talk about but just a couple of things youre talking about increased borrower demand line utilization returning to normal i think steve bradshaw you talked about restart of growth drivers does it feel like were just getting started on call it non stimulus driven growth in the economy if that makes sense it just feels like things are lining up for better growth plus not to mention the energy piece of this i guess are you guys bullish are you more and more bullish on growth for  and bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp were very bullish lots of reasons we stand to disproportionately benefit from commodity prices rising you got to weve got an energy book that will benefit from a growth perspective weve got a footprint that will benefit that is growing we steve and i have been in texas last couple of weeks and then you just you cannot do anything down there without saying just the enormous inmigration ive been at phoenix a lot of things going on in phoenix and denver i mean the inmigration from the coastal areas is significant our footprint is just perfect for that i think that youve seen borrower sentiment be exceptionally strong there are some economic headwinds that whether its supply chain or labor shortages that will resolve themselves at some level i think in the next quarter or two and most of the stimulus dollars have been allocated to states and local governments havent even been spent yet and so i think that there is an enormous level of growth kind of pentup and i think were in the very early stages of beginning to see that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah its interesting its like we skip the credit cycle and now were emerging to grow so it sets up pretty well just one more thing on deposit flows you used the term i think theyre abating a bit but its still very very strong what do you do you expect that to slow deposit growth to continue to slow and what do you think could eventually reverse the growth and maybe see deposits start to come down stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp we think as we kind of have had the beginnings of some of our internal discussions about how we should think about for next year we actually arent seeing from lets say the current level that you see today were not seeing material declines were not forecasting material declines in deposit levels we think that the liquidity thats in the market is going to be here because even if the current liquidity is used theres going to be additional liquidity that hasnt been pushed through the system yet that will replace that so certainly for the foreseeable months or so we believe that the deposit levels you see today are likely in the range of what you will see going forward the other question that kind of gets asked related to that well if youve got that much liquidity in the system how can you have loan growth its a fair question weve kind of looked at that back in the last time you had a significant downturn and then a recovery and you cant have loan growth with strong liquidity in the system often its in the different sectors so the total may have a lot of liquidity but different sectors are growing at different paces so it creates loan demand so those arent mutually exclusive they are related but theyre not mutually exclusive either jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help on those questions operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 thanks good morning just a couple of questions here in terms of mortgage the gain on sales you pointed out was quite a bit higher than it was last quarter and if i understood correctly is because the commitment levels kind of stabilized after a big dropoff in so i just wonder how if you could give any thoughts on how you see gain on sale migrating because youre still well above where the kind of pre2020 gain on sale levels were stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah without being specific to kind of gain on sale just looking at the business overall we think that likely what you see in the fourth quarter in the mortgage business from a revenue perspective is going to be pretty close to in line with what you saw in the second quarter from a mortgage revenue perspective well there may be some opportunities on the expense side related to msr amortization that may benefit us a little bit more in the fourth quarter so our overall contribution for mortgage we would expect to be kind of consistent with the second quarter and maybe a little bit better when you look at pretax contribution for mortgage but the revenue levels we think will be much more consistent with what we saw in the second quarter gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you and then steven i know you mentioned that you expect ppp forgiveness to kind of be stretched out from here but could you just remind us what the remaining ppp fees are to be recognized steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yes million thats what we have remaining and i think the balance of the ppp loans is million something like that and again its that kind of second round or vintage which will be forgiven over a longer period of time than you saw in the first round so thats why we think the million will be spread out over many upcoming quarters gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co yeah all right great thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from line of matt olney with stephens inc please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah hey guys just a few more here on the followup side im looking at the average balance sheet and it looks like the investment securities balances are now around of average earning assets which i think is the highest level we can find going back several years at the bank is there any appetite to move that higher in the near term as we wait for loan growth or do you think this has now peaked at this point steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i think its just generally peaked i mean weve theres two components for that i think billion roughly is afs and the other billion or so we have for our trading portfolio but the billion afs i think is pretty close to where we want it to be it is up a couple of hundred million this quarter but we dont really have any bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 initiatives to drive that higher not in the face of what we think will ultimately be some increasing rate hopefully by the end of so were pretty comfortable with our interest rate risk position and that afs portfolio is i think at the right level at least the way were thinking about it today stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp matt you thinking about being positioned for rising rates i think if you look at our performance through the last rising rate cycle we were kind of a topquartile bank from that perspective and certainly the language coming out of the fed the various governors over the last month or so has certainly been more indicative of tightening than continued loose monetary policy so we currently are forecasting our first increase in december next year i think theres probably more pressure that happens sooner than later than that and were awfully wellpositioned to benefit from rising rates and would want to be wellpositioned for that if it comes sooner than later matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thats a great point stacy thanks for bringing that up and i guess what about on the loan floor side whats the level of loan floors you have at this point and then how many rate increases do you have to see to get above some of those floors steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well theres just shy of billion of our loans have floors embedded in them right now its supporting net interest income about million a year and so it supports nim about basis points so that kind of give you an idea of what you would have to push through and the support that were getting there now stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp and those are rolloff were competitively were able to get fewer floors in deals today than we were months ago so if you assume kind of a three year rolloff of that then theyll be less in months than they are today for sure matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah and going back to the afs securities portfolio it sounds like there could be a little bit more pressure on the yields there but were getting close to bottoming is that fair steven steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i mean if you look at the portfolio yield itself is i looked this morning we added some securities in fact yesterday at so those are four to fiveyear duration securities so we do have a little bit of there is room there for that to continue to reprice down thats why i mentioned it but i dont think its an overall huge drag on net interest margin i really think that weve overall stabilized the margin pretty well but there is a little bit less there if rates stay low and between the portfolio yield and what were adding in terms of the cash flow that we get back and reinvest bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp we did pay off steven alluded to this we did pay off the sub debt in the third quarter and that was a partial impact of that so we still have a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter of around million that should be beneficial overall to the margin as well steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the loan yield side i think were trying to separate the ppp impact and look at just the core yield and i think you mentioned the two loan categories ph where you have strong conviction that could grow next year would be energy and then commercial real estate did i get that right is it fair to say that those two categories have higher yields on average than most other parts of the portfolio at the bank stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp thats true statement matt olney q analyst stephens inc and stacy how would you characterize energy loan spreads today historically and then versus the rest of the portfolio are they still relatively higher stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp they are as folks have decided to leave the space clearly the spreads there have been very stable there are fewer competitors there today and were still getting the appropriate spreads for the risk that we take in that space matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay perfect all right last one guys brokerage and trading you guys hit a home run this quarter looks like it was mostly on trading and then customer hedging i know its tough to predict kind of quarter to quarter but could you talk more about the sustainability of these levels in the third quarter stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer director bok financial corp yeah let me hit a couple of things here and then ask scot if he wants to add anything to that were really proud of our wealth group were just right at billion in assets under management and sometimes whether its energy on the lending side or the trading businesses on the wealth side those types of things kind of overshadow what the core is happening inside the company and looking certainly the trading businesses create volatility but if you look at wealth revenues overall there is intraquarter volatility but weve grown wealth total revenue year overyear for over consecutive years now and that wealth revenue cagr is in excess of and so theres bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 volatility in some of these trading businesses but theres core growth thats happening and i think the markets missing inside of our wealth business and so as we think about the fourth quarter we think the trading aspect of that business will be probably somewhere between what we saw in the second quarter and in the third quarter probably not as strong as the third quarter probably maybe a little bit better than what we saw in the second quarter but if you think about the business and how we think about that business total wealth revenue has been a significant driver of our company and its not just the trading business its the assets under management that were providing counsel for our customers and institutions around you typically will see assets that are managed theyre half the size of the core bank ours are over twice the size of the core bank and almost billion so were proud of that business and were excited about what weve done on the trading side but the core wealth business has been a key growth driver for our company for a long time scott anything you want to add to that scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp no i think stacy said it well i think that in addition to the probably more volatile quartertoquarter result on the institutional trading side we have kind of quietly managed to grow our retail brokerage revenues as well at a healthy rate both on a linked quarter basis and versus last year and also in our investment banking business has been very strong as stacy said earlier in prepared comments but were really you couple that with the continued momentum that were getting both on the mortgagebacked securities side that is that large component but coupled with investment banking retail brokerage and then on our hedging activities not just energy related but also in our fx business and our interest rate derivative activity all those components are we think very well positioned for continued momentum matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay great stuff guys thanks again scott bradley
