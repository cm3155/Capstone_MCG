nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and is conveyed to outside parties capital adequacy and prompt corrective action the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic have issued substantially similar riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to united states banking organizations to ensure capital adequacy based upon the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels whether because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components risk weighting and other factors federal reserve board riskbased guidelines define four capital metrics based on three categories of regulatory capital common equity tier capital cet1 includes common shareholders equity less goodwill most intangible assets and other adjustments tier capital consists of cet1 capital plus certain additional capital instruments and related surplus supplementary capital tier consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities limited amounts of subordinated debt other qualifying term debt and allowances for credit losses subject to limitations assets and offbalance sheet exposures are assigned to categories of riskweights based primarily upon relative credit risk riskbased capital ratios are calculated by dividing cet1 tier and total capital by riskweighted assets in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the company is also subject to the leverage ratio the leverage ratio is determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets additional capital rules were effective for banks and bank holding companies including bok financial on january as part of a package of regulatory reforms developed by the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking

meet minimum capital requirements would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the fdicia among other things identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions failing to meet minimum capital requirements within such categories fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive covenants on operations management and capital distributions depending upon the category in which an institution is classified the various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by fdicia using the total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized stress testing the regulatory relief act eliminated the requirement for periodic company run capital stress tests known as the doddfrank act stress test for banks with assets less than billion although the mandate has been lifted the company still continues to perform capital stress testing on a regular basis executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder the federal reserve board has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking this guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either
