Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gave about half a billion dollars in special stock bonuses to its roughly 400
partners, people familiar with the matter said.                         

Goldman executives chose to give partners a special bonus -- rather than simply boost their standard stock
awards -- to gift-wrap it as a one-time event and keep their expectations in check going forward, the people
said.                                                                   
"To the extent the environment in 2022 shifts, that compensation model is highly variable," Goldman's chief
financial officer told analysts Tuesday, signaling to shareholders that the company's generosity was a one-off.

The shares given to partners at Goldman, which produced a record $59 billion in revenue in 2021, vest more
quickly than the company's basic stock awards, people familiar with the matter said. That makes the shares
more valuable and more competitive with the equity doled out by technology firms and some boutique
banks, which is available quickly and with few restrictions on selling. 

Michael Bucella, who left his Goldman job in 2017 for BlockTower Capital, a crypto investment firm, said
former colleagues are reaching out in large numbers. "'It's like, 'I'm in Miami, let's get dinner, and by the way
here are three job offers I'm considering,'" he said. Crypto "offers compensation and a level of excitement that
the banks just can't."
