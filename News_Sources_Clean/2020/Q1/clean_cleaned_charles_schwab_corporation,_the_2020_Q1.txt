EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Not the Best Time For No Commissions --- Free trading is making small
investors trade more often. In a scary market, that could be bad news.

The age of free stock trading has arrived at an inauspicious time -- exactly when many individual investors
might have been best served to not trade at all.                        
It was just in October that Charles Schwab , E*Trade Financial , Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade
Holding announced that they would charge zero commissions for most trades. The moves put them in line
with some newer online upstarts, notably Robinhood Financial, and were followed by more expansions of free
trading at big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America .       
In case there was any mystery about whether making trading free would increase some people's
consumption of it, the results were immediate: Volumes surged to record levels late last year at some online
brokers. At Ameritrade , February daily-average trading volumes were more than double what they were a
year prior. Schwab on Friday said that clients hit a high of 2.7 million trades on March 9, twice the average
daily level in February, which was itself up 53% year-over-year.        

EXCHANGE --- Weekend Investor -- The Intelligent Investor: The E*Trade Deal Reveals the New Rules
of the Investing Game --- Brokerages don't want to be your 'financial supermarket.' They want to grab
your cash.                                                              

Some outfits -- especially Charles Schwab Corp . and Fidelity Investments -- made one-stop-shopping work,
managing money themselves while offering funds from other firms as well.

Morgan Stanley , E*Trade and Schwab all own banks to which they route much of their customers' cash.
E*Trade pays its customers 0.01% to 0.25% on their uninvested cash; Morgan Stanley , 0.03% to 0.2%;
Schwab, 0.06% to 0.3%.                                                  
Brokerages have been pocketing 2% and up on that money (and you can do almost as well, if you pull the
cash from your brokerage account and park it in a certificate of deposit or savings account at the right online
bank).                                                                  
Schwab, which has hoovered up $220 billion in bank deposits, earned 61% of its total net revenues in 2019
from the interest it captured on those balances.
