Morgan Stanley said it is buying fund manager Eaton Vance for $7 billion, continuing the Wall Street firm's
shift toward safer businesses like money management.

But Palantir's debut was mired by technical issues with Morgan Stanley software that prevented some
existing investors in the company from unloading shares for much of the afternoon, according to people
familiar with the matter, throwing into question whether there are more sellers waiting in the wings.
Palantir employees use Morgan Stanley's stock-plan business, called
Shareworks, which suffered from technical difficulties Wednesday. The Shareworks platform is used by many
companies, not just those going public via direct listings.             
"We experienced slowness that may have resulted in delayed logins into our system. At all times, our call
centers were available to execute trades. We will work through any issue that is brought to our attention and
ensure that no employee will be disadvantaged," a Shareworks by Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. The
implication is that employees who had to sell at a lower price will be "made whole," according to a person
close to the bank.                                                      
Both Asana and Palantir enlisted Citadel Securities as designated market
maker and Morgan Stanley as lead financial adviser for their debuts.
