Banks Aid Financing for Black-Owned Firms ........................................................................................................... 2
Big Banks See No Profit From Pandemic Loan Fees .............................................................................................. 5

The biggest banks in the U.S. will give Black-owned businesses advantageous terms on a crucial type of
financing that companies use to manage their cash flow, a novel effort to narrow the wealth gap between
white and nonwhite communities.                                         
Banks made multibillion-dollar commitments to expand lending to Black consumers and businesses after the
wave of protests throughout the U.S sparked by the killing of George Floyd. The targeted lending is meant to
correct decades of discrimination in lending whereby banks denied loans to Black borrowers or steered them
toward products with high interest rates and other terms many couldn't afford.

Bank of America Corp. say they will
lower charges to Black- and other minority-owned companies in supply-chain finance programs. Companies
use supply-chain finance to manage short-term spending needs, similar to the way a consumer might use a
credit card.                                                            

Bank of America will use some of the proceeds from a $2 billion environmental, social and governance bond
it issued in September to fund financing to minority-owned suppliers in the U.S. Black and Hispanic suppliers
will get a discount on the rate the bank charges for supply-chain finance, said Geoff Brady, head of global
trade and supply-chain finance.                                         
The bank will target hundreds of suppliers in the next several months, he said. One goal of the program is for
Bank of America to get access to new, diverse clients with the hopes of banking them beyond supply-chain
finance.                                                                

Big Banks See No Profit From Pandemic Loan Fees                         

At JPMorgan Chase, the chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak, said on a quarterly earnings call in July that
profit from the program ''will be near zero.'' Her counterpart at Bank of America, Paul M. Donofrio, said he did
not expect much profit, ''if any.''                                     

Analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank, believe the median fee paid to banks was around 3
percent. At that rate, Bank of America, which gave nearly $26 billion to
340,000 businesses, would have received $767 million.                   
Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citibank and Wells Fargo, the nation's four biggest banks, all pledged not to
profit from the program. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, told NPR, ''We just have to cover
our costs, and then we'll give the money to programs that we have to support small business and
communities throughout the country.''                                   
But the program's expenses were also high, the big banks said. Bank of America devoted 10,000 employees
to making loans at the program's peak, Mr. Moynihan said in July, and expects the next stage of the program
-- helping companies through the paperwork to have their loans forgiven, if they qualify -- to be complicated
and time consuming.                                                     
The fees his bank collected are ''not insignificant,'' Mr. Moynihan acknowledged, but ''there's a lot of cost
against it.''                                                           

Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment on what charitable donations, if any, they plan to make
with their proceeds. (Each has made other large corporate donations in response to the pandemic.)
