Millions of Americans are out of work. But for many, tapping their home equity isn't an option.
New home-equity lines of credit dropped 19% from March through May compared with the same time last
year, according to preliminary data from credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc.
Many lenders are getting stricter about offering the credit lines, known as Helocs. Both JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. have temporarily stopped accepting new Heloc applications, and other lenders
have tightened standards.                                               
Banks are trying to protect themselves from the big losses they suffered in the 2008 crisis, when borrowers
who had been using their homes as ATMs defaulted as housing prices unexpectedly tanked. But the lenders'
caution means that in many cases borrowers who thought they would be able to fall back on their home
equity in a crisis can't do so now.                                     
U.S. banks' holdings of home-equity lines of credit were down more than 9% from a year earlier as of early
June, the largest decline on record, according to Federal Reserve data. Originations of home-equity loans,
another popular way for borrowers to pull cash out of their homes, fell 43% from March through May,
according to Equifax.                                                   
But in April, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo said they would temporarily stop accepting new Heloc applications.
JPMorgan cited high unemployment rates and projections that housing prices would fall.
