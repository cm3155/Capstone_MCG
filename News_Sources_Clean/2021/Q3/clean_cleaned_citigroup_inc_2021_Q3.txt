Titans like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are taking a hard-line approach, beefing
up in-person staff five days a week in New York even though it might mean losing talent. Rivals including
Citigroup Inc. are touting flexibility, betting that a softer approach will help them poach top traders and deal
makers.                                                                 

Other banks are betting the strict attitude will look outdated and help them draw in new talent. A recent study
by consulting giant McKinsey & Co. showed that more than half of employees prefer hybrid work -- a mixture
of working remotely and heading into the office -- up from 30% before the pandemic. "The playing field was
level for all these banks because they were forced to work from home at the same time," said Chris Wooten,
an executive vice president at the consulting firm NICE who is working with banks to ensure remote-work
plans meet risk and compliance guidelines. "The great experiment starts . . . when some go back to the office
full time and some don't."                                              
Citigroup said in March that the bulk of its workforce would be in the office about three days a week. "Our
vision is you can't go back to what it was, you have to go forward," said Tyler Dickson, the global co-head of
banking, capital markets and advisory.                                  

Citigroup has been hiring thousands of coders and computer programmers.
