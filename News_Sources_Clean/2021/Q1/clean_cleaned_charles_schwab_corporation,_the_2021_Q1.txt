Last year, brokerages such as Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade, Robinhood Markets Inc. and E*Trade
collected nearly $2.6 billion in payments for stock and option orders, according to JMP Securities. The
biggest sources of the payments were electronic-trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna
International Group LLP and Virtu Financial Inc.                        

SEC rules were updated in 2019 to require stockbrokers to act in the best interests of investors when
providing investment advice. But Robinhood, Charles Schwab Corp. and other online trading platforms avoid
such rules when they enable investors to buy and sell shares on their own, without the intermediation of a
broker.                                                                 

One of Mr. Gensler's recent MIT lectures looked at Robinhood, Charles Schwab and other firms that offer free
trading, a trend he traced to the abolition of fixed commission rates in the 1970s, according to a video of the
class available online. Mr. Gensler didn't criticize Robinhood in his lecture but explained how its growth
influenced other brokers to copy its pricing model.
