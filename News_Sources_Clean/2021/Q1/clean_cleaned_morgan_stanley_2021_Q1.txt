Before Greensill Failed, It Relied on Wall Street
LONDON -- The founder of Greensill Capital spoke frequently about disrupting big banks. But before the
financial startup collapsed this month, it relied on the apparatus of Wall Street to fuel its expansion.
Greensill's closest Wall Street relationship was with Credit Suisse Group AG, which provided it financing
through $10 billion of investment funds. But a clutch of other big players -- including Citigroup Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Ernst & Young, and Moody's Investors Service -- played key roles in Greensill's rise.

Greensill also leaned on Morgan Stanley, which for several years acted as an intermediary between Greensill
and the investors in the notes. These included funds at Credit Suisse and Swiss asset manager GAM Holding
AG, according to people familiar with the funds and the Greensill marketing document reviewed by the
Journal.
Morgan Stanley provided the funds with information about the notes, including pricing and duration of the
underlying loans, and placed the notes with the funds for a fee, the people said.

Morgan Stanley also helped Greensill's biggest client in 2019, when GAM shut a fund that had been an
important source of financing for Greensill. Some of the assets in the GAM fund were tied to businesses
owned by U.K. steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta.
Morgan Stanley used a special-purpose vehicle to repackage about GBP 220 million, equivalent to $300
million, of Greensill-arranged bonds related to Mr. Gupta's businesses held in the GAM funds. Morgan
Stanley then sold them to its clients, according to some of the people familiar with the funds.
