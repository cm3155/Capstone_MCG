Rob Reilly, the McCann Worldgroup creative chief who worked on the "Fearless Girl" campaign for State
Street Corp., is leaving the Interpublic Group of Cos. agency to join rival advertising behemoth WPP PLC.
Mr. Reilly's appointment to the newly created post of global chief creative officer signals WPP's commitment
to creative functions, according to the company, after recent changes that have favored its digital marketing
operations.                                                             
Mr. Reilly, who will start at WPP in May, is known for his creative ideas and work on buzz-generating
campaigns, including the installation of a bronze statue of a girl facing down the iconic "Charging Bull" statue
in lower Manhattan on behalf of State Street Global Advisors.           
The "Fearless Girl" became a symbol of female empowerment and stirred discussion of gender diversity in
business.
