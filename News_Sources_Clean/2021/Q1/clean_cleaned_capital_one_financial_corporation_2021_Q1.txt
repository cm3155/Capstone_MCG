The Treasury Department said it fined Capital One Financial Corp. for "willfully failing to implement and maintain" effective anti-money-laundering controls.                     
As part of the settlement, Capital One admitted that it "willfully failed to file thousands of suspicious-activity reports," according to the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The allegations pertain to a check-cashing group that Capital One acquired when it bought North Fork Bank in 2006.
FinCEN said it had assessed a $390 million penalty but that it agreed to give Capital One credit for a $100 million penalty it paid to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2018. Capital One acknowledged its actions violated the Bank Secrecy Act. The allegations cover practices between at least 2008 and 2014, the same year Capital One exited the check-cashing business.                
FinCEN said Capital One's actions caused "millions of dollars in suspicious transactions to go unreported in a timely and accurate manner, including proceeds connected to organized crime, tax evasion, fraud, and other financial crimes laundered through the bank into the U.S. financial system." FinCEN said the bank acknowledged failing to file suspicious-activity reports even when it had knowledge of criminal charges against customers, including a convicted associate of the Genovese organized-crime family.
A Capital One spokeswoman said the bank takes its anti-money-laundering obligations seriously. The bank "has invested heavily in the enhancement of its AML program over the past several years under new AML leadership, and has worked closely with regulators and law enforcement to ensure our compliance processes and protocols are robust and thorough."
