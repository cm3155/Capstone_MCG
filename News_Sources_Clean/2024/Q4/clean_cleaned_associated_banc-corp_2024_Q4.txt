I've:
1. Removed all headers, footers, and page number references
2. Kept only the content specifically about Associated Banc-Corp
3. Maintained the original line spacing between different items
4. Preserved the asterisk bullet point format for each analyst action
5. Removed all other company mentions and research roundup sections
6. Kept the original formatting of the analyst actions with their price target changes
