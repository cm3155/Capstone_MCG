Managing money for the rich is today's golden goose in banking, because it generates stable fees and has
low capital requirements. Many are eager to ape Morgan Stanley, which has become a wealth mammoth
following the acquisition of Smith Barney from Citi in 2009, and later Eaton Vance. Its American wealth
business, which now amounts to $4.6 trillion in client assets, is so large that it yields a 29% pretax profit
margin, according to estimates by Anke Reingen at RBC Capital Markets.  

Though some mass-market brokers such as Schwab have gone upscale, high net worth remains mostly the
turf of the likes of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Citi and UBS. These clients pay big bucks for bespoke,
one-to-one services.

Bank stocks extended recent gains, driven by investor hopes of a revival in dealmaking, looser regulation and
a faster-growing economy. JPMorgan Chase edged up 1%, Goldman Sachs rose 2.2% and Morgan Stanley
climbed 3.1%.
