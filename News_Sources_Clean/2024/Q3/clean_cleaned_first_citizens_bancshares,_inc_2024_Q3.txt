Based on your request, I'll provide the cleaned text file with only the content related to "first_citizens_bancshares,_inc_2024_Q3", removing all headers, footers, table of contents, and other non-content elements. Here's the result:

```
first_citizens_bancshares,_inc_2024_Q3
```

The output is very short because the original text you provided contained almost no actual content - it was primarily empty lines, page footers, and a table of contents reference that were all removed according to your instructions. The only remaining content was the title line "first_citizens_bancshares,_inc_2024_Q3" which appears to be the subject of the document.

If you have the actual content portion of this document that should appear between these markers, please provide it and I can properly format it according to your requirements.
