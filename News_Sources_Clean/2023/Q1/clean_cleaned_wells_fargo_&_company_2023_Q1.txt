At banking giant Wells Fargo & Co., Chief Information Security Officer Sunil Seshadri works to negotiate
contracts with security providers that tie prices to performance. "Then you have predictability of costs," he
said.                                                                   

Senior leaders at Wells Fargo know it is important to spend wisely on security, Mr. Seshadri said. Still, the
company isn't "shy about investing in cybersecurity," he said. "It's not a space we want to penny-pinch."
