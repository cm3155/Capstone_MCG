Silicon Valley Bank, which was recently acquired by First Citizens BancShares, has resumed lending to the
startup and venture market, though less aggressively than in the past.  
SVB's slowdown in lending is contributing to a sharply decelerating venture-debt market, which means there
are fewer sources of financing at the very time more startups are struggling.
"The economy and the fundraising environment are headwinds on loan origination," said Marc Cadieux, a
30-year-veteran of SVB who was named president of its commercial banking division in June. "Fewer
companies are able to clear that key underwriting bar -- do you still have the support of venture investors
behind you," he said.                                                   
The SVB loan book is expected to decline by about 8% by year-end, assuming the venture market remains
depressed, said Craig Lockwood Nix, chief financial officer of First Citizens, during its first-quarter earnings
call in May. First Citizens acquired SVB in March after the bank failed and was taken over by federal
regulators.                                                             
As of March 31, SVB had a loan book of $66 billion, with about a quarter of that issued to technology and
healthcare companies and 55% to venture and private-equity funds. By April 30, it had declined 9% to $62
billion, according to First Citizens' first-quarter earnings presentation.
Nix said most of the contraction would likely come in the borrowing by venture and private-equity funds, while
loans to tech and healthcare companies would remain steady. That contrasts with several years of loan
expansion at the legacy SVB business.                                   
SVB continues to originate loans in all of its lending segments, Cadieux said. "The priority is to be there for
our clients in whatever way they need us," he said. SVB is aware of how critical venture debt is to the startup
and venture community, and the bank continues to extend credit in cases where a company is close to being
able to turn a profit, he said.
