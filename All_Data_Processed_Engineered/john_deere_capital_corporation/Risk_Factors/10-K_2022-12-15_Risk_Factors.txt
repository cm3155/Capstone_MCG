item risk factors the results of operations of the company are affected by its relationships with john deere see relationships of the company with john deere for additional information regarding the relationship between the company and john deere the following risks are considered material to the companys business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations including the risks and uncertainties described in the forwardlooking statements the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors of deere company included in exhibit to this annual report on form 10k and incorporated herein by reference these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods and involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular portions of the business while others could affect all the companys business although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the forwardlooking statements in this report are not the only risks faced by the company strategic risks the profitability and financial condition of the companys operations are dependent upon the operations of john deere the companys volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products the results of operations of the company are affected by its relationships with john deere including among other items the terms on which the company acquires receivables and borrows funds from john deere the reimbursement for interest waiver and lowrate finance programs from john deere the compensation paid by john deere in connection with the companys purchase of trade receivables from john deere and the payment to john deere for various expenses applicable to the companys operations in addition john deere and the company have joint access to certain lines of credit if there were significant changes in the production or sales of john deere products the quality or resale value of john deere equipment john deeres liquidity capital position debt ratings and access to capital markets the reputation of john deere or inflationary pressures supply chain constraints or other factors impacting john deere or its products such changes could significantly affect the companys profitability financial condition and access to capital markets in addition if there were changes to sales incentive programs offered by john deere to retail customers in which the company receives reimbursement for interest waiver and lowrate finance programs this could decrease the companys market share of john deere financed equipment volumes and profitability international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deeres profitability and growth prospects as the companys volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products these macroeconomic drivers could also negatively impact the companys profitability and growth prospects international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deeres products services and technology or those of its customers including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deeres global business john deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and highquality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements nontariff trade barriers local content requirements and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations and sanctions against russia have limited and could continue to limit john deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deeres ability to expand the business these trade restrictions and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies may affect john deeres competitive position policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deeres and the companys competition customer base and product offerings and impact john deeres and the companys growth opportunities globally john deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and south africa and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deeres other markets having business operations in various regions and countries exposes john deere and the company to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate including those related to tariffs and trade regulations investments property ownership rights taxation repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the companys financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less known in some emerging markets which could impede john deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets the conflict between russia and ukraine could adversely impact john deeres business and financial results on february john deere suspended shipments of machines and service parts to russia and belarus as a result the company has not offered any new financings in russia after assessing the impact of the russia and ukraine conflict on john deeres operations within russia john deeres senior management in the us decided to initiate a voluntary employeeseparation program which reduced overall headcount in russia john deere may further reduce or discontinue operations in russia depending on the continued evolution of the conflict monetary currency or payment controls restrictions on access to financial institutions supply and transportation challenges sanctions and export controls and countersanctions or other circumstances and considerations john deeres us senior management continues to closely monitor all risks to john deeres and the companys operations in the region the broader consequences of the russia and ukraine conflict such as embargoes regional instability geopolitical shift access to natural gas higher energy prices potential retaliatory action by the russian government including nationalization of foreign businesses increased tensions between the us and countries in which john deere and the company operate and the extent of the conflicts effect on the global economy cannot be predicted including the extent to which the conflict may heighten other risks disclosed herein ultimately these or other factors could result in further loss or writedowns of other operating assets and working capital for john deere for further description of the companys outstanding exposure related to russia refer to note to the consolidated financial statements negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deeres equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs for john deere and the company the demand for john deeres and the companys products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment rising interest rates cautious consumer spending changes in consumer practices due to a possible recession lower corporate earnings and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause john deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deeres equipment the covid19 pandemic covid geopolitical instability including the conflict between russia and ukraine and other global events have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty some of the results of these events include supply chain challenges inflation high interest rates foreign currency exchange volatility and volatility in global capital markets these adverse economic events have and may continue to adversely affect john deeres and the companys operations sustained negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts energy prices and demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions in fiscal supply constraints shortage of turf inventory and softening customer demand have affected john deeres production and sales of consumer products within these segments decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deeres and the companys results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deeres agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook such as market volatility and continued interest rate increases by the federal reserve have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows additionally john deeres and the companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets including the recent volatility of the united kingdoms bond market which would negatively affect earnings changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies including those related to climate change and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses while higher commodity prices benefit john deeres cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing bioenergy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deeres dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs for john deere related to equipment fuel standards these changes could have a negative effect on the companys results john deere and the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions john deeres failure to realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and related business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition several factors could impact john deeres ability to successfully execute the smart industrial operating model including among other things failure to accurately assess market opportunity and the technology required to address such opportunity failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by john deeres customers and failure to holistically execute lifecycle solutions in addition if john deere is unable to optimize its capital allocation in connection with the operating model including capital allocation for the development and delivery of financial solutions provided by the company it may not be able to realize the full benefits of john deeres smart industrial operating model which could have an adverse effect on john deeres and the companys financial condition or results of operations similarly john deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its leap ambitions and related goals in the expected timeline or at all as part of its leap ambitions framework john deere adopted various goals that it expects to achieve by or as applicable john deere may not be able to achieve these goals for a number of reasons some of which may be out of its control for example john deeres estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of its products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate certain materials such as quality battery cells may become unavailable or too costly or infrastructure required to achieve its goals such as sufficient charging stations may become too costly or may not occur on the expected timeline the actual or perceived failure of john deere to achieve its leap ambitions could negatively impact its ability to execute the smart industrial operating model and could harm john deeres and the companys reputation and business john deeres ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results john deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success in addition the companys ability to anticipate and deliver on customers changing preferences for financial solutions is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deeres and the companys existing and potential customers on a global basis failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deeres and the companys business customer preferences in the markets served by john deere could change as these markets transition to less carbonintensive business models ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability and the impact of policies and consumer preferences on the construction forestry and agriculture industries mean that change is imminent as regulations and social pressure drive change john deere must be proactive in monitoring trends and developing alternatives and enhancements that complement its product offerings for example john deere may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture turf and construction equipment the development of alternative farming techniques carbon sequestration technologies and new lowcarbon biofuels could change farmers business models and equipment needs if john deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands john deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue which could affect john deeres and the companys future financial results john deeres and the companys ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business results of operations and financial condition john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products in addition john deeres industry is attracting nontraditional competitors including technologyfocused companies and startup ventures john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deeres business results of operations and financial condition which could have a negative effect on the companys results the equipment finance industry in which the company competes is highly competitive we compete for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon service finance rates charged and other finance terms in addition the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants the companys ability to maintain and expand our market share is contingent upon us offering competitive pricing developing and maintaining strong relationships with dealers and customers making substantial investments in our technological infrastructure and effectively responding to changes in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment markets in addition any expansion into new markets may require us to compete with more experienced and established market participants failure to effectively manage these challenges could adversely affect our market share and pressure to provide competitive pricing could have a negative effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition john deere relies on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of its products if dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations it could have an adverse effect on overall john deere sales and revenue john deere relies on the capability of john deere dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that the dealers purchase from john deere if john deeres dealers are not successful in these endeavors then john deere will be unable to grow its sales and revenue which would have an adverse effect on john deeres and the companys financial condition in addition the dealer channels ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers acceptance and adoption rates of these products dealers may have trouble funding their daytoday cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors dealers may exit or john deere may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs the unplanned loss of any john deere dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage negative customer impressions of john deere and may adversely impact john deeres and the companys ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer environmental climate and weather risks unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deeres and the companys business poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deeres customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperature affects the rate of growth maturity and quality of crops temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise have had and could in the future have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers and john deeres dealers adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region particularly during the important spring selling season may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lowercarbon economy could adversely affect john deere and its customers there is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas ghg emissions continue to alter the composition of earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations have led to new international national regional and local legislative and regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere and the company are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to john deere and the company in the form of taxes or emission allowances required facilities improvements and increased energy costs which would increase john deeres and the companys operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also affect customer operations and demand for john deere equipment additional international and national european regulations relating to climate and environmental risk which are continually evolving could affect the lending operations and climaterisk processes developed by the company regulators in europe and the us have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts the securities and exchange commission sec has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that if adopted could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity financial risks changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on the company policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on the companys customers and markets the companys operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could among other things have an adverse effect on the company and its customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development the companys and john deeres operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere and the company john deere and the company are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions john deeres and the companys domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deeres and the companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretations if john deeres and the companys effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued john deeres and the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected the companys consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk the company operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies the company is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which it earns revenues additionally the reporting currency for the companys consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the companys assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies which are then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates in the companys reported consolidated financial statements therefore fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide the company with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates because the company is subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of the companys customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to the company in response to increasing inflation the us federal reserve began to raise interest rates in march for the first time in over three years and has signaled it expects to make additional rate increases rising interest rates could cause credit market dislocations which could have an impact on funding costs which are important to the company because such costs affect the companys ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the companys net interest income and earnings in addition actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position further due to the cessation of the london interbank offered rate libor the company has entered into financial transactions such as credit agreements receivables derivatives and notes that use the secured overnight financing rate sofr or the sterling overnight index average sonia as interest rate benchmarks sofr and sonia are calculated differently from libor and have inherent differences which could give rise to uncertainties including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates the full effects of the transition to sofr sonia or other rates remain uncertain because the company is a financing company negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact the companys operations and financial results negative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the company operates the company provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales in many of the countries in which the company operates the company is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the companys inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the companys liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the companys writeoffs and provision for credit losses the companys results could be adversely affected by a decrease in the value of used equipment or higher than estimated returns of equipment on operating lease the company sells repossessed equipment and equipment returned to us at the end of lease terms primarily through the john deere dealer network the company estimates the endoflease term residual value at the inception of the operating leases based on a number of factors including lease term expected hours of usage historical wholesale sale prices return experience intended use of the equipment market dynamics and trends and thirdparty residual guarantees used equipment values may decrease as a result of any one or a combination of factors including market conditions supply of and demand for used equipment and technological advancements in new equipment depressed prices for used equipment may result in or increase a loss upon our disposition of offlease or repossessed equipment and in the case of repossessed equipment we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency in addition lower residual value estimates could result in increasing operating lease depreciation impairment losses and losses on the sale of matured operating lease inventory which would decrease the companys earnings manufacturing and operational risks changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in significant disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products as the companys volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products supply chain disruptions and impacts of price increases could negatively impact the companys future volumes john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products the price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last months and are expected to continue to fluctuate due to inflation geopolitical and economic uncertainty and regulatory and policy instability including import tariffs and trade agreements the latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of john deeres business particularly if john deere is unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other factors john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials components and whole goods has and could continue to adversely affect john deeres ability to meet commitments to customers during fiscal the supply chain challenges in combination with demand for john deeres products resulted in a heavier backend loaded year for industry retail orders as the result of the covid pandemic geopolitical instability and other global events john deere has experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials components whole goods and freight global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers ocean freight capacity constraints international port delays trucking and chassis shortages and railway and airfreight capacity which have resulted in delays shortages of key manufacturing components increased order backlogs increased transportation costs and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory which increased john deeres overall production and overhead costs in an effort to mitigate raw material shortages and supply chain constraints john deere has increased the list price of its products and worked with suppliers to ensure optimum inventory levels however if customers are unwilling to accept price increases in john deere products or john deere is unable to offset the increase in costs raw material shortages could have an adverse effect on john deeres operations continued or increased fluctuations in costs of materials or inflation generally and continued supply chain challenges could have a material adverse effect on john deeres business which could negatively impact the company resources risks the companys ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy the companys continued success depends in part on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience as well as its ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees could impair the companys ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect the companys business in addition while the company strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees the companys operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees such as those the company could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect the company through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees security breaches and other disruptions to the companys information technology infrastructure could interfere with the companys operations and could compromise the information of the company as well as its customers andor john deere dealers exposing the company to liability that could cause the companys business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of business the company relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including loan application and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of john deere equipment the company uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally the company collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of the companys customers and john deere dealers as well as personally identifiable information of the companys customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the companys business operations and strategy despite security measures including a vulnerability disclosure program and business continuity plans the companys information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals employee supplier or dealer error or malfeasance supply chain compromise disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses ransomware or other malware telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other events although the company has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in a material business impact it has from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors the occurrence of any significant event could compromise the companys networks and the information stored there could be accessed obtained publicly disclosed lost altered misused or stolen any such access disclosure alteration misuse or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings government investigations liability or regulatory penalties disruption to the companys operations and damage to the companys reputation which could adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication the company may need to invest additional resources to protect information security legal and compliance risks the companys global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations the violation of which could expose the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects the companys global operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas including advertising antimoney laundering antitrust consumer finance environmental climaterelated health and safety foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions foreign ownership and investment human rights labor and employment and data privacy these laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which the company operates compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting the companys global operations in addition the company must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and all applicable foreign anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although the company has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on the companys reputation business results of operations and financial condition changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys business by increasing compliance costs limiting the companys ability to offer a product or service requiring changes to the companys business practices or otherwise making the companys products and services less attractive to customers legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect the companys business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of the company to address these requirements could adversely affect our business the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act among others impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business legal proceedings and disputes in which the company is and may in the future be involved could harm the companys business financial condition reputation and brand the company is subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks around the world the company faces risks of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations in the ordinary course of business the most prevalent of which relate to retail credit matters the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the companys business financial condition reputation and brand the defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations such legal proceedings may also affect the companys assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments exceeding our reserves general risks john deeres and the companys reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity john deeres brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of its and the companys business john deeres reputation is critical to growing its customer base john deeres brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business including the core values of integrity quality innovation and commitment negative claims or publicity involving john deere its products or services its culture and values customer data or any of its key employees or suppliers could damage john deeres reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate damage to john deeres reputation could adversely impact its and the companys ability to attract new and maintain existing customers employees dealers and business relationships additionally negative or inaccurate postings articles or comments on social media and the internet about john deere could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of john deere the company or the john deere brand further adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against john deere or the company or by john deere or the company could also damage john deeres and the companys reputation and brand image undermine customer confidence and reduce longterm demand for john deere equipment even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to john deeres or the companys operations if the reputation culture or image of john deeres brands are damaged or john deere or the company receive negative publicity then the companys revenue financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected unexpected events have and may in the future increase the companys cost of doing business or disrupt its operations the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism epidemics and pandemics such as the covid pandemic civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which the company operates or in which john deere suppliers are located have and could in the future adversely affect the companys operations and financial performance such events have and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of john deeres manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of john deere products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deeres facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions these potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for john deeres products and the financial performance of john deeres and the companys operations
