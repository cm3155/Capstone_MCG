based upon our service finance rates charged and other finance terms in addition the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants that could be either technology partners or potential competitors the proportion of john deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by us is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment markets in the financial markets and in business generally we financed a significant portion of john deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which we operated during and we emphasize convenient service to customers and endeavor to offer terms desired in our specialized markets such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals our retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors regulation in several us states state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables the present state limitations have not significantly limited variablerate finance charges or the fixedrate finance charges established by us however if interest rate levels should increase significantly maximum state rates could affect us by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variablerate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes in some states we may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts rather than loan contracts or by using fixedrate rather than variablerate contracts in addition to rate regulations various us state and federal laws and regulations apply to some receivables and leases principally retail notes for goods sold for personal family or household use and john deere
