to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors regulation in several us states state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables the present state limitations have not thus far significantly limited variablerate finance charges or the fixedrate finance charges established by the company however if interest rate levels should increase significantly maximum state rates could affect the company by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variablerate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes in some states the company may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts rather than loan contracts or by using fixedrate rather than variablerate contracts in addition to rate regulation various us state and federal laws and regulations apply to some
