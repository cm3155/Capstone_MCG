achieve its leap ambitions trends and economic conditions our volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products the level of john deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic financial climatic legislative and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products industry sales outlook for fiscal year agriculture and turf construction and forestry john deere trends customers seek to improve profitability productivity and sustainability through technology integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend john deeres smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend the technologies that are the focus of john deeres operating model are incorporated into products within each of john deeres operating segments we expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future agriculture and turf outlook for john deere expects large and small agricultural equipment sales to be down from levels in north america europe and south america agricultural fundamentals across all of john deeres major markets are expected to moderate in due to rising global stocks lower commodity prices elevated interest rates and weather volatility in the us and canada this is partially offset by resilient farm balance sheets the us equipment fleet age is elevated for both tractors and combines however increases in used inventory levels are impacting purchasing decisions in europe the dairy and livestock sector is expected to improve due to stronger pricing amid lower feed costs while spring weather conditions have caused uncertainty about winter seeded crop yields in addition persistent elevated input costs have decreased demand in europe due to macroeconomic trends in us consumer markets including lower levels of home sales persistently higher interest rates and inventory reductions sales of compact utility tractors and riding lawn equipment continue to be lower construction and forestry outlook for construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be flat to down from levels benefits from increasing us infrastructure spending elevated manufacturing investment levels and improving single family housing starts are expected to partially offset declines in commercial real estate construction and softening rental demand roadbuilding demand remains strong in the us largely offset by softening demand in europe company trends our net income for fiscal year is expected to be higher than fiscal year primarily due to income earned on a higher average portfolio and lower dealer financing incentives partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads agricultural market business cycle the agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies these factors affect farmers income and may result in lower demand for equipment we may experience higher receivable writeoffs and losses on equipment on operating leases during unfavorable market conditions interest rates central bank policy interest rates increased in and have remained elevated most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate this receivable and lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources we also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from our receivable and lease portfolio as a result we experienced aftertax less favorable financing spreads in the first six months of compared to we expect to continue experiencing spread compression in but at a moderating pace relative to spread compression experienced in higher interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside other items of concern and uncertainties other items that could impact our results are global and regional political conditions including the ongoing war between russia and ukraine and the conflict in the middle east economic tax and trade policies new or retaliatory tariffs capital market disruptions foreign currency and capital control policies regulations and legislation regarding right to repair or right to modify weather conditions marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in john deeres and our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities automation autonomy and alternative power technologies changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment delays or disruptions in john deeres supply chain significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in the prices of many commodities and slower economic growth or recession compared with the total revenues and net income attributable to the company were as follows three months ended six months ended april april april april change change total revenues net income attributable to the company total revenues increased for the second quarter and first six months of primarily due to a percent and percent increase in average portfolio balances respectively and higher average financing rates net income for the quarter was lower than the same period in primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads mostly offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances yeartodate net income was higher due to income earned on higher average portfolio balances and lower dealer financing incentives partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads revenues finance income lease revenues and other income earned by us were as follows three months ended six months ended april april april april change change finance income earned on retail notes revolving charge accounts wholesale receivables lease revenues other income higher average portfolio balances and higher average finance rates drove increased revenues across all products for the second quarter and first six months of compared to the change was most pronounced within wholesale receivables due to an increase in average portfolio balances of percent and percent for the second quarter and first six months of respectively due to higher dealer inventory levels other income increased in the second quarter and first six months of compared to due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables from john deere yeartodate results also benefited from an international support payment from john deere as a result of foreign exchange losses in argentina due to currency devaluation revenues earned from john deere totaled for the second quarter and for the first six months of compared with and for the same periods last year respectively the increases were primarily due to increased compensation paid by john deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes driven by a higher interest rate environment in addition to higher average portfolio balances the international support payment from john deere noted above also contributed to the yeartodate increase revenues earned from john deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above expenses expenses incurred by us were as follows three months ended six months ended april april april april change change interest expense depreciation of equipment on operating leases administrative and operating expenses fees and interest paid to john deere provision for credit losses provision for income taxes the increase in interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings to fund a larger portfolio administrative and operating expenses in the second quarter and first six months of decreased compared to the same periods in due to lower dealer financing incentive program costs additionally the results for the quarter were positively impacted by lower foreign exchange losses however the yeartodate results were partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses in argentina due to currency devaluation in the first quarter of the provision for credit losses increased in the second quarter and first six months of compared with the same periods last year due to higher net writeoffs on retail notes and revolving charge accounts and an increase in allowance driven by higher expected losses on agricultural customer accounts as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions the annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average balance of total receivables was percent for the second quarter and percent for the first six months of compared with percent and percent for the same periods last year respectively the provision for income taxes decreased during the second quarter and first six months of primarily due to favorable discrete tax items and a lower effective tax rate the decrease yeartodate was partially offset by the effect of higher pretax income receivables and leases receivable and lease excluding wholesale volumes were as follows three months ended

receivables and the allowance for credit losses were as follows as a percentage of the receivables balance april october april  percent dollars percent dollars percent receivables days or more past due nonperforming receivables allowance for credit losses we monitor the credit quality of receivables based on delinquency status receivables days or more past due continue to accrue finance income we stop accruing finance income once receivables are considered nonperforming which generally occurs once receivables are days past due an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio we measure expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist risk characteristics include product category market geography credit risk and remaining balance receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis nonperforming receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses while we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing receivable portfolio different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses see note for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to at april compared with at october and at april these balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease deposits from individual john deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized
