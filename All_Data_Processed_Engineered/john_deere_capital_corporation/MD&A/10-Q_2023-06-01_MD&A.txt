worksite efficiency improve yields lower input costs and ease labor constraints john deeres leap ambitions are goals designed to boost economic value and sustainability for john deeres customers as an enabling business the company is fully integrated with john deeres smart industrial operating model and is focused on providing financial solutions to help john deere achieve its leap ambitions john deere and the company anticipate opportunities in this area as john deere the company and their customers have a vested interest in sustainable practices trends and economic conditions the companys volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products the level of john deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic financial climatic legislative and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products industry trends for fiscal year industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the us and canada for are forecasted to increase approximately percent compared to industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the us and canada are expected to be down about percent in industry sales of agricultural machinery in europe are forecasted to be flat to up percent while south american industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat in asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in on an industry basis the us and canada construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be flat to up percent in global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat john deere trends customers demand for integration of technology into equipment is a market trend underlying john deeres smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions framework customers have sought to improve profitability productivity and sustainability through technology john deeres approach to technology involves hardware and software guidance connectivity and digital solutions automation and machine intelligence machine autonomy and alternative propulsion technologies this technology is incorporated into products within each of john deeres operating segments customers continue to adopt technology integrated in the john deere portfolio of smart machines systems and solutions the company expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future demand for john deeres equipment remains strong as order books are full throughout agricultural fundamentals are expected to remain solid through and retail demand will comprise most of sales the north american retail customer fleet age of combines and large tractors is historically high and dealer inventories are low due to the manufacturing and supply chain constraints over the past few years john deere expects elevated demand to continue for the second half of the year as evidenced by retail customer orders that extend into crop prices remain favorable to john deere customers in part due to a stocktouse ratio below the 10year average for key grains john deere expects sales volume of large agricultural equipment to be greater in than in north america and europe sales volume for small agriculture and turf equipment is expected to be lower than due to lower demand for consumeroriented products partially offset by stronger demand for midsized equipment construction equipment markets are forecasted to be steady strong us infrastructure spending industrial construction and rental inventory restocking are expected to more than offset moderation in residential home and commercial real estate construction importantly construction equipment dealer inventory remains below historical averages roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the us largely offset by softening demand in europe and parts of asia supply chain conditions have improved over however john deere continues to experience disruptions above historical norms supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of john deeres business starting in including parts availability increased production costs and higher inventory levels past due deliveries from suppliers were at elevated levels during john deere implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand john deere has experienced supply chain improvements in the second quarter of the reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to higher levels of production in the second quarter of however remaining constraints in the supply base will limit higher levels of production in the second half of the year as a result the production schedules in will be more aligned with the customers seasonal use of john deeres products marking a return to historical seasonal production patterns company trends net income for the company in fiscal year is expected to be lower than fiscal year primarily due to less favorable financing spreads lower gains on operating lease dispositions a higher provision for credit losses and higher selling administrative and general expenses these factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances driven by strong demand of john deeres products throughout which is favorably impacting financing volumes central bank policy interest rates increased in the first six months of most of the companys customer receivables are fixed rate while its wholesale receivables generally are variable rate the company has both fixed and variable rate borrowings the company manages the risk of interest rate fluctuations by balancing the types and amounts of its funding sources to its receivable and lease portfolios accordingly the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure historically rising interest rates impact the companys borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the receivable and lease portfolio as a result the companys financing spread was unfavorably impacted by million aftertax in the first six months of compared to the company expects spread compression to persist during recent banking sector events have resulted in increased liquidity considerations the companys deposits are well diversified and as a result the company was not exposed to banks that have entered receivership or encountered liquidity issues these events have not changed the companys access to capital markets the company continues to monitor counterparty exposure through regular reviews of various risk metrics and by adjusting exposure limits as needed as the companys volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products supply chain disruptions could impact the companys future volumes despite supply chain challenges the companys volumes have grown and further growth is forecast in driven by strong demand for john deere equipment supply chain disruptions rising interest rates and recent banking sector events are driven by factors outside of the companys control and as a result the company cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside other items of concern and uncertainties other items of concern include global and regional political conditions failure to raise the us debt ceiling economic and trade policies imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products postpandemic effects capital market disruptions changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the prices of many commodities these items could impact the companys results john deere and the company are making investments in technology and in strengthening capabilities in digital automation autonomy and alternative propulsion technologies as with most technology investments marketplace adoption monetization and regulation of these features holds an elevated level of uncertainty financing incentives in the second quarter of the company corrected the accounting treatment for financing

lease dispositions while demand for used equipment remains strong lease gains declined during as endoflease book values are now more closely aligned with equipment sale proceeds revenues earned from john deere totaled million for the second quarter and million for the first six months of compared with million and million for the same periods last year the increase was primarily due to increased

average borrowing rates the provision for credit losses increased in the second quarter and first six months of compared with the same periods last year primarily due to favorable allowance adjustments on agricultural retail notes and finance leases in which did not recur in the current year in addition to higher net writeoffs on revolving charge accounts in the annualized provision for
