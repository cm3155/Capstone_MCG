recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes regulatory enforcement and fines have also significantly increased across the banking

governing the activities of financial institutions including nonbank financial institutions such as financial technology companies and marketplace lenders which provide products and services comparable to banking organizations including financial holding companies and bank holding companies the following discussion is general in nature and seeks to highlight some of the more significant of these regulatory requirements but does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to us and our subsidiaries doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the doddfrank act continues to have a broad impact on the financial services industry by imposing significant regulatory and compliance requirements including among other things enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies increased capital and liquidity requirements increased regulatory examination fees increased assessments banks must pay the fdic for federal deposit insurance and specific provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of bank safety and soundness and consumer practices by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities in addition the doddfrank act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that is enforced by new and existing federal regulatory agencies and authorities including the fsoc frb occ fdic and cfpb the following description briefly summarizes certain impacts of the doddfrank act on the operations and activities both currently and prospectively of fnb fnbpa and our subsidiaries and affiliates deposit insurance the doddfrank act established a deposit insurance limit for insured deposits amendments to the fdi act also revised the assessment base against which an idis deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdics dif are calculated under the amendments the fdic assessment base is no longer the institutions deposit base but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity the doddfrank act requires a phasein of the minimum designated reserve ratio for the dif increasing it from to of the estimated amount of total insured deposits which was achieved as of the third quarter of fdic regulations provide that among other things upon reaching the minimum surcharges on idis with total consolidated assets of billion or more cease the last quarterly surcharge was reflected in fnbpas december assessment invoice fnbpas assessment invoices have not included a quarterly surcharge since that time in addition the doddfrank act eliminated the requirement for the fdic to pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds the fdic may pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds but the fdic has sole discretion to determine whether to suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends from the dif the fdic has set the target designated reserve ratio at since assessment rates which declined for all banks when the reserve ratio first surpassed in the third quarter of increased for all insurance depository institutions by basis points in the first quarter of the increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the dif reaches the statutory minimum of by the statutory deadline of september assessment rates will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds in addition the tax cuts and jobs act of tcja disallows the deduction of fdic deposit insurance premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of billion or more for banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as fnbpa the premium deduction is phasedout based on the proportion of the banks assets exceeding billion the fdic issued a final rule in november to implement a special assessment on banks with over billion in total assets to recover the loss to the dif associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank during the first quarter of the special assessment rate is basis points and will be paid over eight quarters beginning in june our total assessment accrued and expensed during totaled million the special assessment is not considered an fdic premium under the tcja and therefore is tax deductible for federal income tax purposes after eight quarters there is a possibility for the fdic to impose a onetime shortfall special assessment if the amount collected by the special assessment does not meet the final loss amounts of silicon valley bank and signature bank after the termination of the receiverships brokered deposits section of the fdi act and fdic regulations issued thereunder limit the ability of an idi such as fnbpa to accept renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the idi is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described below or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic in addition idis that are less than wellcapitalized are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that they may pay on deposits the characterization of deposits as brokered may result in the imposition of higher deposit assessments on such deposits as mandated by the economic growth act the fdic adopted a final rule in february to include a limited exception for reciprocal deposits for idis that are wellmanaged and wellcapitalized or adequately capitalized and have obtained a waiver from the fdic as mentioned above under the limited exception qualified idis like fnbpa are able to exclude from treatment as brokered deposits up to billion or of the institutions total liabilities in reciprocal deposits which is defined as deposits received by a financial institution through a deposit placement network with the same maturity if any in the same aggregate amount as deposits placed by the institution in other network member banks on december the fdic issued a final rule amending its brokered deposit regulations the rule sought to clarify and modernize the fdics regulatory framework for brokered deposits notable aspects of the rule include i defining the operative prongs of the definition of a deposit broker ii the identification of a number of business relationships in which the agent or nominee is automatically not deemed to be a deposit broker because their primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions iii the establishment of a more transparent application process for entities that seek to rely upon the primary purpose exception but do not qualify for one of the identified business relationships to which the exception is automatically applicable and iv the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive depositplacement arrangement with one idi are not considered a deposit broker the final rule took effect on april and full compliance was required by january interest on demand deposits under the doddfrank act depository institutions are permitted to pay interest on demand deposits in accordance therewith we pay interest on certain classes of commercial demand deposits volcker rule section of the doddfrank act known as the volcker rule prohibits idis and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except under limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of of tier capital in private equity and hedge funds the volcker rule regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for their own accounts and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds which are referred to as covered funds the volcker rule regulations are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions the volcker rule regulations also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the volcker rule which must include for the largest entities making regular reports about those activities to the entitys regulators effective january the volcker rule regulations were amended to specify that compliance requirements are based on the amount of assets and liabilities that an idi trades idis with significant trading activities ie those with billion or more in trading assets and liabilities have heightened compliance obligations compliance with the revised volcker rule regulations was required on january in july the occ amended the volcker rule regulations to streamline the covered funds portion addressing the treatment of certain foreign funds and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other permissible activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address principally this amendment permits banks to engage in certain lowrisk fund activities that do not present the risks that the volcker rule was intended to address the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpbs responsibility is to establish implement and enforce laws rules and regulations under certain federal consumer financial laws as defined by the doddfrank act and interpreted by the cfpb with respect to the conduct of both bank and nonbank providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking and enforcement authority under many of the statutes that govern products and services banks offer to consumers the cfpb has authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products and services in and continuing into the cfpb has taken an increasingly aggressive approach and expanded its reach and has made it clear that the cfpb is interpreting its statutory authorities broadly to expand the cfpbs ability to pursue violations of the consumer financial and fair lending laws in consumer financial markets including issuing guidance indicating certain bank overdraft and mortgage lending practices constitute violations of the unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices statute in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection regulations that are more stringent than the regulations promulgated by the cfpb and state attorneys general have the authority to enforce consumer protection rules that the cfpb adopts against statechartered institutions and against with respect to certain nonpreempted laws national banks compliance with any such new regulation or other precedent established by the cfpb andor states could reduce our revenue increase our cost of operations and compliance and limit prevent or make more costly our ability to expand into certain products and services over the past several years the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and nonbank financial institutions to enforce federal consumer financial laws other federal financial regulatory agencies including the occ as well as state attorneys general and state banking agencies and other state financial regulators also have been increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements debit card interchange fees the frb pursuant to its authority under the doddfrank act has implemented rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion adopting a pertransaction interchange cap base of plus of the transaction total and an additional one cent to account for fraud protection costs in october the frb proposed to lower the base component of regulated debit from  to  in addition the ad valorem component would decline to basis points from its current rate of basis points however the fraudprevention adjustment would increase from  to  the maximum permissible interchange fee for a debit card transaction would be  under the proposal down from  under the current rule the frb is also proposing that the interchange rate cap will be automatically updated every two years based on the data collected from issuers transactions with affiliates pursuant to sections and of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between banks and their nonbank affiliates in general banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving nonbank affiliates also transactions between banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on armslength terms and consistent with safe and sound banking practices the doddfrank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under sections and of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include the borrowing or lending of securities or derivative transactions and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained in addition the provisions of the volcker rule apply similar restrictions on transactions between a bank and any covered fund that the bank advises or sponsors transactions with insiders the doddfrank act expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and extending the types of transactions subject to the various requirements to include derivative transactions repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions the doddfrank act also places restrictions on certain asset sales to and from an insider of an idi including requirements that such sales be on market terms and in certain circumstances receive the approval of the idis board of directors enhanced lending limits federal banking law limits a national banks ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons to an amount that does not exceed certain thresholds among other things the doddfrank act expanded the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions the changes resulting from the doddfrank act continue to impact our profitability including limitations on fee income opportunities increased compliance costs imposition of more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements that affect our business we cannot predict what effect any newly implemented presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations may have on us capital and operational requirements the frb occ and fdic issued substantially similar riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to us banking organizations in addition these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels due to its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth fnb like other bank holding companies is required to maintain cet1 tier and total capital the sum of tier and tier capital equal to at least and respectively of our total riskweighted assets including various offbalance sheet items the riskbased capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies to account for offbalance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets assets and offbalance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with appropriate weights the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total riskweighted assets and offbalance sheet items at december our cet1 tier and total capital ratios under these guidelines were and respectively at december we had million of capital securities and subordinated debt that qualified as tier capital in addition the frb has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies these guidelines currently provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets less goodwill and certain other intangible assets the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria including the highest regulatory rating the guidelines also provide that bank holding companies depending on the types quality and quantity of risk associated with its activities eg acquisitions internal growth will be expected to maintain strong capital positions above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets our leverage ratio at december was increased capital standards and enhanced supervision the doddfrank acts regulatory capital requirements are intended to ensure that financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during future periods of financial distress and requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements on a consolidated basis for idis their holding companies and nonbank financial companies that have been determined to be systemically important by the fsoc basel iii capital rules the frb the occ and the fdic have adopted riskbased capital regulations implementing certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the basel iii framework these regulations were initially implemented in to strengthen the components of regulatory capital increase riskbased capital requirements and to make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets in general subject to certain exceptions as discussed further below minimum capital standards established under the riskbased capital regulations include a cet1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent a tier capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent a total capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent and a tier capital to adjusted average total assets leverage ratio of percent in determining the amount of riskweighted assets for purposes of calculating riskbased capital ratios all assets including certain offbalance sheet assets for example recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests are multiplied by a riskweight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk cet1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity and retained earnings tier capital is generally defined as cet1 and additional tier capital additional tier capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries total capital includes tier capital cet1 capital plus additional tier capital and tier capital tier capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements and may include cumulative preferred stock and longterm perpetual preferred stock mandatory convertible securities intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt also included in tier capital is the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of percent of riskweighted assets calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations in assessing an institutions capital adequacy the occ takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary in addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements the capital regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum riskbased capital requirements through subsequent rulemaking the federal banking agencies provided certain forms of relief to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital rules advanced approaches such as fnb for instance nonadvanced approaches institutions such as fnb and fnbpa are subject to a more simple regulatory capital treatment for msas certain dtas arising from temporary differences investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and requirements for the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties sometimes referred to as a minority interest that is includable in regulatory capital in addition certain general requirements of the capital regulations have been eliminated in respect of nonadvanced approaches institutions including i the cet1 capital deduction threshold that applies individually to msas temporary difference dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock ii the aggregate cet1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items iii the cet1 capital deduction threshold for nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and iv the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock accordingly banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule may deduct from cet1 capital any amount of msas temporary difference dtas and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds of cet1 capital management believes that as of december fnb and fnbpa meet all capital adequacy requirements under basel iii the basel committee on banking supervision published the last version of the basel iii accord in generally referred to as basel iv the basel committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of riskweighted assets which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk which will facilitate the comparability of banks capital ratios constraining the use of internally modeled approaches and complementing the riskweighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor leadership of the frb occ and fdic who are tasked with implementing basel iv supported the revisions although it is uncertain at this time we anticipate some if not all of the basel iv accord may be incorporated into the regulatory capital requirements framework applicable to fnb and fnbpa in august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule providing banking institutions that had adopted the cecl accounting standard in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay ie a fiveyear transition in total in connection with its adoption of cecl on january fnb elected to utilize the fiveyear cecl transition in addition the federal banking agencies continue to review bank capital requirements in light of the finalization of the basel iii framework by the basel committee on banking supervision no proposals for any of the components of finalizing the basel iii framework has yet been published by the agencies on september the us banking agencies issued a press release reaffirming their commitment to implementing enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the final set of basel iii standards and stating that they are currently developing a joint proposed rule for issuance as soon as possible stress testing as part of the regulatory relief provided by the economic growth act the asset threshold requiring idis to conduct and report to their primary federal bank regulators annual companyrun stress tests was raised from billion to billion in total consolidated assets and makes the requirement periodic rather than annual the economic growth act also provided that bank holding companies under billion in assets were no longer subject to stress testing requirements and provided the frb with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than billion in total assets to enhanced supervision notwithstanding these amendments the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency bank regulatory guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process we continue to monitor and stress test our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of our banking regulators prompt corrective action fdicia among other things classifies idis into five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for idis that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the category in which an institution is classified failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capitalraising requirements restrictions on its business and a variety of enforcement remedies including the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and in certain circumstances the appointment of a conservator or receiver an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that banks compliance with the plan the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of of the banks assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan furthermore in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company the obligation under such guarantee would take priority over the parents general unsecured creditors in addition fdicia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against an idi that does not meet such standards the various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by fdicia using the total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital cet1 and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized under the regulations a wellcapitalized institution must have a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of at least a tier riskbased capital ratio of at least a total riskbased capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order under these guidelines fnbpa was considered wellcapitalized as of december when determining the adequacy of an idis capital federal regulators must also take into consideration a concentrations of credit risk b interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institutions assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its offbalance sheet position and c risks from nontraditional activities as well as an institutions ability to manage those risks this evaluation is made as part of the idis regular safety and soundness examination in addition any idi with significant trading activity must incorporate a measure for market risk in their regulatory capital calculations community reinvestment act and fair lending the cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices under the cra each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by among other things providing credit to and investments in low and moderateincome individuals and communities depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the cra and are assigned ratings in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhc act or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the bhc act each idi subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra in its most recent cra examination fnbpa received an outstanding rating furthermore federal banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering acquisitions of control and new activities fnb is one of fewer than percent of banks to receive the highest possible cra rating the outstanding cra rating reaffirms our success in fulfilling our strategic and cultural commitment to supporting traditionally underserved communities fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services and the enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the cfpb hud and other regulators fair lending laws include the equal credit opportunity act ecoa and the fair housing act which outlaw discrimination in credit and residential real estate transactions on the basis of prohibited factors including among others race color national origin gender and religion a lender may be liable for policies that result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers moreover in the cfpb issued an advisory opinion and amended its examination procedures to assert that the ecoa applies to all phases of the loan cycle and asserted its authority to determine that violations of the fair lending laws may also constitute a violation of the unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices acts if a pattern or practice of lending discrimination is alleged by a regulator then that agency may refer the matter to the doj for investigation the doj and cfpb have a memorandum of understanding under which the agencies have agreed to share information coordinate investigations and have generally committed to strengthen their coordination efforts the current presidential administration has indicated a focus on prioritizing enforcement of the federal antidiscrimination laws and as a result the cfpb may adopt more strict antidiscrimination enforcement policies in the area of fair lending loan servicing collections and other consumerrelated areas in october the doj announced an initiative to combat redlining through utilization of its fair lending prosecutorial authority and has announced the settlement of a number of bank investigations concerning redlining and other violations of the fair lending laws including a february announcement that yadkin bank yadkin and its successor by merger fnbpa reached a settlement with the doj and the state of north carolina to resolve their fair lending allegations related to the assessment of mortgage lending activities during a fiveyear period in the winstonsalem and charlotte north carolina majority black and hispanic census tracts mbhcts that began prior to yadkins merger with the fnbpa in march fnbpa is required to have a fair lending program that is of sufficient scope to monitor fair lending and that appropriately remediates issues which were identified during the doj investigation as well as add additional branches increase marketing and mortgage and home equity loan subsidies in these mbhcts on may the federal banking agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the regulations implementing the cra under the proposed rule the agencies would evaluate bank performance across the varied activities they conduct and the communities in which they operate and tailor cra evaluations and data collection based on bank size and type further the agencies would also emphasize smaller value loans and investments that may have a greater impact on and be more responsive to the needs of low and moderateincome lmi persons and would update cra assessment areas to include activities associated with online and mobile banking branchless banking and hybrid models in addition the proposed rule would establish a metricsbased approach to cra evaluations of retail lending and community development financing activities including through the establishment of public benchmarks and would clarify eligible cra activities such as affordable housing that are focused on lmi underserved and rural communities the prospects and timing for the adoption by the agencies of a final rule are not certain at this time financial privacy in accordance with the glb act federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks financial institutions and third parties that are not financial institutions but that receive nonpublic personal information from nonaffiliated banks and financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors cybersecurity the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a banking organizations board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management processes related to information technology and operational resiliency and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services in october the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more however it is possible that if these enhanced standards are implemented the occ will consider them in connection with the examination and supervision of banks below the billion threshold the federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards the occ however as part of its bank supervision operational plan has prioritized review of national banks information security data protection and thirdparty risk management including the extent to which national banks are positioned to assess the evolving cyberthreat environment and maintain resilient defenses against such threats on november the federal financial regulatory agencies published a final rule that will impose upon banking organizations and their nonaffiliated service providers new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents specifically the final rule requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than hours after the discovery of a computer security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident within the meaning attributed to those terms by the final rule banks nonaffiliated service providers are required under the final rule to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services as soon as possible after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services provided to such bank for as much as four hours the final rule took effect on april and banks and their nonaffiliated service providers had to be in compliance with the requirements of the rule by may further in the enactment of the strengthening american cybersecurity act saca and the sec proposed rules to enhance disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management strategy governance and incident reporting are designed to standardize cybersecurity processes and disclosure requirements saca requires critical infrastructure companies such as financial institutions to report significant cyberincidents and all ransom payments to the us department of homeland securitys cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa the definition of a covered cyberincident will be determined by cisa rulemaking but the act provides that at a minimum an incident must be reported if it causes a substantial loss of confidentiality integrity or availability of information or a serious impact on the safety and resiliency of operational systems and processes causes a disruption of business or industrial operations including due to a denial of service attack ransomware attack or exploitation of a zero day vulnerability or involves unauthorized access or disruption of business or industrial operations due to a compromise of a cloud service provider managed service provider or other thirdparty data hosting provider or by a supply chain compromise in july the sec adopted a final rule requiring mandatory annual disclosures of companies cybersecurity risk management policies including board oversight of cybersecurity risks as well as mandatory reporting of material cybersecurity incidents antimoney laundering initiatives and the usa patriot act a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of usa patriot act which amended the bank secrecy act of bsa substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the ust has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as fnbpa these regulations require financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers these regulations include express requirements regarding riskbased procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence such procedures require banks to take appropriate steps to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships in addition absent an applicable exclusion banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers at the time a new account is established the failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations could have serious legal including criminal law enforcement and reputational consequences for the institution on january congress passed the national defense authorization act which enacted the most significant overhaul of the bsa and related antimoney laundering laws since the usa patriot act notable amendments include i significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information and the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry maintained by the usts financial crime enforcement network fincen ii enhanced whistleblower provisions iii increased penalties for violations of the bsa iv improvements to existing informationsharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to suspicious activity reports with certain foreign branches subsidiaries and affiliates and v expanded duties and powers of fincen many of the amendments require the ust and fincen to promulgate rules on september fincen issued a final regulation implementing the beneficial owner information boi reporting requirements on december fincen published a final rule that establishes standards for financial institutions and government entities to access boi reported to fincen office of foreign assets control regulation the us has instituted economic sanctions which affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the ofac rules because they are administered by the ust office of foreign assets control ofac the ofacadministered sanctions target countries in various ways generally however they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions which relate to investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets such as property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences consumer protection statutes and regulations in addition to the consumer regulations promulgated by the frb occ and state agencies and the regulations issued by the cfpb pursuant to its authority under the doddfrank act fnbpa is subject to various federal consumer protection statutes including the tila truth in savings act equal credit opportunity act ecoa fair housing act respa fair debt collection practices act fair credit reporting act electronic fund transfer act and home mortgage disclosure act cra and regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder by the cfpb and the federal banking agencies among other things these laws and regulations require banks to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction prohibit discrimination in housingrelated lending activities require banks to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects require lenders to provide borrowers with more detailed information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations require prescribed consumer disclosures and the adoption of error resolution procedures and other consumer protection protocols with respect to electronic fund transfers and prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with consumer loans the collection of debt and the provision of other consumer financial products and services in april the occ issued final guidance on overdraft protection programs this guidance addresses certain practices that may result in heightened risk exposure including the risk of violating section of the ftc act section which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices4 and section of the consumer financial protection act of which prohibits unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices these practices include assessing overdraft fees on debit card transactions that are authorized when a consumers available account balance is positive but later post to the account when the available balance is negative also referred to as authorize positive settle negative apsn and assessing an additional fee each time a third party resubmits the same transaction for payment after a bank returns the transaction for nonsufficient funds nsf referred to as representment fees the guidance also describes certain practices that may help to manage risks associated with overdraft protection programs including assisting consumers in avoiding unduly high costs in relation to the face value of the item being presented the amount of their regular deposits and their average account balances and implementing fees and practices that bear a reasonable relationship to the risks and costs of providing overdraft protection program services we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with the aboveidentified consumer requirements pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a bank holding company such as fnb if the conduct or threatened conduct including any acts or omissions of such holding company poses a risk to the dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is in generally sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on fnb and fnbpas operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from evolving future consumer and fair lending regulations community reinvestment act federal regulators issued a joint final rule that makes extensive amendments to the regulations that implement the cra the agencies stated goal in issuing the final rule is to strengthen and modernize the cra regulations which have not been significantly revised in nearly three decades under the new requirements fnb would be subject to new performance tests that would make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory or outstanding rating the final rule also establishes new standardized metrics and quantitative standards for evaluating banks cra performance under various performance tests the new requirements will be an extensive overhaul of the current data collection calculations and reporting under the existing cra rule and would require additional costs to come into compliance most of the final rules requirements will be effective beginning january additional requirements including new data reporting requirements will be applicable on january dividend restrictions our primary source of funds for cash distributions to our stockholders and funds used to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness is dividends received from fnbpa fnbpa is subject to federal laws and regulations governing its ability to pay dividends to fnb including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums under federal law the amount of dividends that a national bank such as fnbpa may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of its net income for the current year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years the occ has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank on the basis that paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings in addition to dividends from fnbpa other sources of parent company liquidity for fnb include cash shortterm investments and issuance of debt instruments as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries in addition the ability of fnb and fnbpa to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements previously described in the capital and operational requirements basel iii capital rules and stress testing discussions herein and the capital and noncapital standards established under fdicia as described above the right of fnb our stockholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries source of strength according to the doddfrank act and frb policy a financial or bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary consistent with the source of strength policy the frb has stated that as a matter of prudent banking a bank or financial holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with our capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition this support may be required at times when the parent holding company may not be able to provide such support in addition if fnbpa was no longer wellcapitalized and wellmanaged within the meaning of the bhc act and frb rules which take into consideration capital ratios examination ratings and other factors the expedited processing of certain types of frb applications would not be available to us moreover examination ratings of or lower unsatisfactory ratings capital ratios below wellcapitalized levels regulatory concerns regarding management controls assets operations or other factors can all potentially result in the loss of financial holding company status practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank or financial holding company to engage in new activities grow acquire new businesses repurchase its stock or pay dividends or continue to conduct existing activities financial holding company status and activities under the bhc act an eligible bank holding company may elect to be a financial holding company and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for banks and bank holding companies fnb is a financial holding company under the bhc act the financial holding company may engage directly or through a subsidiary in certain statutorily authorized activities subject to certain restrictions and limitations imposed by the doddfrank act a financial holding company may also engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature incidental to such financial activity or with prior frb approval complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution or to the financial system generally in addition to these activities a financial holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company for a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status all of its subsidiary us depository institutions must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the frb generally must deny expanded authority to any bank holding company with a subsidiary idi that received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent cra review as of the time it submits its request for financial holding company status if after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company under the bhc act the company fails to continue to meet any of the requirements for financial holding company status the company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements if the company does not return to compliance within days the frb may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company activities and acquisitions the bhc act requires a bank or financial holding company to obtain the prior approval of the frb before the company may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association if after such acquisition the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than of any class of voting securities of the institution any of the companys subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association or the company may merge or consolidate with any other bank or financial holding company the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate banking act generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a holding company of banks in more than one state a bank is subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating in for a minimum period of time and the requirement that the bank holding company after the proposed transaction controls no more than of the total amount of deposits of idis in the us and no more than or such lesser or greater amount set by the state law of such deposits in that state the interstate banking act also permits a bank to merge with an outofstate bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank a bank to acquire branches from an outofstate bank and a bank to establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the host state permits de novo branching of its own statechartered banks bank and financial holding companies and banks seeking to engage in mergers authorized by the interstate banking act must be at least adequately capitalized as of the date that the application is filed and the resulting institution must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged upon consummation of the transaction pursuant to the doddfrank act national and statechartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state eg a host state by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the occ the change in bank control act prohibits a person entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert from acquiring control of a bank holding company or bank unless the frb has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction under current frb regulations the acquisition of or more but less than of the voting stock of a corporation would under the circumstances set forth in the regulations create a rebuttable presumption of acquisition of control of the corporation effective september the frb finalized a rule to codify and simplify its interpretations regarding regulatory presumptions of control for the purpose of the bhc act and on march the frb published interpretive guidance regarding the rule and related regulatory control matters the amended control rule thus far has had and will likely continue to have a meaningful impact on control determinations related to investments in banks and bank holding companies and investments by bank holding companies in nonbank companies incentive compensation guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the fdi act prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice the federal banking agencies also jointly adopted the guidance on sound incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking this guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to expose the organization to material amounts of risk either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide employee incentives that appropriately balance risk in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation any deficiencies in the compensation practices of fnb or its subsidiaries and affiliates could lead to supervisory or enforcement action section of the doddfrank act requires the federal banking agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities such as fnb having at least billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risktaking by providing an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity in addition these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentivebased compensation arrangements in october the sec adopted a final regulation implementing the incentivebased recovery or clawback provisions of the doddfrank act the final regulation directed stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentivebased compensation paid to current or former executive officers in the event of material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws even if there was no misconduct or failure of oversight on the part of an individual executive officer and to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies we timely adopted an executive compensation clawback policy in order to comply with this regulation and the listing standards of the nyse and a copy of the policy is filed as an exhibit to this annual report incentive compensation and sales practices particularly in connection with certain products and services that are viewed as highrisk from a supervisory perspective such as crossselling and overdraft services continue to be priority issues on the examination and supervision agendas of the cfpb and the federal banking agencies the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on executive compensation may

risks on the banks financial condition operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic
