corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will review the first quarters financial results and walk through our second quarter and full year guidance total loans and leases ended the quarter at billion a annualized linked quarter increase driven by growth of million in consumer loans and million in commercial loans and leases residential mortgages led consumer loan growth driven by onbalance sheet production this quarter in physicians and jumbo mortgage loans total deposits ended the quarter at billion a slight increase of million linked quarter even with the headwind of seasonal deposit outflows for context our seasonal deposits peaked in midnovember and troughed in midfebruary and balances should continue to build through the next couple of quarters benefiting from normal seasonality and our teams success driving deeper market penetration on an organic basis as of march noninterestbearing deposits comprised of total deposits maintaining the same level as yearend while the deposit mix continues to shift from low interest checking and savings products into higher yielding cd and money market products we believe we will continue to outperform the industry in both the mix and deposit cost perspective our deposit cost ended the first quarter at leading to a total cumulative deposit beta of since the current interest rate increases began in march of the first quarters net interest margin was a decline of only basis points a 15basispoint increase in the total yield on earning assets to was slightly more than offset by 19basispoint increase in the total cost of funds to on a monthly basis net interest margin was down a modest 1basispoint per month during the first quarter and marchs net interest margin was net interest income totaled million a million decrease from the prior quarter with over half the difference due to the current quarter having one less day turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled a robust million with linked quarter growth in nearly every line of business wealth management revenues increased compared to the prior quarter reaching a record million through continued strong contributions across the geographic footprint mortgage banking operations totaled million the highest quarterly figure since with our focus on the purchase market driving good production growth several of the lines of business vince mentioned had strong performance this quarter our debt capital markets platform which is part of capital markets had a record number of bond transactions this quarter and more than double the prior record treasury management revenues have gained momentum as we execute on our strategic initiatives building out the platform with total tm revenues increasing around from the yearago quarter driving the increase in the service charge line item operating noninterest expense totaled million an increase of million sic million from the prior quarter after adjusting for million of significant items in the current quarter and million last quarter this quarters significant items included million of branch consolidation expenses and million estimated for the additional fdic special assessment partially offset by million reduction to the previously estimated loss on the indirect auto loan sale that closed in february the largest driver for operating noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits which increased million primarily related to normal seasonal longterm compensation expense of million seasonally higher fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 employerpaid payroll taxes which increased million and reduced salary deferrals given seasonally lower loan origination volumes as previously mentioned fnb redeemed all of our outstanding series e perpetual preferred stock on february and paid the final preferred dividend of million on the redemption date the excess of the redemption value over the carrying value on the preferred stock of million was considered a significant item impacting earnings fnb continues to actively manage our capital position for ample flexibility to grow the balance sheet and optimize shareholder returns while appropriately managing risk our financial performance and capital management strategy resulted in our tce ratio reaching and cet1 ratio at both record levels tangible book value per common share was at march an increase of or compared to march aoci reduced the tangible book value per common share by as of quarter end compared to for the yearago quarter lets now look at guidance for the second quarter and full year of we are maintaining our full year balance sheet guidance we project period ending loans to grow midsingle digits on a full year basis as we increase our market share across our diverse geographic footprint and total projected deposit balances are expected to grow lowsingle digits on a yearoveryear spot basis overall our projected fullyear income statement guide is consistent with last quarter with some additional thoughts on where we expect to land within the provided ranges our projected full year net interest income is still expected to be between billion and billion assuming two 25basispoint rate cuts occurring in the latter half of our current expectation is to be in the lower half of the fullyear guide given those two rate cuts but where we ultimately end up in the range may change due to the fluidity of the rate environment and the number and timing of interest rate cuts that actually occur second quarter net interest income is projected between million and million the noninterest income fullyear guide remains between million and million however given the strong momentum in the first quarter we anticipate being in the upper half of that range the second quarter noninterest income guide is between million and million full year guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between million and million with the second quarter noninterest expense expected to be between million to million fullyear provision guidance is million to million and is dependent on net loan growth and chargeoff activity lastly the fullyear effective tax rate should be between and which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb had a good start to the year and we are optimistic that as we enter the second half of the year we have the potential to return to positive operating leverage and benefit from a more favorable interest rate environment as well as a growing pipeline for loans and deposits fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript

quarter given the difficult operating environment and i look forward to working together to build on our momentum throughout the year question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen at this time well begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead with your question frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning just vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co on the nii well on the nii guide and also on the loantodeposit ratio i think in the past youve talked about as you get up to taking some potential actions to help mitigate getting up to loantodeposit ratio and so i know theres some seasonality on the deposit side but just curious maybe if you could talk about what some of those actions might be i know you had the indirect sale indirect auto sale which i guess helped a bit but just curious if you could talk about what some of those potential actions might look like and then also just remind us of what you get on a 25basispoint cut in interest rates thanks vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i would say on the loantodeposit ratio frank weve historically talked about kind of a level where weve taken action and the action was leveraging our franchise we have to generate deposit so that time that had happened we generated close to billion in cds to kind of bring it back down into the kind of indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 the is a line but is a line that we would kind of manage and we kind of managed it down and theres a lot of things we can do i mean as you know we have a big focus on generating deposit demand deposits throughout the company our traditional commercial businesses treasury management small business its a focus throughout the company its always been so generating additional deposits bringing in new households new customer commercial clients is a key part of it and then also things like managing the book audio gap weve adjusted our pricing strategy kind of midyear last year to create more saleable product out of our originations than what weve had them before and now were up in the mid for saleable percentage where we were let alone in the so thats another lever we have and the indirect business while we did a sale we also have a lever there as far as how much we want to grow at this point in time depending on kind of whats the shelf space on the balance sheet gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania there are a whole list of things if we look at both asset and liability so theres a vince mentioned many of them i think our pipeline for new production is pretty strong from a deposit perspective so i dont think that were worried about that so obviously in the event that we need to generate deposits theres pricing mechanisms that we could deploy but we prefer to grow organically and try to bring in a balanced mix and deposits that are accretive that is going very well for the companies frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great and then just on the nii side i mean i guess you have one less rate cut baked into your expectations now but guiding towards the lower half of the previous range is that just given where you sit in the first quarter and then the trends from here or i guess i would be i assume you still pick up a little bit potentially from less rate cuts baked into your guide so just curious the driver there vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania you mentioned it pretty well frank actually indiscernible the key drivers i mean in our guidance in january we had three cuts one of them was december so december falls off which doesnt have much of an impact to the full year so the two cuts we have in the second half of the year in the shortterm is positive given were still in an assetsensitive position weve been organically moving back towards neutral so in the short term theres a benefit from having that cut the guide we adjusted in the first quarter we were at the lower end of our range for net interest income the timing of our seasonal deposits average borrowings were a little higher just because of the timing of that but by the end of the quarter we were back to flat up a little bit so kind of just capturing that first quarter as we look ahead and now theres well see interest rate environment is very fluid theres potential for us to beat that if the loan growth is stronger thats kind of what baked in there theres opportunity for us to be above that but just kind of where we sit how we started the year we thought it was appropriate to kind of guide and its the bottom half its not the bottom of the range its kind of the lower half of the range is what we had guided to frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 right okay and then just so to confirm there youd be the third rate cut was late in the year really didnt so going from three to two rate cuts really just doesnt have an impact given the timing of the rate cuts vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks good morning guys i guess first just wanted to dig into the office loans appreciate the detail you guys gave there and you touched on it in your comments the delinquency in the npls for the office loans came down in the quarter i guess first i was just wondering if there was anything in particular that happened that drove that there were sales or what and then just curious on the small increase in the criticized portion of the office loans if theres any other details you can provide there thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah daniel the slight increase was really one credit that we moved into that category at this point its not a concern for us its a credit that is extended out already another five years it was originally underwritten at ltv and its fixed through a swap at so they had one tenant move out theyre working on replacing that but we felt its appropriate naturally to replace that in a rated credit situation the ltv on it was like i said right at about going into the indiscernible so that increased that criticized to right around in terms of the portfolio the portfolio in office was down million in exposure and down million from a balance perspective so we have seen some loans payoff in that category as were managing that book of business and with the performance of it where we sit today at those very low levels well continue to be aggressive around it and manage it appropriately daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great color appreciate that and then maybe vince on the swaps that you have in place that are going to impact just curious if you could provide a little color on how much impact that you expect those the rolling off to potentially have on the margin in fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania theres billion billion of swaps we have that will mature throughout billion actually within and those are we have received rates are around basis points to currently and we put those on a while ago roughly we didnt do a lot of it but we had some of that that we did put on so that negative drag will come off really starting in january theres million that comes off in january and then the rest of them by october the rest of the billion kind of rolls off so thatll be additive i cant do that math in my head but its next year daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay so million in january and then the last billion in october thats it for me i appreciate the color thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks danny operator and our next question comes from kelly motta from kbw please go ahead with your question kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for the question gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was hoping to dig in a bit more into your fee guidance how you notably took that to the upper half of the range just wondering which areas have been performing a bit better than maybe you had expected at this time last quarter and where you see the greatest opportunities to continue to pick up some nice fee diversification and help with fee growth fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah you hit the nail on the head diversification is the answer weve built out a pretty broad set of feebased businesses over the last decade capital markets i mentioned in the prepared comments we added a debt capital markets platform so we could participate in bond economics for some of our larger clients and as you know the capital markets opened up and there was quite a bit of activity there in the first quarter so we benefited from that business unit that we built out a few years ago syndications ebbs and flows but as the pipelines build our pipelines are up about i would expect there to be more syndications activity as we move through the latter half of the year so well get some benefit there we have a pretty robust derivatives program where we have structuring teams in the marketplace that provide counsel to clients and help them address interest rate risk and that particular group did pretty well this quarter so surprisingly given the rate environment they were able to do some interesting things for clients to help them as we move through this volatile rate cycle the mortgage company one of the strategies we mentioned is kind of goes back to frank schiraldis comment about the balance sheet and how we manage loantodeposit ratios but we became much more aggressive on saleable mortgage loan pricing we gave up a little bit of margin but quite a bit off the balance sheet so theyre contributing from a pure volume perspective because were positioned in some very attractive markets to continue to see a lot of purchase money activity where in our legacy markets theres not a lot of inventories were not seeing a lot of action but in the other markets in the southeast and the midatlantic regions weve seen quite a bit of pickup so thats contributed sba had a very solid quarter some of the loans that we originated with higher yields in the construction phase that were built basically based on building something out or had construction draws associated with them became saleable so we moved some of that off with a decent gain and then the treasury management business that weve been talking about we received a lot of greenwich awards for treasury management over the last few years in the small business and middle market segments in particular we continue to build out that business unit weve added personnel we built out our merchant services business so were getting nice contributions from merchant and kind of the strategy here was to offset the consumer fees that we see declining like overdraft fees and other fee with higher value fees for customers from our that sort of premium but we kind of focused on building that out from a treasury management perspective and then going after small businesses we have to small businesses in our portfolio and we have a tremendous opportunity to go in and drive a broader relationship through the estore so were now focusing on building out a bundled product for small business thatll include treasury management and merchant as part of the bundle so those are the things that i mean theres a lot of work that goes into it weve got quite a bit of granularity and it gives us confidence that we can hit the upper end of the range on the guide i think its million right ph is that what you said kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so yeah so its annualizing the first quarter which usually the first quarter is weak weaker than others so were pretty pleased with where we sit kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no i really appreciate all the color thank you so much maybe a last question for me switching back to the balance sheet is on deposit it seems like if im reading your prepared commentary correctly some of the kind of qualification to nii to lower half of the range has to do with what youre seeing on the deposit flow side so can you remind me the seasonality you have with deposits and is there any color you can provide as to the cadence of what youre thinking about in terms of customer deposit growth to get to that lowsingle digit range that you reiterated vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think first of all there is an extreme amount of seasonality within the deposit portfolio so its kind of difficult to look at the first quarter and draw conclusions between the outflows and inflows that are occurring throughout the quarter and really it starts build now so were starting to see considerable indiscernible the demand deposits were pretty steady at about i think right on a quarteroverquarter basis so imagine thats the core of our profitability its basically maintaining those noninterestbearing deposits whats happened over the last few quarters is weve seen some of the higher priced deposit categories moving into cds or moving into something with a little bit of term within the customer base so thats eroded a little bit of the net interest income right we saw that happen thats not surprising you can see it in the escalation in the betas i believe that over time throughout the course of this year we should be able to manage the noninterest bearing deposit balances within that range and grow the other categories without sacrificing margin because weve seen some lower pricing stick in the marketplace we ph have to be as hot on the pricing so i think that should help us as we move through the rest of the year and then also the inflows that occur in many instances even with the municipal deposits this is the truth for just about all of them we dont do those transactions with municipalities to just get our balances we kind of have a rule here where we have to be the primary disbursement bank for those entities and what ends up happening is the increased activity with ach activity and wire activity and the movement of funds increasing the amount of free balances grow to cover those services so thats part of what happens over the course of the next three quarters as well fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 well anyway vince i dont know if you want to add anything on the timing vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i really vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible from a margin perspective vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania probably commented on it kind of troughs in midfebruary and build through october and november its kind of that the cadence of that thats all i would add vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you so much i appreciate the color ill step back vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator operator instructions next in line we have nick lorenzoni from stephens please go ahead with your question nick lorenzoni q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys filling in for russell gunther i just had a quick question with regard to your office portfolio i appreciate the color in the deck but was wondering if you could provide some additional detail on the geographic breakdown including specific office exposure in your dc and baltimore markets fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the exposure in dc we have essentially one transaction in the dc market we had a few on top of that over the last year weve been able to move those off the balance sheet just in the normal course of refinance at other institutions so we only have one transaction there and its a transaction thats a million loan and thats a market that we saw quite a while ago that we felt was extremely overheated so we were very cautious going into that market and were pleased with where we sit today with very very little exposure to that nick lorenzoni q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you for taking my questions gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure thank you operator and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery please go ahead with your question brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc so just a couple maybe gary just one for you on the credit side just in terms of overall trends in criticized and classified levels can you give any just broad characterization of how trends went this quarter just before we see the 10q filing just on kind of how those trends were for the whole portfolio rather than just the specific bucket gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the criticized trends they were up slightly but less than t seven or eight credits in the criticized we got a couple moved in to the substandard i touched on one of them earlier brian those credits basically were from just some slight softer performance were very aggressive in moving those type of credits into a special mention category which was primarily where the movement was and we dont have any concerns with any of those credits that moved into there from a loss fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 perspective longterm customers just a little softer performance and so we built a little bit of reserve against that softer performance we expect that to turn around over the next to months in terms of those particular movements vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and brian i have a tremendous amount of confidence in gary and his team i can tell you as we look at the portfolio gary is on top of the credits his people are on top of the credits the line looks at these credits and they downgrade them if necessary very quickly thats different than what youll find in other companies so youre going to see movements i think its positive because it keeps us well reserved relative to risk so i think as you look over long periods of time and gary has been in the seat for a long time indiscernible years maybe longer right indiscernible im getting old its years and you were there years yeah were all vibrant so weve got a long track record to look at our delinquencies are surprisingly at historical lows the overall quality of the portfolio appears to be good we are focusing on certain segments that we believe globally are soft youd mentioned office thats one area we look at we focus on but thank goodness we have tremendous granularity and a prompt a credit culture that encourages prompt action and i think thats what youre seeing there was a slide we presented i think in the past i dont know if its in the deck with chargeoffs versus reserve build for us we tend to be very early at reserving and then our chargeoffs end up better than the peers so thats a testament to gary and his team getting out early addressing situations early helps you get out of trouble so that youre not experiencing the chargeoffs down the road waiting and not addressing issues creates a shortfall which exacerbates credit problems when youre in a cycle so i dont know i think weve done a great job he wont say that but im going to say it about him brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i appreciate the numbers speak for themselves vince and gary i mean theyre great and even the criticized not being up much is a testimony to kind of the portfolio and the granularity so just trying to stay in front of it if theres things that are coming down the pipe gary you mentioned the stress testing was there anything specific you guys stress tested this quarter that you would call out or just in general that you just continue to stress test the entire portfolio gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania its a general stress test of the entire portfolio on a loan level basis brian so it is a really deep dive every quarter that tom fisher and his team undertakes we review that every quarter updates are made on a monthly basis when necessary so it keeps us forwardlooking from that perspective and i think its a best practice that we put into place that has been very beneficial as we look forward through the economy and what we expect down the road brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 got you okay thanks and then maybe just one or two others so just on the two things on the loan side just maybe just kind of how the pipelines i appreciate the guidance for the year just kind of just trying to get a feel for where the pipelines are today on the commercial side primarily and then i think you mentioned on the mortgage side you were a bit more aggressive on the sales i mean first quarter is typically a seasonally weaker quarter so i guess do you expect to remain aggressive on the sales which could mean that potentially is a bottom for the mortgage revenues as you look throughout the year any difference in strategy there as you go to the balance of the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think the first quarter typically is seasonally slower right because theyre less especially when were focusing on purchase money mortgage loans because there are fewer transactions that occur in the first quarter i would expect that to build through the next two quarters and then come back down again just speaking to the purchase money side with conforming mortgage loans i would expect that to happen there are other origination areas that will produce through that we have physicians loans that we do which are pretty much throughout the year so they kind of offset some of the declines in the later half of the year on the conforming stuff so youll see more jumbo private banking loans coming online which is why we do what we do we want to balance out what goes on the balance sheet and what becomes sale of that our team has done a great job we have terrific people in the mortgage business weve grown it over the last years or so i mean its a big part of our business and a key product for the consumer so it really adds to our ability to obtain clients and i think were going to continue to focus on it and manage it very conservatively but i would expect that to contribute more over the next few quarters i think its fair to say given the seasonality vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i would just add from an income statement standpoint i mean baked into our guidance is the mortgage banking income coming down a little bit from the first quarter level that was going to be a function of how much we do sell right and well continue to manage it like vince said seasonally second and third quarter not quite a big lift in production which is whats baked into our guidance vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then it falls in vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then it kind of falls off vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fourth quarter bellshaped vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 yeah yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but im pretty optimistic i think theyre doing pretty well and were very well entrenched we have great people in that business like i said so i feel good about it vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and the activity is very good first quarter was very good and we expect it to seasonally move up in the second and third as vince said brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania obviously impacted by interest rates brian right i mean that if rates go thats game over well talk about it down the road but i think given the way things are today in a stable interest rate environment for now they should pick up there should be more activity indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah got you and just on the commercial pipeline what youre seeing there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the pipelines theyre up the overall pipeline is up from the last quarter remember we had a big order closing out in december of last year so the fourth quarter last year was pretty solid from a production perspective so pipelines are rebuilding south carolina is at their second highest level historically so theres a lot of activity there raleigh has got a nice pipeline what we call the capital region which is the central part of the state has a tremendous pipeline and weve seen some good activity in some of the rural pennsylvanian markets the folks in state college tony marfisi and his team is doing a terrific job i mean were seeing a lot of activity and good solid middlemarket ci opportunities so i would expect us to continue to build the pipeline as we move through the year and businesses hopefully become more confident in the economy brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and the last one for me and ill step back it was just the it sounds like the dda level youre comfortable that you can maybe sustain this around the current level and then just kind of the outlook on the capital flexibility with kind of reaching a record level of tce and cet1 just kind of your thoughts on capital deployment here if its still just primarily organic growth vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 yeah i would say i mean on the capital front we still like is our cet1 target we think thats the right level just given our risk profile of the balance sheet and also the higher level of capital generation that weve been producing if you look at whats baked into our guidance the capital ratios kind of gradually build from here between now and the end of the year as you saw this quarter we had a nice pickup in the cet1 and tce ratio and we had commented in january that once the indirect sale kind of cleared that would be additive that is like basis points cet1 indiscernible to the tce ratio so we have that and then well kind of gradually build from there and well be opportunistic as we have been in the past and well look to introduce some buybacks we have issuance of stock in the first quarter from normal incentive stuff we could repurchase some of that and look to do some level of activity as we go through the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania given the profitability of the company we have options and were building capital and you go back pretty far so is a pretty nice number for us vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its a solid tce ratio brian martin q
