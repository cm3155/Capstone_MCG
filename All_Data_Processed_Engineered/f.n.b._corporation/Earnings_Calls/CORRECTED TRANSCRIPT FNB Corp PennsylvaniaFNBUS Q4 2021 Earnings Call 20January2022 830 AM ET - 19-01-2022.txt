gary to comment on our overall credit quality gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we ended the year with continued positive performance across all of our portfolios as we closed out another successful year and entered in a position of strength during the quarter we saw further improvement in credit quality as delinquency and npls declined as did our level of rated credit additionally our fourth quarter and fullyear net chargeoffs have both reached historically low levels lets now review some of the highlights followed by a brief update on the upcoming howard bank acquisition and some closing remarks on our outlook for the level of delinquency excluding ppp balances ended december at a very solid basis points an improvement of basis points on a linkedquarter basis npls and oreo also improved during the period to end december at basis points representing a 10basispoint reduction from the prior quarter with reduced non accrual levels of million driving the improvement on a yearoveryear basis our nonaccruals are down nearly compared to december representing an million reduction this largely reflects the actions we took late in to better position our loan portfolio for the year ahead at which time we proactively took risk off the table during a challenging macroeconomic environment net charge offs for the quarter were very low at million or basis points annualized while fullyear net charge offs for totaled million and stood at a solid basis points a historically low level we recognized a million net benefit in the provision during the quarter following the continued improvement in our credit quality position and the prior actions taken in to position the portfolio as well as a general improvement in economic factors that favorably impacted our forecast models this resulted in a gaap reserve position that was down basis points to stand at with the exppp reserve decreasing bps to stand at which remains directionally consistent with our credit reserves our npl coverage position further improved ending december at a very solid level of following the noted reductions in npls and rated credits during the quarter our total ending reserve position inclusive of acquired unamortized discounts stands at id now like to share with you some brief updates around the upcoming howard acquisition our credit teams have been carefully tracking and monitoring the howard portfolio since announcement as is our standard practice at this point we remain pleased with the credit performance and the anticipated day positioning of this book which is tracking better than originally expected postclose we do not expect our loan risk profile or credit quality performance to be impacted as the howard book remains welldiversified and will have minimal impacts to our concentrations of credit as we close out another successful year marked by continued positive credit trends we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio moving into with the global challenges and uncertain economic conditions faced during our proactive approach to risk management and ongoing review of our credit portfolio allowed us to strategically position ourselves entering a proof point of the attentive and disciplined approach we take in managing our credit book we remain vigilant and attentive to any emerging risks in both the broader economy fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and within the markets in which we and our customers operate as macro factors continue to change including economic conditions inflationary pressures and the evolving nature of the virus we will continue to manage our book through this highly competitive environment with our core credit philosophies front and center this foundation of sound and consistent underwriting attentive management of risk and careful selection of high quality lending opportunities continues to support our growth objectives as we look forward to more business opportunities ahead in i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary as we look at our financial results we have delivered an exceptional performance this past year and exceeded our fullyear expectations on both the bottom line and preprovision net revenue basis we produce midsingle digit loan growth excluding ppp was yearoveryear growth on a spot basis we surpassed our fullyear revenue expectations with a record billion driven by continued strategic focus on diversified fee income contribution operating expenses were wellcontrolled and operating preprovision net revenue or ppnr ended the year at million because of our strong credit quality trends and improved economic conditions our provision for loan losses was essentially zero at million for the full year through the successful execution of our strategies we were able to increase our operating net income available to common stockholders by to million or per share lets walk through the fourth quarter financials starting with the highlights on slide fourth quarter operating eps totaled an increase of from the year ago quarter tangible book value per share increased yearoveryear to and excluding ppp which is more reflective of underlying loan growth period end total loans increased million or annualized on a linkedquarter basis including growth of million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans commercial loan production was a record billion diversified across our geographic footprint line of credit utilization increased for the third consecutive quarter to still below the prepandemic level of to consumer lending has the second highest production quarter we also had record linkedquarter growth for small business loans lets continue with the balance sheet on slide average earning assets are now over billion and securities increased linkedquarter due to preinvesting for the upcoming howard acquisition and utilizing excess cash and spot cash balances down reported average loans and leases remained flat at billion with loan growth offset by million reduction in average ppp balances average deposits totaled billion an increase of linkedquarter with yearoveryear growth in all eight of our primary msa markets the growth continues to lead to a favorable funding mix given customers preferences for low cost savings accounts and maintain higher checking account balances we expect organic growth to continue and as rates raise expect a balanced growth in lower beta deposit products to shift to higher beta products turning to slide net interest income totaled million a decrease of million or in the prior quarter total of million reflecting a million decreased contribution from ppp given forgiveness activity which was partially offset by an increase in average earning assets a more favorable funding mix and lower deposit costs reported net interest margin decreased basis points to basis points the total yield on earning assets declined basis points to basis points reflecting the reduced ppp contributions and a million or increase in average cash balances total impact of ppp purchase accounting accretion and higher cash balances on net interest margin was a decrease of basis points for the fourth quarter compared to fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 a benefit of basis points in the prior quarter but excluding these factors net interest margin remains stable reflecting a basis point reduction in the cost of funds offsetting the lower yield on variable rate loans now lets look at noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million while this total decreased million or in the record level last quarter we continue to achieve broad contributions from our feebased businesses capital markets income totaled million solid contribution from swap activity loan syndications debt capital markets and international banking we were very impressed with the performance of our capital markets team with international banking and loan syndications increasing and respectively the recent expansion of our debt capital markets capabilities has tripled revenue in the fourth quarter quickly becoming another 1millionplus revenue business for us service charges increased million reflecting seasonally higher customer activity mortgage banking operations income decreased million or due to a seasonal reduction in heldforsale pipeline and lower secondary market revenue sba volumes and average transaction sizes continued to be strong with million in premium income included in other noninterest income the third consecutive quarter exceeding million reported noninterest expense was wellmanaged and declined million or linkedquarter to million this reduction was driven by salaries and employee benefits declining million or primarily related to higher production performancerelated commissions and incentives in the prior quarter bank shares and franchise taxes decreased million or due to recognition of state tax credits in the fourth quarter of efficiency ratio equals compared to reflecting lower ppp income and the previously mentioned noninterest income decreased from record levels last quarter overall this was a strong quarter close out to positioning us very well for now lets turn to guidance on page we expect the momentum in loan growth to continue we expect loans to increase in the lowdouble digits to lowteens including the benefit of the howard bank acquisition with underlying organic growth in the mid to highsingle digits on a yearoveryear spot basis deposits this year have benefited from the ppp program and other government stimulus which we expect will begin to run off in with that runoff included in our assumptions deposits are projected to grow mid to high single digits on a spot basis inclusive of howard lets now look at the income statement which includes howard bank and all assumptions we expect net interest income to end the year between million and billion with the first quarter between million to million our base guidance currently assumes two rate hikes with the first being in june and the other in september although we have one sensitivity analysis given the recent volatility in the interest rate futures full year noninterest income is expected to be between and million with the first quarter in the high to million range we expect noninterest expense on an operating basis to be between million to million for the full year and million to million for the first quarter given normal seasonality and the addition of howard these do not include the onetime expenses associated with the howard bank acquisition were expected to be better than originally modeled positive credit quality is expected to continue throughout with provision guidance of million to million this does not include the day cecl provision for howard in low million in the first quarter and is dependent on the net loan growth experienced throughout the year lastly the effective tax rate should be between to for the full year with that i will turn the call back to vince fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince has been a great year for fnb with many accomplishments to celebrate id like to summarize several significant achievements fnb achieved record revenue leading to strong earnings with eps at the highest level since the companys restructuring in we grew loans excluding ppp by billion yearoveryear to drive total assets to an all time high of billion generated record fee income of over million or yearoveryear growth which now comprises of total revenue our team achieved more than million in run rate cost savings accomplishing our threeyear total cost savings goal of million strength in credit quality liquidity and the capital position putting our company in a strong position to execute our operating enhanced our digital technologies to better serve our customers putting us at the top of the industry and supported our communities during the pandemic through the facilitation of billion of ppp loan we also continued our effort to provide loans and investments to low and moderate income communities and received an outstanding cra rating through our exceptional financial performance we were able to create value for our shareholders with a year overyear increase to tangible book value and a operating return on tangible common equity in addition our company returned approximately million in capital through dividend and the share repurchase program all of this would not be possible without the dedication of our fnb employees who focus on serving their clients and driving shareholder value every day this past year was a difficult environment to navigate but our employees continuously deliver an exceptional performance as we look to we are well positioned given our continued loan growth momentum investments in differentiated technology asset sensitive balance sheet solid asset quality and improving capital flexibility i look forward to working alongside our employees in driving performance and superior return with that ill turn the call over to the operator for questions fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator very good thank you at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time well pause momentarily to assemble the rooster and the first question comes from michael young with truist securities michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning michael gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey michael vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc i actually wanted to start with more of a strategic question for vince with the rollout of the digital banking both app and online marketplace what will that shift for you all strategically are you going to spend more marketing dollars and try to grab market share there or should we just see more efficient operations in the retail bank how do you kind of think about that maybe both strategically and financially moving forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think it adds it really adds an element to both i think were able to operate more efficiently as we stand up the digital work streams within the company because thats part of it as well i mean the external the customer facing piece of it is important because i think it really helps us scale significantly in markets that have potential where we may not have top market share or deep penetration so having the digital channels were i think since we launched our estore or we basically reformatted it and relaunched it and then added loan products we started last year and then we phased in various loan products so consumer loans came online in august and september and credit card rolled out in january but mortgages were rolled out in the mortgage product itself was rolled out in may weve done pretty well with applications i mean during that period we were able to originate almost applications online for those loan products we havent even started weve done no digital advertising weve done very little with media content or commercials but thats going to gear up so our plan was to build the interface to continuously work to improve it because the next phase of this is to create an omnichannel application ive been talking about it for a long time where fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 customers can go in and fill out one application for five or six products simultaneously thats coming by the end of this year we should have that pretty much in place weve been working on the development of it for some time in the meantime we started standing up the various loan products we had a full suite of depository products that we offered and by the way deposits weve been doing for a long time i mean a couple of years we took applications in the deposit space last year if you look at whats happened if you look at whats going on across the actually i have to restate that we had hits on our website and they werent necessarily applications but people who started to engage with the solution center once we mobile optimized that particular estore product or platform we should call it that jumped so in december for the full month of december we had interactions with the estore not all of them led to applications but they started the process to review the content on products and services what were doing is were grabbing that data those interactions and where we can identify a customer or where theyve identified themselves we can create a lead and then push that back through our retail delivery channel and the commercial bank and have them follow up with it so thats kind of the strategy but its really started to take off and i think its going to add to our ability to grow loans i think it has added i think its helped us this year in certain categories particularly mortgage with 60plus percent of the applications in a year coming through that channel so anyway thats what were excited about and i think it will provide us with a great opportunity to eke out efficiency as we streamline the process to bring these customers on board and work out the digital work streams within the company eliminating a lot of manual processes and then on the flip side it will help us scale and we have not advertised or spent a lot of money promoting it we will this year we have a plan to do that and its included in the expense guide that you got from vince so vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania another element too is the nonbanking business is running their operations through the digital bank too wealth insurance private banking so theres opportunities there to leverage the investments that weve made for really across the businesses michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you and appreciate you tying it back into the financial guide maybe as a followup on the financial guidance for for vince calabrese just as we think about kind of rate hikes youve got two built in to the estimate for the year but if we were to get a third have you kind of looked at the sensitivity on either dollars or nim basis to what an incremental rate hike would be in addition to what you have baked in vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes yeah we did with things moving so quickly weve done some sensitivity analysis around different options so we did quantify that basically the ranges that we have for would go up by about if we get a rate hike in march so adding one march to the june and september that we already have in the guidance is a lift to the range of million and billion fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great really helpful and one last one if i could sneak it in just on howard you guys are so close to closing it are there any kind of pro forma balance sheet actions that you expect to take or things that have already been done whether that would be shrinking it and increasing kind of the nim benefit or anything like that that we should be incorporating as we model that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think as we sit here today michael the main item would be their borrowings of about million and about million or so of wholesale deposits that we would borrowings we would pay off and then the wholesale deposits kind of wean down over the course of the year and then overall thats the main first step and theres nothing else from a like an exit portfolio on the loan side that we have in the past some transactions weve been very happy with credit quality there so its really those just those two items as we sit here today michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay perfect thank you operator thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and thats included in our michael i should comment too thats included in our guide those actions that i just mentioned michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning i wanted to start actually there i guess with a followup on the rate hike question i dont believe you guys provide ph quantify the deposit betas you use but just wondered if you could give any color on how you modeled it out in terms of the first few i would expect very minimal change in deposits pricing and then maybe pickup after there but do you guys straight lined it can you say or do you take that approach vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no its more of a dynamic modeling process i would say i think our expectation as we sit here today would be kind of get a couple of the fed moves in and then start to see some impact on the deposit rates and i guess the way to characterize it i would say by the end of the year maybe or so of the fed move would be captured fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 in the deposit rates and then over time move more towards a kind of historical to but for kind of more in that kind of level frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay and thats what you model in terms of the guidance youve given vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co and then just on the expenses for next year just wondering if you can speak to how significant inflation plays into that and then i may have missed it apologies if i did i know vince spoke of the million in cost saves youve done over the last three years just wondering if there was something similar for this year and if its baked ph into that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of comments there i mean the expenses for  as you know came in consistent with our expectations at million was what we guided to every line item on the noninterest income side as you see is basically unchanged from the third quarter as we move forward into we do have a kind of inflation component baked into our noninterest expense level for the year i mean its in the single kind of mid single digits i would say from a millions of dollars standpoint but that is baked into the guidance that we have and then second part frank what was the second part again frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co cost save the million vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the cost save number we had as you commented million a year for three years weve got a lot of consolidation with the branches over those three years so the bogie we have for this year is million in total for cost save and thats also baked into the guidance and i guess importantly i should say too that when you look at the from an operating leverage standpoint ppp as we know is kind of rolling through and theres a little bit of a tail left in the first half of the year but if you look at the underlying operations of the company and we have positive operating leverage each quarter and expect that to build and if the rate moves come in obviously that gives that even more of a lift but as weve guided to here theres positive operating leverage in each quarter and building throughout the year so i just wanted to comment on that too frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks frank operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared how are you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good how are you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good so loan growth again very impressive third consecutive quarter i think the last time we spoke you guys are very pleased with how december was going i guess given the strong december given the strong production was any of that pulled forward from the first quarter and then i guess as you look out at your guidance the mid to highsingle digit could that prove conservative of the current kind of level of momentum continues or do you see something else occurring in that may kind of bring that loan growth rate down from vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think the guide we gave is fairly consistent if you look back historically in our above trajectory its fairly consistent to where weve grown historically so in our assessment of what the potential is in the marketplace obviously we dont know we rely on pipelines economic data and this input from the field to determine what we think we can produce i would say historically weve been in the mid to uppersingledigit range really skewing towards the uppersingledigit range with everything thats gone on economically with stimulus still the economy is still feeling the effects of stimulus there is potential for us to outperform but we cant we have to rely on what we know today and our pipelines are good we dont really comment on the details of the pipeline but i would say its pretty good across the board particularly in the southeast and in the midatlantic region so we have been doing pretty well down there and its really paid off for us that expansion has helped us the investment in technology sure if that starts to really take off if the adoption picks up we could see some significant growth in certain categories consumer loan categories pick up some growth in small business potentially so that could be additive but our guide i think thats rooted in historical growth for the company and i think its reasonable to apply that guide i also think that you ask about the first quarter i dont know if you meant the first quarter of this year when we were softer and then we had three strong quarters in the second half of the year or do you mean moving into next year this quarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i meant that the fourth quarter production if any of that was pulled forward from the first quarter of vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no no we cant time having been a commercial banker i tell vince calabrese this all the time hes like why cant these people forecast when theyre going to close the deal we dont control when transactions closed there are so many factors obviously the bankers want to get paid and our incentive compensation plans are geared towards they get paid on what they close each quarter so theres a kind of a tug of war between the client and the corporate banker but at the end of the day the client wins and ma transaction gets delayed there are all kinds of things that can happen they decide to defer capex spend into the next year and there goes your incentive comp right you got it you get pushed into march so we dont really control that i dont think anybody theres no reason for people to sandbag in our plans the way theyre structured so i would suspect that the flow of production is real and normal and its not impacted by our people or behaviors of our people timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color and thank you for that and then maybe a question for gary looking at the provision outlook for relative to your comments on asset quality expectations kind of when the howard deal was announced to today could that prove to be conservative as well as maybe some of that day allowances is reversed out throughout the year i guess just maybe talk through the puts and takes of further reserve releases better howard performance and then providing for incremental growth and how that plays through the provision in gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i guess the important pieces there timur are the continuance of the solid performance across the book of business that we manage and we do expect that to continue to track very nicely but also the other important factor is the loan growth that were able to put up that loan growth is really going to drive that provision expense around that guide so depending upon how strong that growth is from that mid to highsingledigit level it could push it up as we move forward referencing howard were very pleased with the performance of that portfolio and the day credit mark and the day provision on that book are going to be better than expected as was mentioned earlier so all told everythings moving in a good direction there its going to be driven by those factors as we work our way through the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you and then one more if i could just looking at the balance sheet it looks like some of the repositioning out of cash and into securities occurred in the back end of the quarter and i think vince you referenced that the margin is a bit spring loaded going into the first quarter of maybe just talk through that dynamic and what was being purchased in the quarter on the securities book and kind of how you expect that to flow through the margin vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 sure yeah the slide references the average cash balance kind of building from to during the fourth quarter on a spot basis it actually came down to billion so we ended the year at billion ph without that excess cash and as we think about whats taken into our guidance that number comes down about half between now and the end of the year is what were projecting as far as the investment portfolio during the fourth quarter we invested a little over million into the portfolio which is about double the portfolio cash flows a good portion of that being preinvesting in anticipation of the howard s acquisition so kind of on a net basis the portfolio grew million during the fourth quarter were investing around million in the third quarter for reference it was million so with basis points higher than what were investing in the third quarter you run that forward to so far this year in the first quarter in january weve invested million we put to work so far in january at million so another basis points higher than where we were in fourth quarter so and at a pretty low duration too ph so as we look to the end of the quarter theres a lot of moving parts with howard coming in were looking to end of the quarter with securities at about billion billion at the end of march from billion to billion as we end the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you i appreciate the color thank you for the questions and nice quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc so just hopefully to close the loop here on the nii guide youve talked about the impact of excess cash and youve talked about the impact of deposit pricing i just was curious on the timing in terms of any floors or anything like that in terms of the incremental benefit of additional hikes as we as we work our way through the year and into next year hows the balance sheet position for kind of the first hike relative to future hikes vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say the floors that we have are really pretty low we have billion of loans that are indexed towards libor indiscernible less than million million or so have floors on them with a current benefit of basis points so basically youd have to fed moves before that ph moves fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 but thats a small portion of the overall portfolio just to remind you that as far as the total portfolio i mean we have billion in total loans at the end of the year tied to onemonth libor and then another billion tied to prime so between the two its of the loan portfolio thats tied to those shortterm indices in the floor levels we didnt have the benefit it on the way down so part of life its not that large of a balance there that kind of have to work back to daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then on the noninterest income side obviously mortgage banking will be impacted by the refi cycle coming to an end here but wondering how you think about the rest of the base of noninterest income and what impact that could have on any of those line items from a rising rate environment vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say as weve talked about in the past the investments weve made over the last couple of strategic planning cycles to invest in these feebased businesses has paid very well for us particularly in an environment when rates came down if you look at the different components i mean service charges just driven by customer activity the wealth management business up yearoveryear trust and securities commission so we look for that to continue to have nice growth this year the insurance business has been growing nicely cap markets while it was down from a ph lights out record of in the third quarter million is a very solid number we will look for that to kind of grow as we go forward and then with additive too is with howard coming on board the depth of the products and services that we have we do not have so we have the opportunity there for their client base to offer a much broader set of products and services including capital markets private banking as well so were very much looking forward to having them as far as a company and working with those customers so its kind of all baked in i mean the interest rate environment we described were baked into our guidance so its kind of all in there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah from a practical perspective we would expect mortgage banking fee income to be down right because margins have come in versus the peak of that cycle but offsetting that on the flip side in a rising rate environment sba gain on sale becomes better that business is starting to pick up for us our debt capital markets platform that vince mentioned that weve launched this past year its already in million in revenue so that will help moving into next year and there are some transactions that will be a part of this year id say next year but i meant there are transactions that were already part of so well get some benefit from the income perspective there syndications the pipeline is still pretty strong in syndications and that business has been moved pretty nicely across the footprint and were now starting to see larger opportunities in the southeast in midatlantic region as well as pittsburgh and cleveland and our traditional markets and then as we look at other opportunities to grow fee income particularly in treasury management with the deployment of products and services and the howard acquisition we feel theres enough other businesses in our diversified model to offset the declines that occur through economic cycle thats kind of how we designed it and were hoping if that holds true for us and well achieve the guidance that were giving here theres a lot of moving parts im sorry vince i just wanted to add indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania quite a bit to make sure that we have that diversification vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and on the mortgage side i would just add that as we look into whats in our guidance for i would expect the fourth quarter well around million probably to see kind of a bottom part of why im saying that is if you look at the expectation in the market for mortgage applications i mean its down to but for us of our business is purchased and the purchase side is actually the expectations from fannie mae at least were up to so that kind of bodes well given the business model that we run on the mortgage side and with us having on the purchase side so i would expect that number all things being equal to kind of build from here as we go through and as thats baked into our guidance too daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color i appreciate all that and thats all i had thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from michael perito with kbw michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but just two quick ones one just on the loan growth obviously over the last few quarters its easy to see the benefit of having the diversified platform but the cre growth has been a little slower sorry if i missed any commentary in this but i was just curious as you look at the kind of the diversity of the pipeline heading into next year any thoughts about where youre expecting to see that mid to highsingle digit core growth come from is the mix going to look similar to the back half of this year or do you think theres room for maybe some other buckets to contribute some more based on the pipeline vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think theres been a lot of activity in cre ive been involved in discussions with some of the borrowers so there are still some projects that were looking at that are fairly sizable and some projects that we closed that fund up over the course of the next year or so so i would expect that business unit to contribute a little more next year but i think overall when we look at our pipeline the carolinas still have very strong pipeline i think charlestons been terrific for us we had good growth in raleigh charlotte theres a building pipeline in charlotte for this year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then the midatlantic region with the howard acquisition positioning the bank well be number six in deposit share and have a pretty substantial lending in that market and in washington dc so im pretty optimistic that well be able to achieve these growth objectives and i said it before i think its really attributable to our expansion strategy and the fact that we were able to secure a substantial market share position and fairly dynamic msas across the southeast and the midatlantic it really helps us so were in a good position as the economy continues hopefully the economy continues to hold together and give us some upside in this year gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey michael one of the things michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania that impacted  a bit there on the cre side we had six multifamily projects as we talked in the past just being kind of lumpy six projects for a million move into the secondary market so that was a bit of a challenge from a footings standpoint in that particular book of business and were going to continue to have that as thats an important part of what we do especially in the southeast as vince mentioned so youll continue to see some lumpiness there with those exits michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful and then just lastly for me obviously its good to see there were some regulatory uncertainty headlines in the markets about deals closing so its good to see howard closing shortly and as expected just curious if you can provide an updated outlook on kind of and where ma is from an appetite perspective and just how you kind of view the market overall and if you think therell be more opportunities or if the pipeline isnt as robust today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well as ive said before were really focused on the best deployment of capital possible so howard kind of met the criteria was in market you take cost out it was a good team it was a decent size it wasnt too big we could easily digest it it really gave us the ability to position the company from an expense perspective moving into an environment where everyones concerned about inflation and wage pressures so it really worked out well the timing of it plus were coming off of ppp so we were able to pick up those balances and the timing also was good with the launch of our estore and the upgrades to our digital offerings so we could offer those consumers those products so i think thats an example of an ma opportunity that we thought was good right when we looked at it we were approved by the fed and the occ i think within days of application so we did not experience delays maybe the relative size of the transaction plus our outstanding rating and that we had just concluded our outstanding cra rating and that we had just concluded some exams that maybe got the regulators a little more fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 comfortable but we were able to do that and im very proud of that i think our relationship with the regulators is strong and we listen and we respond and i think that thats why we were able to get our deal approved and were very conservative in terms of reunderwriting the credits estimating the provision for the reserves in those portfolios and theres a great deal of comfort there having said that i keep telling everybody what im most excited about is the investment that weve made in digital and our digital technology whats going on inside the company that you cant see from automation and ai perspective our data analytics team the data hub that weve created the infrastructure weve built out internally has really been helping us not just with securing customers and gathering information to help our customers with products and services but also to gain efficiency within the company to monitor more and more metrics to help us drive performance so all of thats very very exciting to me and i think given the positioning of the company we did our big expansion and moved into two very dynamic areas of the country which should provide us with significant opportunities for years to come so our focus is going to be on driving market share gains in those markets and if something comes along from an ma perspective that made sense and fits into that strategy sure were going to look at it but it has to be shareholder friendly it cant be something that harms us as shareholders michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so anyway thats it so thank you appreciate your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you appreciate it operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with the da davidson russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys just a followup on the growth commentary curious if you could provide some additional color on what you think needs to happen to hit the high end of the range so to take you from the mid to the highsingledigit is that ci utilization continuing to improve portfolio in single family at the current puts just curious as to what you think the drivers of that delta will be vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think itll be a combination were going to have to execute in all of those areas and i think we grew with very little help from expansion and working capital facilities i know ive read other earnings reports and other companies have seen growth in line utilization we havent really i mean we were up its a de minimis amount that we contributed so while that is a factor i think the more activity you see around working capital utilization that means theres opportunities to finance other things too so that obviously those two go handin hand fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 but we have great opportunities in the middle market across the footprint with the rollout of the estore and now being able to digitally onboard small business customers we have a great opportunity there to do it much more efficiently costeffectively across our footprint so there is upside there there is upside in consumer there is upside in mortgage with our physicians first program that we rolled out that i mentioned so yeah i think weve got a lot of channels to drive that growth so i think russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thats really vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then our pipelines looked pretty solid going into the year so were feeling pretty good russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thats great vince thank you and then just last one for me is a followup on the expense savings you mentioned the million is that from continued branch rationalization or any other drivers there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania just from all the normal vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we have an expense team we call the guy that runs it our real ceo because he is the expense driver so he is the chief expense officer so we have somebody that reports to vince and adam does a terrific job we look at every single line item and then we look at every single large contract that we have wed look at a number of statistics around the branch network and we spend a lot of time theres a whole team of really data analytics people that look at transaction counts and the like and then we also have an effort within our operations area under danny app to review automation and the utilization of intelligent software to help automate and eliminate redundant process and manual process so all of that kind of ties in to the expense reduction and then we also have a team that looks at occupancy expense just constantly i mean theyre constantly reviewing that we dont let any ftes i mean we review every single adds to staff every replacement position at the company and we require people to do an analysis based upon transaction volumes indiscernible ratio to justify even replacement the company has run weve been very fortunate in that given the turnover at many companies our vacancy rate has been within historical norms so weve not seen a mass exodus people leave here and there but its been pretty solid weve not had any trouble recruiting people so i think those are all the things we do to manage expenses so theres a whole process around it and i think weve been weve done a very good job and vince and adam and that team with lou they work for lou have done a terrific job keeping us in line russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 hows the best workplace accolades helped you with the team vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean weve won best workplace for a number of years we just won for the 10th year and one publication in pittsburgh and just about every market the last decade weve won awards and the award the employees feel like theyre part of the process and theres a tremendous amount of engagement we had off the charts engagement scores when we hired a third party to survey the employee base so i think the culture here is very strong its a collaborative culture people genuinely like each other it comes back in the results that we get even though some of us are crazy i think but the rest of the company is pretty they enjoy coming to work and working hard and winning and i think that when you have a culture like that sure youre not impenetrable but its a good place to be anyway thats what leads to our performance and our results all of these things come into play okay russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thank you both for your thoughts there i appreciate it great color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator thank you and the next question comes from samuel varga with stephens inc samuel varga q analyst stephens inc good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i want to ask a couple of questions on the security book quick could you give us the percentage of floating rate securities vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 i have to get that figure although we havent much if any but i can now i can get an answer while were talking if you want to go to your next question samuel varga q analyst stephens inc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania zero here thats zero vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania zero indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania had much of any we dont have any so samuel varga q analyst stephens inc okay and then the kind of followup on that could you give the duration of the available for sale portion of the securities book vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania scott if you want to indiscernible just text me indiscernible have that samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i can ask another question maybe until that number comes up indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 samuel varga q analyst stephens inc okay the duration vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania duration yes on the available for sale samuel varga q analyst stephens inc thank you and then along the lines of kind of market share gains do you have any sort of initiative for hiring whether team left outs or anything like that if you could just tell us about vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean weve hired quite a few people over the last months weve hired we generally hire people from larger institutions in the commercial bank so we just hired somebody from jp morgan here in pittsburgh whos leading the teams in pittsburgh weve hired a number of bankers from other companies in the southeast so good bit of our bankers have come from either at one point in their career they were at either wells or bofa in the southeast the entire charleston team i think at different times we can do a lift out but weve hired a number of people from wells and bbt and other places and i think thats part of our culture too thats why were able to replace positions i think people view our product set as deep if youre a corporate bankers the incentive compensation plans are fair and provide upside and youve got a good solid set of products from debt capital markets all the way across to most of the commercial treasury management products which weve greenwich awards in the treasury management space national award so coming here as a commercial banker youve got it made i mean youre coming and many of these markets we have a high deposit share but a low relative commercial share so the entire market is open to you so if theres anybody out there listening on the call that wants to work here please call me but i think of all the places i have worked ive never worked for a company where the management of the wholesale bank i mean theres such a collaborative spirited culture i cant even describe it i mean other large companies people were fighting within various product areas here the incentive compensation plans are designed to have people work together and they do work together to win they just want to win in the marketplace and do the best they can for their clients and for our shareholders so its a great culture and like i said weve not had an issue bringing people in from any from the largest bank in the united states all the way down so to smaller institutions so anyway samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thank you and then if i could just sneak in a last one do you have any sort of overdraft reduction plans moving forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 we actually were ahead of the curve there we rolled out a product last year there was a press release that was put out you can find it we have a totally we have an electronic checking product that we put out digital part of our digital offering and you cannot overdraft in that again you are not charged with any overdraft fees and thats the third i think it used to be the second most soughtafter product or sold product within the company over the last eight months or nine months it may have dropped a third because our student checking campaign student checking pushes it up but its in the top three of our offering and thats why in our guide on noninterest income it includes a flattening of fees in the consumer segment even though were seeing a rise in other areas so there will be an impact its already been baked into our guidance but thats one thing weve done and weve made a number of other changes and are planning on changing other elements of the fee structure within the consumer bank so vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah were studying the competitive environment vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we cant be a market leader there we have to step back and watch whats happening but we were on that one product and its received very positive reviews and theyve gone certified and its been great vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania also if i could clarify that the duration so the afs duration is at ph the total is so the htm is at so they are pretty similar but just to correct what i said earlier its in the afs portfolio samuel varga q analyst stephens inc thank you very much and thatll be all for me thanks for taking my questions vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys good morning last question here or two just on capital just kind of any changes in your outlook on deployment of capital i know you already talked a little bit about the ma outlook with this share repurchases how youre thinking about that given the flexibility vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure brian cet1 at you can see in the slide deck its been very stable last quarter a year ago so weve talked about a kind of a target there so were pleased with the level there and even with fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 the strong loan growth we had as vince mentioned holding the cet1 flat tells you about the earnings generation that were creating and retaining as we look forward weve baked into our guidance is for the capital ratio to kind of slowly build from here were still swapping normal loans for ppp loans right that have a zero risk weighting so but i still expect given our guidance for the cet1 ratio to build like i said gradually to get from here to the end of the year and then well just be opportunistic on share repurchases i mean our first goal is to deploy it for loan growth so to the extent the loan growth is stronger on the higher end we want to use the capital to support that loan growth but we will be opportunistic on share purchases as we move forward in we didnt do any during the fourth quarter with the timing of howard and regulatory approval and those types of things but well continue to monitor and just manage capital in a way thats fully aligned with shareholder interest but loan growth will be kind of our first lever that we will look to deploy for brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then just baked into the guidance vince i mean what on the maybe you said this and i missed it i joined a little bit late but just the excess liquidity i think if you can just talk about maybe where the core margin is in i guess given and then just the outlook what you have baked in for that a drag of basis points in excess liquidity as you go throughout the year given the loan growth outlook vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so the excess cash for the quarter was billion on average in the fourth quarter so that generated the drag that you see on the slide there as our expectation for is that number kind of comes down in half so it gets to around billion by the end of the year similarly we have ppprelated deposits that are also in our guide that we have projecting to come down about billion or so and those have been stickier than what weve been estimating as weve been going through the process but that is baked into our guidance so basically the cash level will go from an average of billion and then kind of evolve to billion by the end of the year so i cant do that math in my head that quickly i think but thats kind of whats underneath there so that that impact will lessen as we go through the year brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay fine and then just one clarification on the guide the impact of howard and given the timing of the close i mean the impact to nii and not nii but just the fees and expenses and whatnot that assumes the close here next week or was that baked in at yearend close just want to make sure i clarified what youve got here on the on the guidance vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no its in there for months so indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah i got you okay thats what i thought i just want to make just want to clarify thanks vince i appreciate you taking the questions fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings
