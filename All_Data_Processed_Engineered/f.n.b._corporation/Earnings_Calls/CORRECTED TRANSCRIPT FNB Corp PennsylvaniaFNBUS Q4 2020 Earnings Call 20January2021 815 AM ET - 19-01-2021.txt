target in when including a plan to reduce an additional million in expenses during full year in total this amounts to more than million of expense reduction over the threeyear period because of our proactive expense management initiative our efficiency ratio remained at a good level at despite pressures on net interest income in a challenging rate environment and continued capital investment in technology our strategy is proven through varying cycles as evidenced by the solid performance and continued focus on improvement in many key asset quality metrics to expand on this topic ill ask gary to comment on credit quality gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone our credit portfolio continued to perform in a satisfactory manner in the fourth quarter and we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio as we move into our key credit metrics showed improvement across a number of categories after we took steps during the quarter to proactively reduce exposure to borrowers most impacted in this covidsensitive environment which drove a reduction in the level of delinquency and npls specifically we were successful in further reducing our limited exposure to the hotel and lodging industry by nearly which improved our position in this hardest hit asset class that now stands at only of the loan portfolio exclusive of ppp loan balances lets now review some of the highlights covering both the fourth quarter and fullyear results followed by some commentary around covidsensitive portfolios and deferrals turning first to credit quality the level of delinquency came in at a very good level of representing a 5basis point improvement over the prior quarter and when excluding ppp loan volume delinquency would have ended december at the level of npls and oreo totaled basis points an improvement of bps linkedquarter while the non gaap level excluding ppp loans stood at basis points we saw very positive oreo sales activity this quarter which contributed to the million linkedquarter reduction for an ending oreo balance of million a historically low level additionally we were successful in moving several credits off the books during  to proactively derisk the balance sheet thereby further reducing npl levels net chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points annualized which reflects the actions taken to strategically move the select covidsensitive credits off the books utilizing previously established reserves our gaap net chargeoffs for the full year came in at a very solid basis points provision expense totaled million for the quarter ending december with a reserve position at excluding ppp loan volume the nongaap acl stands at or a 5basis point linkedquarter decrease again due to the reductions in exposure across these covidimpacted sectors when including the remaining acquired unamortized discount our total coverage stands at the npl reserve coverage position also remains favorable at reflecting a slight improvement linkedquarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 id now like to provide you with an update on our loan deferral levels and covidsensitive industry exposure as it relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral of the loan portfolio excluding ppp was under a covidrelated deferral plan at december as i mentioned earlier we made significant progress during the quarter to further reduce the limited exposure we have to higherrisk segments including travel and leisure food services and energy on a linkedquarter basis exposure to higher risk segments declined by nearly million to stand at only of the total loan portfolio a primary driver of the decrease was led by a million reduction in hotel exposure which as noted earlier in my remarks stands at only of our total loan portfolio loan deferrals in the three higherrisk segments ended the year at only down from the prior deferral level of at the end of the third quarter in closing we are very pleased with the progress made during the final quarter of the year in this covidsensitive environment with our credit metrics ending at very satisfactory levels as we entered very wellpositioned we continue to closely monitor our book and remain focused on managing risk in our covidimpacted sectors as we work to further reduce portfolio exposure to these higherrisk industries that continue to face uncertainty in the current environment as we move into a new year we look forward to an improving economy and the expanded lending opportunities ahead i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will discuss our financial results and discuss some of our current expectations as noted on slide fourth quarter operating eps totaled an increase of compared to the third quarter fullyear operating eps totaled after adjusting for million of significant items while this year brought unique economic challenges we were wellpositioned to adapt to the environment and provide strong internal capital generation vince mentioned we increased our tangible book value per share to an increase of in despite a volatile year for equity markets our combined dividend yield and share repurchases put us above peer median level looking at we are confident that returning to generating core positive operating leverage on a quarterly basis will lead to better overall performance compared to lets review the fourth quarter starting with the balance sheet on page average balances for total loans decreased in the third quarter largely due to the previously mentioned indirect auto sale of million which was completed in november linkedquarter ppp balances decreased million on a spot basis as we received forgiveness for maintenances from the sba throughout december commercial loans line utilization rate are which is about or billion in funded balances below what we would characterize as a normal level creating upside for loan growth as the economy improves turning to deposits average deposits grew with growth in interestbearing deposits and growth in noninterestbearing deposits partially offset by an decrease in time deposits this continued total deposit growth provided ample liquidity and affords us the opportunity to pay down an additional million in fhlb borrowings with a rate of during the fourth quarter excluding fhlb debt extinguishment from the third quarter a total of million in borrowings were terminated during the year with expense savings that will fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 continue through as vince noted fnb is in a very strong position to fund future loan growth strengthen capital and enhance liquidity turning to the income statement net interest income increased million or compared to the third quarter the net interest margin increased basis points to ppp loans added basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter as the level of net interest income from ppp increased million compared to third quarter offsetting basis points of negative impact from higher average cash balances and basis points of lower purchase accounting benefit on acquired loans interestbearing deposit costs improved basis points to basis points and on a spot basis were down another basis points to basis points lets now look at noninterest income and expense on slides and operating noninterest income totaled million when excluding the million loss on fhlb debt extinguishment mortgage banking income remains strong at million with large contributions from the midatlantic and pittsburgh regions and the results benefited from above average gainonsale margins compared to historical levels for the fullyear of mortgage banking increased reaching a record million wealth management increased from the third quarter due to the expanded footprint and positive market impacts on assets under management capital markets wealth management mortgage banking and insurance are businesses weve strategically invested in over the last five years providing diversified revenue streams that have served us well in this low interest rate environment in the aggregate revenue from these businesses increased million or to million for the full year of looking on slide noninterest expense totaled million an increase of million or which included million of branch consolidation expenses and million of covid19 related expenses in the fourth quarter of compared to million of covid19 expenses in the third quarter excluding these covid19 and branch consolidation expenses noninterest expense increased million or primarily driven by higher productionrelated commissions and incentives as well as million in outside services ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased basis points to compared to september with net ppp loan balances negatively impacting december and september tc ratios by basis points and basis points respectively compared to the yearago quarter the ratio decreased basis points due primarily to the ppp loan impact and the day cecl adoption impact on a linkedquarter basis our cet1 ratio improved to an estimated reflecting fnbs strategy to optimize capital deployment increased over basis points from yearend to turning to our outlook we will offer quarterly guidance for the first quarter of and some highlevel expectations for the fullyear of ill note that our assumptions do not take into account the impact of recently announced stimulus programs for the first quarter we expect periodend loans to decline lowsingle digits relative to december assuming approximately million of additional forgiveness of ppp loans in the first quarter excluding ppp and purchase accounting we expect first quarter net interest income to be at a similar level compared to the fourth quarter we expect continued solid contributions from feebased businesses with continued strength in capital markets and mortgage banking resulting in total noninterest income in the mid to high million range we expect expenses to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter operating level for the full year of on a fullyear basis we expect total revenues to decline lowsingle digits as top line organic growth is offset by reduced contributions from purchase accounting compared to we would expect fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 loans to grow in the midsingle digits from the end of excluding impact of ppp forgiveness in that of any new ppp originations ill note this does not account for any additional government stimulus and assume some level of line of credit utilization increase throughout the year as the us economic conditions are expected to improve from where we stand today we would expect transaction deposits excluding ppp and stimulus to increase midsingle digits from yearend we expect fullyear provision for credit losses to be in the million to million range based on our current macroeconomic assumptions we expect fullyear expenses to be down slightly from the million operating level in as we execute on our expense savings target of million while continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure in lastly we expect the effective tax rate to be around assuming no change to the statutory corporate tax rate of i will now turn the call back to vince vincent j delie

rollout of the vaccine take hold accelerating business activity and economic growth as we move through the year we will continue to serve our constituencies by actively engaging with communities investing in our dedicated employees and working continuously to deliver greater shareholder value operator fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 question and answer section operator yes thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and the first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just wanted to ask first to stick on buybacks so you bought back some shares in the fourth quarter i just wondered how you would characterize the buyback opportunity here with shares having recovered to higher levels and then also your thoughts on i believe you kind of thought youd get to an tce ratio ex ppp over the next few quarters i wondered if theres any change to that as well vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure frank i could comment on that just from a capital perspective as you saw in the slides we ended the year with the cet1 ratio at and our tce ratio of excluding ppp both good levels and as you mentioned we did comment and we expect to move past and for half of as you know weve taken actions to bolster our capital position to take it to these levels that are really highest for us within our kind of forecasts and guidance to look for capital ratios to kind of gradually build from here and then as far as the repurchase activity i mean weve done nearly out of the programs that was authorized in the fourth quarter were going to continue to be opportunistic we think the valuation is still very attractive at these levels what we did buy back was reflective of the confidence and the strength of the balance sheet overall credit profile that we had during the fourth quarter were able to buy back of those below tangible book value which is nice from accretion to that measure so i mean were going to be opportunistic its going to be a function of loan growth and see how loan growth goes if loan growth slows then theres more opportunities to do that but its definitely going to be a tool we have and well look to deploy as we go through the year frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 got you okay and then just secondly on the expense side of things million in expense savings targeted for you guys have done a nice job paring expenses over the past few years and so million is sort of like par for the course actually for you guys and i wondered if maybe there is more opportunity given the tough well given the tough rate environment but also the acceleration in the digital channel to maybe see further cost saves in or would any further saves likely just be reinvested thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey frank this is vince hey it becomes more difficult when you look at it in aggregate its million over three years and i think weve done a pretty good job despite the headwinds with margin cutting cost each year so we have a process that weve actually set up inside the company to continuously look for cost save opportunities so i wouldnt rule out that we could do additional i would say we keep looking the timing of that cycle puts us pretty much million a year and thats what we initially set out to do over a multiyear period and were well down the path of accomplishing that thats why weve included it in our expense guide for the year but theres always an opportunity to look at a number of areas within the company to drive additional efficiency i think as we look at this year weve pared back our branch network fairly significantly that was the comment in my prepared comments i mentioned branches we continue to look for opportunities to pare back where we feel we have the ability to retain customers i think the move with the atm distribution enhancing our atm delivery channel particularly in the midatlantic and in the ohio market in the last months this will help us leverage our digital channels to attract new customers which gives us the ability to weed out lowerperforming branches right and not lose the coverage of the marketplace thats the overarching strategy but i would say that we continue to focus on it obviously wed love to see our efficiency ratio below thats always been our target was to be around hopefully in the long run and some of that comes with revenue growth too and the final half of this i was going to tell you that we feel very confident about the markets that weve entered were seeing good success in those higher growth markets so hopefully our growth trajectory starts to improve as the economy improves and we start to see outsized revenue growth contributions from those markets which will obviously help the efficiency ratio were not just focused on expense were focused on driving top line revenue frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies got it and then sorry just quickly just want to make sure i heard vince calabrese right on the ppp did you say that was added basis points total to and if so just could you remind us what contribution was vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the fourth quarter was yeah basis points to the fourth and basis points to the third quarter was the contribution fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies thank you okay thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure operator thank you and the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys wanted to touch on the loan growth the guide midsingle digits just can you just give us some color on it sounds like its im assuming its going to come from your highergrowth markets but on a product basis cre was pretty strong and weve seen others show cre momentum as well just given the concerns there whats driving that strength and then also vince calabrese you mentioned line of credit utilization is backstopping some of this and im just trying to square that with whats obviously very flush liquidity situation among borrowers so just some little more color on the loan growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the southeastern markets in particular and the midatlantic region they have fairly substantial pipelines the overall pipeline is down slightly i think vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania to gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania to vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania on a yearoveryear basis but the quality of the pipeline i think is better and we spent more time sorting out where real opportunities are and i would also say that the pipelines in the southeastern markets are fairly robust i mean charleston is doing exceptionally well we expanded in asheville north carolina were seeing some good activity in asheville both from a cre and ci perspective the midatlantic regions still moving in the right direction had some growth potential then our legacy markets were expecting to pick up in the second half of the year theyre more industrialbased in the midwest and were expecting to see more ci opportunities gary i dont know if you want to add to that youre seeing the book fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania youre seeing the opportunities come over gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think as you mentioned vince the southeast has been more active than the other regions at this point seeing some new opportunities we brought on a few new bankers and theyve been active so were seeing some very nice new opportunities with some new names out of those new bankers that weve brought on who are very very solid and experienced bankers in those markets in terms of the line of credit utilization casey we did see it bottom in the fourth quarter it actually moved up about a into the mid32 range so we are expecting as the economy improves over the next year that in the latter half we will see some growth from a utilization standpoint with our industrial base so thats kind of the expectation there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah keep in mind theres a lot of cash on corporate balance sheets sitting on the sidelines so were going to have to go through several sales cycles to deplete that cash some of its stimulus driven so theres id say the second half of the year is when youll start to see expansion on the revolvers from a balance perspective casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and appreciate the color on the ppp and the purchase accounting is there a way to quantify what the contribution will be in for those items so we can get a better sense of what the core revenue outlook looks like vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah let me go through some of pieces because theres a lot of moving parts in there so for the fourth quarter net interest income was million right ppp contribution was million up from million in the third quarter so reflects that forgiveness of just about million that we had and kind of updates our assumptions for the remaining life so the purchase credit deteriorated accretion that was related to cecl was million down million from the third quarter okay so from million so kind of all in if you look at net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting were at million which is up slightly from million so just kind of underneath this activity fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 the nim the other item that we had also is just cash position right so the cash position will reduce the margin by about basis points so all of these kind of contribute to our good confidence that were in an inflection point for the kind of underlying nim when you look ahead to the first quarter we think the net interest income excluding again ppp and purchase accounting will be relatively stable even with the couple fewer days that you have in the quarter the ppp contribution we expect to be million to million assuming million of forgiveness and then purchase accounting probably comes down another couple million to million or so so those are kind of the key moving parts as far as the purchase accounting and ppp and then just a couple of other kind of key drivers just for everybody for me to touch on so interestbearing deposit costs we mentioned in the slide it came down basis points to basis points we ended the quarter on a spot basis at basis points so that kind of gives us a basis point head start to the first quarter and theres still some more opportunity there on the business deposit side the consumer cds continue to roll down we have maturities of million to million a month in the first quarter those are kind of coming off at around to new cds are coming on at basis points so that continues to create opportunity on the rate paid side and then the new loans that we made during the quarter from a pure kind of coupon standpoint came on at which is a basis points higher than the portfolio yield so that stabilization obviously helps on the loan side and then lastly the reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio were basis points during the quarter excluding some key growth that we had for pledging purposes so now that starts rolling off at so theres a little bit of a headwind there but i think loan yield stabilizing and new loans in relation to the portfolio helps as well as the continued opportunity on the deposit side so sorry for the long answer but i wanted to kind of go through all those key drivers casey haire q analyst jefferies llc no no no thats great very helpful appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay to make it even complicated casey we originated in the first day cpt applications through roughly million and it just started we just launched our portal so were in day now so we will be adding footings vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and thats not in our guidance vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats not in the guide vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood understood vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that will be coming off the balance sheet casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and just last one for me a question for gary so the million to million provision obviously you guys have your cecl forecast and im just wondering what the loss progression looks like for and where the acl ratio lands at the end of the year with that kind of provision guide vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania gary gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania casey weve done a lot of work across the portfolio reviewed a lot of credit updated a significant amount of credit in the latter half of the year with our normal reviews that come then flush what weve done on top of that with the three deepdives around the covidimpacted portfolios and one of the things that we did as we mentioned we took some actions in the fourth quarter to reduce our exposure to what we call the higherrisk assets in those covidimpacted sectors and we really feel good about the books coming into the new year our reserve levels at yearend were at solid levels our chargeoffs for the full year came in at basis points and we feel really good about the work weve done and the position of the book so our expectations as we look forward subject to loan growth around the portfolio is that were expecting chargeoffs to be in what we would call normal ranges with some guide there and we feel good about that provision guide in we have expectations that the economy will continue to improve so a lot of work has gone into it and we feel good about the information that we have forward with you casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks casey vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks casey operator thank you and your next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just sticking with the credit discussion when you look at the guide for that million to million of allowances and what we saw this quarter how much of a qualitative overlay did you have to utilize to sort of keep the provision where it was and as to your comment about an improving expectation for the economy should we assume that that qualitative overlay declines over the year and that we really do see some significant reduction in that allowance ratio gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we with the end of the year review of the acl we did utilize some qualitative overlay based on the position of the book that said the majority of our acl is quantitative but there is a qualitative overlay as the economy improves well continue to manage that appropriately the metrics that we utilize there jared with an improving economy coming into play in  also improvement in unemployment housing gdp as well as the markets so generally were looking at a gradual steady improvement unemployment will continue to decline and its just over in our forecast horizon and gdp growths about next year and in the year after so i mean those are some of the inputs into our acl that i can give you and we feel good about the position of it at this point jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 okay and then on the ppp with this second round i know its excluded from your guidance but looking at the billion you were able to put on in the first round in that that went on pretty quickly where you see the second round peaking and when do you think we get there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think its too early to tell i dont feel that i mean i can tell you were running were at about of the total that was originated last time and there was just a mad rush so i dont see that happening i think that well continue to originate as i said were at million roughly with applications is what we took when we cut it off last night so and the portal had just opened so i would expect there to be sustained demand for the product and i think its hard to say but we wont hit we wont be at to billion i can tell you that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc with that growth is that your loan officers being proactive and going out and letting your customers know that the portals there or is it that theres sort of this organic demand for it that that you know people sought it out vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well we yeah weve been in communication when we originated in the first round we captured everybodys email addresses and pertinent contact information they were assigned to a banker physically every single one of those or loans was assigned to a banker of the company and those bankers have maintained communication and weve also set up a communication system via email where we update the clients periodically about whats happening with the sba and the ppp program so i would say we were pretty active with that base that we originated the first time and what were seeing are folks that are coming back that feel that they qualify for this tranche and theyre coming back and so i would say yes its been managed and its been very fluid for us we developed our portal inhouse our people did a fantastic job planning it we monitor the changes that ph were going on which were constant with the sba its very complicated because theres a first draw second draw and we still have forgiveness going on but weve automated all of those processes and when we went live the website worked flawlessly for us so and were endtoend digital so im very impressed with what our people have done and very pleased with how easy this is to use for the customers jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks and then just finally for me on the expense side thats great with the million target i guess when we look at the covid accommodations whether thats expenses or waived fees should we expect that that is over now in or whats the tail on those covidsensitive expenses and covidsensitive missing fees and do you think that we get a efficiency ratio back to where we were in vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 i would say that the just couple things i mean on the expense side we still have some level of supplies indiscernible maybe its million to million just looking ahead to the first quarter at least so therell still be some level of that just kind of given where we are if you look at the fee income side you could see that on that noninterest income slide that service charges were down about yearoveryear at the bottom it was down about so weve definitely seen customer activity kind of move back up not back to prepandemic levels yet but i guess well see as you go into i think one of the key things that were monitoring as everybody else is is how customer behavior changes and evolves over time weve done i think a great job of investing in all the digital initiatives ph like the atm and the clicks to bricks that we have so that customers can bank wherever they want to bank but were definitely going to closely monitor the customer behavior over time to see if there are opportunities for maybe more consolidation as you go forward from here and i guess theres one other thing on expenses too i wanted to mention is were process improvement initiatives weve been actively working on that over the last few years and definitely looking at using some of these robotics the rpa initiatives to streamline processes even more so we have a good number of initiatives this year that will help the efficiency ratio and some of thats baked into the guidance if we can do even better on that itd be the first time were implementing some of these techniques i think theres more opportunity there too vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and weve invested pretty heavily in the digital realm and that includes data analytics data warehousing the interface were adding features to our website where today you can purchase checking account products and move through the whole process online digitally from endtoend were adding loan products this year our mobile app is going to have a picture bill pay enhanced chat credit score estatements a new user interface and the ability to immediately enroll in mobile through the mobile application were also taking the mobile optimized website with a solution center and thats going to be incorporated into our mobile app so people can actually shop on the solutions that are within the mobile app without going into a disparate website so theres a lot going on i dont think we should lose focus on investing in those areas because thats whats kept us competitive with larger competitors and fintechs and i think were hanging in there you can see from the market share data that i shared with you that weve done well in just about every msa were in in terms of growth so i dont think that battles over i know were dealing with headwinds on margin so weve kind of curtailed some of it or delayed some of that investment but thats still needs to be a focus jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks jared operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with truist securities michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey michael vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc wanted to maybe do a quick followup on the expense side so youve got about million of kind of core expense inflation million of planned savings and i would assume thered be maybe a little bit of tailwind from lower costs in the fee businesses on a yearoveryear basis and in particular mortgage so maybe could you kind of square that comment with maybe your expectations for the mortgage outlook or other fee businesses that maybe that are going to do better in vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean the fee business has had a phenomenal year in with record levels as vince commented in his remarks when we look at mortgage plus capital markets plus insurance plus wealth the million increase there in fee contribution as we said in our guide the contributions there we would continue to have at very strong levels i dont know that were going to set a record every quarter as we did with mortgage when you look at mortgage last quarter but this quarter was very strong again million following an million so weve invested a lot in those businesses weve expanded geographically particularly in the mortgage business we think theres still more upside to come with some of the markets and folks that have joined the team over the last year but i think as we come through this period that will continue to bring more benefits to us on the expense side i would say that the guide overall is kind of down slightly from levels and the first quarter always has theres payroll taxes and things kind of jump up in the first quarter but if you look at the expenses going out second third and fourth quarters you get right around that 178ish million that we have been guiding to which hence the kind of the flat guide thats in there and thats through the cost savings the million cost saves as well as kind of other initiatives to improve the efficiency so thats kind of where you get to once you get through kind of the first quarter seasonal increase there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 michael young q analyst truist securities inc and i guess my second question kind of is to go back to the zero interest rate environment that we had coming out of the last cycle i remember at that point in time you guys felt like it was prudent to grow more quickly early in the cycle while credit spreads were wider as those would only get competed away throughout the cycle so maybe just kind of an update on your view on being more aggressive on loan growth early this cycle again and when youd feel comfortable kind of stepping out there and being more aggressive in that way vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania our strategy has always been to be consistent through cycles so while we were able to grow faster and gain better margins because of credit spreads broadening through the depth of the cycle we were out in the marketplace deploying capital throughout the financial crisis that hasnt changed whats changed here is the trillions of stimulus thats been injected into the economy so i think if we didnt have that my belief is that fnbs credit metrics would be superior we would be out in the marketplace originating while others would be retrenching or returning capital because of concerns that didnt happen this cycle because i attribute it to the stimulus its essentially providing an opportunity for companies to work through the issues without relying on a bank to provide additional capital essentially were providing the capital but its federally guaranteed for ppp and even in the consumer segment with these stimulus checks which are unprecedented that has changed the game so with that we have to be very careful about what we originate because eventually there will be a day of reckoning so i would say were optimistic about the areas that we focus on and were continuing to deploy capital in those areas just as we have in the most robust times and i think we will get a benefit because i think given the zero rate environment borrowers have been more receptive to floors when we think about their allin rate an additional basis points doesnt change much its not even that youve got to net out the libor one month libor rate so i think that well our loan originations in the commercial segment were still calling aggressively that will turn at some point here when demand starts to pick up and what we believe in the second third and fourth quarter this year sorry for the long answer but thats the view michael young q analyst truist securities inc no that makes sense and one just quick last maybe for vince c are there any other balance sheet actions that can be taken or opportunities ahead youve taken some in the last two quarters so just curious if theres anything else out there that we should expect vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say that were always analyzing the full balance sheet to see if theres ways to improve the position we took a lot of action in and i would say as we sit here today if you look at the home loan advances theres about billion or so million matures in so kind of a short life there so theres another billion or so that well continue to evaluate to see does it make sense to potentially do that but we dont have any plans to do it right now michael i mean its just kind of part of our regular evaluation and fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 assessment of the markets and the balance sheet but as we sit here today we dont have any plans for any other actions michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure operator thank you and the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey gary just wanted to ask was any of the reduction in the higher risk portfolios like the hotel due to loan sales or was that paydowns of maybe some weaker credits that you didnt want to retain gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we moved million in hotels million of the million we moved them in the normal course of business moving them off the balance sheet we did sell a handful of hotels that we classified as higher risk in that book so it was only million and we did move some other small business related items of a similar dollar amount but other than that the majority of that was just moved off of the balance sheet brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay of that million that you sold was there any chargeoffs that were tied to those sales gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the total amount that we moved including some of the small business stuff was right at million brody and in terms of chargeoffs the chargeoffs on that book were million and of that we had that totally reserved for going into the sale so it was provisionneutral so it was a very good indiscernible brody preston q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 okay and im sorry if i missed this bit could you give us a sense for how criticized and classified loans trended this quarter gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the classifieds were down million and the criticized were up just a touch over million criticized being special mention so we had good movement in classifieds slight increase in the special mention category brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay all right maybe just turning to new loan originations appreciate the color on the pipeline but just wanted to get a sense vince for what new ci and new cre yields are like today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania were getting i mean vince can maybe give you more detail but on originations i can answer that were running in the probably range right spread gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the spread is up about to bps over midyear so we are seeing improvement from a spread perspective vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and as i said earlier i think the floors move down a little bit right we were seeing bps now were seeing bps so theres a little bit of competition theres a lot of competition out there but in particular in focusing on the floors were still able to get them not at the same spread that we wouldve gotten at the beginning of the crisis brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right is that spread over libor or i guess whats the benchmark vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania garys talking spread over libor gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania im talking floor fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay right understood and then the liquidity ticked up again which you deployed some of that in the securities is that a strategy we should expect more of or would you rather sort of hold off and use that to fund loans moving forward vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania oh itll be a combination were monitoring that every day to decide kind of which way to go we have been letting the securities portfolio run down earlier in the year and we did put some good portion of the cash flows that came out of that portfolio we reinvested in the fourth quarter and kind of the plan right now would be to hold securities flat in but again thats subject to change as kind of rates move around liquidity is there weve used some of the assets to pay down some of the borrowings as we said well continue to evaluate that and then additional stimulus is just going to bring more deposits into all the banks right so i think that the plan there would be as vince commented earlier as you get through the year and you get the vaccine behind and hope that economic activity picks up and the customers work through cash and then they start to borrow again to utilize that liquidity so wed like having the powder and i think our teams are very well positioned theyre actively calling on their clients as well as prospects so that when that time comes i think well be right at the table brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and what are new security yields right now vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania theyre around i want to say around basis points really pretty low brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay okay and then just i wanted to ask the outlook for capital markets are you expecting some of your middle market customers to get more active throughout the year or is there not as much of a need just with so much liquidity on balance sheets right now vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i think that therell be opportunities for us to continue to execute in capital markets realm as we move through the year particularly in the second half of the year i think that therell be more activity and our borrowers will want to take advantage of the low rate environment so it will lead to opportunities as we start to fund debt from a working capital perspective were not fixing tranches of embedded working capital were focusing principally on term borrowings so that doesnt really come into play frequently but from a cre perspective thats still an active area i would expect us to continue to see decent level of capital markets opportunities and our syndications areas both cre and ci are reloading their pipelines so i think ma will pick up in the second half of the year again and were also forming a were in the final stage of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 completing the formation of a brokerdealer to take advantage of debt capital markets fees for our large corporate borrowers thats a move that we made so that should help us as well this year that will be finalized shortly and well be able to accept these debt offerings for our clients as we have done at this point yeah brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay thank you for that just a couple quick ones left on your insurance business just wanted to ask how much of that is related to individual policies or is there a commercial insurance component to that as well vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its pretty small the individual piece of it is relatively small its mostly commercial its employee benefits and your typical riskbased policies for commercial brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and then just on the expense outlook appreciate the guidance but youre on in this a little bit higher than where your guidance would imply right now so i just wanted to get a sense for if you could walk us through i guess maybe some of the timing as to when the expense that core expense number would run down and get you closer to a sub720 million level for the full year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say just couple points i mean the fourth quarter expenses are a little bit higher as we commented on kind of productionrelated commissions and incentives are in there we typically have some of that at the end of the year kind of true everything up based on how do you close out the year so thats in there theres a couple milliondollar increase in outside services professional fees related to a variety of projects that we have going on where we brought in some outsiders to help with things like libor and a whole list of projects that we had proposed kind of helping out with so thats really not kind of run rate as you go forward theres a couple million dollars in there for that our fas fasb deferred origination fees were about million lower so that increased the expenses so theres a lot of moving parts to kind of the fourth quarter which is why my comment just a little earlier ago was if you look at the expense run rate kind of second through fourth quarter once you get through the seasonal blip were right around the million that we ended talking about for a couple of quarters in there so the million initiative is a lot of i mean its all identified and a lot of its in place most of it starts within the first few months i would say so that you get that kind of run rate benefit but the million is inclusive of the various timing of those initiatives as we go through the year but most of its pretty early as we would expect so that we get most of the fullyear benefit of those expense savings brody preston q analyst stephens inc great thank you very much for taking all my questions everyone i appreciate the time fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure no problem vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys good morning most of my stuffs been answered just a couple things could you guys just comment i mean in the past you guys have been pretty adamant about ma was off the table but with activity maybe picking up this year just if you could give any thoughts on how youre thinking about it if its still really the focus continues to be organic growth or is there some consideration you could be opportunistic on ma this year if activity does pick up vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would definitely say that while were experiencing good success with our de novo expansion and the rollout of our digital platform more globally i think theres opportunities i mean were going to do whatever makes sense for our shareholders if there are opportunistic transactions well look at them i think that one thing for sure though is that were going to look for something that doesnt compare tangible book value substantially so the earnback would have to be relatively short and as from our past ma activity our board is adamant about eps secretion significant internal rates of return some capital invested and earnback so those will be key elements and i do think as we moved through weve made significant investments in our platform in our systems in our infrastructure assets which i think will be daunting for smaller banks so i do think there will be opportunities to take cost out and to merge with or acquire smaller organizations that provide some decent accretion in some instances may be accretive to tangible book value and capital so thats where we are thank you for asking the question brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah and just the in your thought vince would this be probably inmarket deals i guess is what it sounds like rather than entrants into new markets the way you look at it today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say theres still work to do within the franchise were spread across pretty broad geographies so theres plenty of opportunities to do inmarket acquisitions and that would be the priority but obviously we can take significant amount of cost out with overlap weve been the shrinking branch delivery channel with the rollout of more digital capabilities fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 so i think that coupled with our ability to roll out additional atm sides across our footprint kind of bridging the gap were out to with branded and owned atms so we have a pretty substantial network that goes hand inhand with our ability to originate customers both digitally and through the physical delivery channels so obviously within that footprint is much easier to do brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then just the last two for me i guess the other vince vince appreciate the color on the ppp did you give what the remaining unearned fees to collect are at this point before the new program kicked in here just kind of whats left as we go through the balance of the year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian i have that its at the end of the year we are million of remaining unaccreted fees you may recall it was kind of million to start with the program and theres million thats left to come in that we would expect to virtually all of it to come in during kind of depending on the pace of forgiveness brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then last one for gary was just the color on the criticized and classified level i mean gary do you feel like and then i guess it sounds like from your outlook i guess would you anticipate that fourth quarter levels are maybe a peek in the criticized and classified levels based on kind of review of the portfolio and the better macroeconomic outlook is that kind of how youre thinking about it today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say thats an accurate view at this point brian naturally the economy is going to play a role there if we get a continuing improvement throughout the year from here yeah i would expect that to play out naturally youre going to have a credit or two move from a rating standpoint so thats going to temporarily move the number but i think we are at an inflection point there brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then that utilization you talked about kind of trending back up maybe in the back half of the year i guess can you get back to precovid levels or do you just think its going to get maybe partway back if things kind of unfold as you guys look at them today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think its going to be a slow grind forward with increased activity in the latter half i would not expect it to get back to a normal level by yearend brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thanks for taking the question guys fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania brian thanks operator thank you as that was the last question i would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you i really appreciate the interest and the questions i thought they were great questions hopefully we were able to provide transparent answers so you guys
