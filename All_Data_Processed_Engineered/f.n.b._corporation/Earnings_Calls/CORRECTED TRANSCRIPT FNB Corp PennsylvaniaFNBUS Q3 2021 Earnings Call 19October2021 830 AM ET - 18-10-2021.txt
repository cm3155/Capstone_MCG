eps to our performance across our core businesses led to record revenue this quarter of million up on an on a linkedquarter annualized basis with strong underlying momentum visible on our loan growth pipeline fee income and digital customer engagement lets look at each one of these core building blocks starting with loan growth our spot loan growth excluding the impact of ppp forgiveness is annualized linkedquarter driven by a strong pickup in lending activity in both the commercial and consumer portfolios spot commercial loan growth totaled annualized on a linkedquarter basis with positive growth in nearly every region across our footprint notably the pittsburgh cleveland harrisburg and raleigh region consumer lending grew over annualized linkedquarter led by increases in residential mortgages and direct installment home equity loan as evidenced by the sport loan growth our teams had a strong quarter and overall loan production reached record levels as the economy continues to recover we saw a healthy pipeline build and a slight increase in line utilization with the pipeline being up nearly year overyear in prior earnings calls we indicated our expectation for improvement in loan demand and that is now materializing commercial had record production in september and the consumer pipeline jumped year overyear mortgage activity has slowed more recently because of the decline in refinance activity due to higher interest rate due to the higher interest rate environment in addition revenues have decreased as margins have normalized overall we are optimistic that our total loan pipeline indicate a path for sustained growth as we have continued to execute our strategic plan noninterest income reached a record million with strong contributions from capital markets and wealth management as well as solid sba revenue our emphasis on diversifying revenue streams has become even more important during a low rate environment through our efforts of enhancing

quality position gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone our credit portfolio ended the third quarter very well positioned following continued positive results across all of our key credit metrics this solid performance was marked by further improvement in the level of delinquency and nonperforming loans reductions in rated credits and low net losses for both the quarterly and yeartodate periods additionally improving trends across the broader economy and government stimulus have further contributed to these favorable results including deferrals which have reached an immaterial level of only of total loans lets now review some of the highlights for the third quarter the level of delinquency excluding ppp balances ended september at a very solid basis points a 9bp improvement on a linkedquarter basis reflecting a notable improvement in nonaccruals within the commercial book the level of npls and oreo improved to end the quarter at basis points representing a 9basispoint reduction from the prior quarters exppp level the reduction in npls during the quarter totaled million and when compared to the yearago period when npls had reached their peak declined by million representing a solid yearoveryear reduction net chargeoffs for the quarter were very low at million or basis points annualized while yeartodate net chargeoffs were solid at basis points on an annualized basis we recognized a million net benefit in the provision during the quarter following these improvements in our credit quality position this resulted in a gaap reserve position that was down basis point to stand at with the exppp reserve decreasing bps to stand at our npl coverage position further improved ending september at a very solid level of following the noted reductions in npls during the quarter our total ending reserve position inclusive of acquired unamortized discounts totaled in closing we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio moving into the final quarter of the year and the continued progress weve made to further reduce nonperforming and rated credit levels we remain vigilant and attentive to any emerging risks in both the broader economy and within the markets in which we and our customers operate fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 with the continued supply chain and labor disruptions elevated input costs and the evolving nature of the virus our approach to managing and growing our loan portfolio in this highly competitive environment remains balanced and consistent with our timetested credit principles that have served us well throughout the various economic cycles this foundation of sound and consistent underwriting timely and comprehensive management of risk and selectively pursuing opportunities that fit our desired credit profile will support our future growth objectives as we move ahead i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary today i will discuss our financial results for the third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth quarter overall this was a strong quarter and we were very pleased with the result our continued strategic focus on diversified fee income contribution drove noninterest income to a record million up million or linkedquarter leading to record preprovision net revenue of million on an operating basis and a return on tangible common equity reaching nearly our tangible book value per share reached an increase of or on a linkedquarter basis lets walk through the financials in greater detail starting with the highlights on slide third quarter eps increased to up over the prior quarter and from the yearago quarter on a linkedquarter basis total revenue reached a record million an increase of million or and drove net income available to common stockholders to a record million an increase of million or but excluding ppp which is more reflective of the underlying loan growth periodend total loans increased million or annualized on a linkedquarter basis with commercial loans and leases increasing million or annualized and consumer loans increasing million or annualized building on the strong growth generated in the second quarter of this year as vince said this loan growth was across the footprint with production levels higher than last quarter and higher than third quarter of lets continue with the balance sheet on slide reported average loans and leases totaled billion with average commercial loans and leases decreasing million which was entirely due to lower average ppp balances as we saw an acceleration of forgiveness and ended the quarter at million on the deposits side average deposits totaled billion an increase of billion or primarily in noninterestbearing deposit accounts we continue to see a shift in customers preferences for more liquid account in a low interest rate environment as well as maintaining larger deposit account balances than before the pandemic in addition we have also seen an acceleration of deposit accounts opened digitally turning to slide net interest income totaled million an increase of million or from the prior quarter including the ppp contribution and purchase accounting accretion net interest income increased million or reflecting an increase in average loans more favorable funding mix and lower deposit costs we are expecting a slight tailwind for net interest income excluding ppp contribution as a significant portion of our loan growth occurred near the end of the quarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 reported net interest margin increased basis points to reflecting higher ppp contribution of basis points and a 5basispoint benefit from acquired loan discount accretion which was offset by higher average cash balances that reduced the net interest margin basis points excess cash balances grew to billion at quarter end a increase from june when excluding these higher excess cash balances acquired loan discount accretion and ppp impacts net interest margin declined basis points now lets look at noninterest income and expense on slides and record noninterest income totaled million increasing million or from the prior quarter with broad contributions from each of our feebased businesses capital markets income increased million reflecting very strong swap activity with solid contributions from commercial lending activity as well as contributions from loan syndications debt capital markets and international banking service charges increased million reflecting seasonally higher customer activity volumes sba volumes and average transaction sizes continued to be strong with million in premium income included in other noninterest income also included in other noninterest income was a million recovery on a previously writtenoff other asset reported noninterest expense increased million or to million this quarter excluding non operating items noninterest expense increased million or on an operating basis the increase was driven by salaries and employee benefits increasing million or due to production and performance related commissions and incentives consistent with record levels of total revenue which was driven by diversified strong contributions from our feebased businesses overall we produced a strong quarter and believe we are wellpositioned for the fourth quarter now lets turn to fourth quarter guidance on page we expect ppp forgiveness to be million to million with the ppp loan balances decreasing were estimating a range of million to million with the ppp contribution to net interest income compared to the third quarters contribution of million excluding ppp contribution we expect net interest income to be up lowsingle digits relative to the third quarter continuing to benefit from our diversified revenue base we expect noninterest income to be in the high to million for the fourth quarter noninterest expense is expected to be around million on an operating basis which is subject to normal productionrelated incentives and commission as we close out the year we expect the effective tax rate to be between and lastly i would like to quickly review our fullyear guide given last quarter we believe we will meet our loan growth guidance of midsingle digits we expect fullyear gaap revenue to be up yearoveryear which will impact the productionrelated incentives and commissions bringing compensationrelated expenses slightly higher fullyear provision is expected to continue its strong performance with incremental provision dependent on the level of loan growth overall we believe we will finish with solid earnings with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 thanks vince were pleased to announce the howard bank integration thats currently underway and

dedication and drive of our employees it is because of each persons commitment to fnb and our clients that we have been able to achieve record quarterly revenue our employees are the heart of our organization and i want to thank them for their continued hard work with that ill turn the call over to the operator for questions operator question and answer section operator yes thank you at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time well pause momentarily to assemble the roster and this mornings first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hi i just wondered if you could vince you mentioned the billion in excess cash im wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on working that down over time do you expect most of these deposits to stick around what is the expectation for maybe securities builds just trying to accrete this to the bottom line vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no id say the deposits definitely have been very sticky the ppp deposits and we continue to have a positive growth every quarter going back to the first quarter of the goal with the cash level is really the primary goal was to deploy it to fund loans as we move forward from here those opportunities with the howard fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 merger once we close that but probably billion of that to work related to their borrowings so thats an opportunity there and in investment portfolio were basically going to reinvest cash flows we reinvested a little bit more this quarter during the quarter we reinvested million on cash flows of there were some opportunities there to put some money to work but reinvestment rates of are better than the were earning on the cash for sure but still kind of running lower than the runoff rate of in the portfolio so were making the securities portfolio grow up a little bit from here we might reinvest a little bit related to howard securities portfolio that we get between now and actually closing that but the primary goal will be put it to fund loans and then using cash for some of the transaction in the first quarter and in the first quarter frank we take a full look at our whole balance sheet to see if theres other opportunities maybe to deploy some of that cash and maybe other borrowings that we have on our balance sheet frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on howard wondered if you can remind us what the timing of the cost saves being extracted what sort of accretion we should expect from that in specifically and would that include things like you mentioned the borrowings that you could use the cash for vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i guess the overall accretion if you go back to what we announced when we did the model was overall thats kind of on a full year fully phased in basis frank and when we give guidance in january well refresh everything as far as where they come on the balance sheet and all the different drivers for the full year but thats really the most current figure we have frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay just lastly on that just in terms of the cost saves timing i know youve talked about it in the past i just dont recall when you expect those to be fully phased in by vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah frank we mentioned in the first full year we expect to get of the cost saves by end of the year so again a big chunk of that upfront with some of the actions well take and then throughout the year well kind of bring them in and then like i said well get to in the second year frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi timur vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania timur how are you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting on the loan growth this quarter two consecutive nice quarters for commercial loan growth i hear your commentary on seeing utilization rates spike up a little bit gaining some momentum there i guess can you talk through what the utilization rate change was during the quarter and then as you look at loan growth kind of ex the ppp headwind this new momentum that youre gaining how sustainable is this into and maybe can we get an early look at what your expectation is for loan growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania this is vince delie well cover the loan growth when we give guidance for next year so i dont think were going to dive into that right now but if you look at the past two quarters weve had pretty good growth across our geographies if you recall and we stated for some time now that our plan was to expand into multiple geographies where we could create enough scale to compete effectively and drive loan growth with geographic diversity and i think thats happening were seeing growth coming from various parts of our footprint which covers the seven state areas so were seeing some good opportunities in the carolinas charleston is doing very well we expanded the charleston a few years ago and we have a great team there raleigh and charlotte are performing pretty well we got a team in greensboro that continues to perform well over time and then our traditional markets the midatlantic region with our expansion into washington dc and the baltimore markets contributing pittsburgh contributing and know cleveland is picking up momentum so we feel pretty good about where we sit from a utilization perspective weve seen a little bit of increased borrowing on credit facilities that support manufacturing and other areas i think theres still a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines and were still many of our clients are still experiencing supply chain disruption which really prevents them from building inventory position and then you have the issues with commodity pricing for certain borrowers who basically are on the sidelines because of the higher cost of raw materials theyre not stockpiling raw materials for projects and its pretty evident as you read about various aspects of the economy but thats purely reflected in line utilization and then in terms of growth the one thing i will say is that the pipelines have been fairly robust we did close quite a bit in the last quarter so were rebuilding the pipeline the pipeline as i stated in my comments is up doubledigit yearoveryear so were optimistic about that in the commercial space on the consumer side we fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 have a very strong pipeline and thats up yearoveryear so it appears that consumers have been borrowing gary if you could just comment on what we funded in line utilization and what we have in commitments that are out there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah sure vince thanks in terms of commercial line utilization specifically to the quarter we saw a increase so it went from a little over to so almost so that was a positive move upward and touched on some of the things that vince mentioned in the activity and that all said the supply chain issues and pressures across the economy are real so that is holding some of that at bay a bit but it was good to see that that increased during the quarter the other thing that i did want to mention was as we talk about the solid loan growth that we did experience we even saw some significant unfunded closings and future loan growth to come there were about billion of loans that were closed and remain unfunded during the third quarter and those fundings are split between ci as well as cre and thatll fund up over the next months months the tail end of our months but thats a really nice headwind for us from a loan growth standpoint as we look ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for the color maybe just switching gears and looking at some of the technology initiatives that are either already implemented or coming online over the course of the remainder of this year and into next year can you just remind us what your strategy is as far as partnering with third parties versus building out some of the platforms inhouse and as youre starting to go more towards aistyle approach for driving applications is that going to be is part of the underwriting going to be handled by ai as well and if so maybe talk through that process as well vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah our approach is to control the interface so from a proprietary perspective were developing the interface with the client so our estore solution center that i mentioned it was very exciting for us and it opens the door for us to reach millions of customers across our footprint where we may not have physical locations and they can actually go into the website pick a product put it in a shopping cart put multiple products in the shopping cart and then check out by processing multiple applications and what were doing is were continuing to refine that were continuing to add to that offering we are working with a variety of technology companies both large and small to partner with to make that experience better we are developing a proprietary omnichannel application which will permit customers to open multiple products on a single application and thats scheduled to be launched mid next year i think that as we move forward we just added a couple of other products we added loan products we stood up the mortgage origination platform so weve opened about of our total application in the mortgage business for example digitally which includes the ability to upload information in the portal and process transactions so thats all going extremely well and we launched just recently we launched the ability to do consumer loans were going to stand up small business loans with a portal to upload information to help streamline processing fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 so all of that is being built out on the frontend were partnering with various entities large and small pfizer in some respects and then smaller fintech companies to help deliver the products but theyre being delivered within our framework so our strategy is to create the interface control the interface build out the digital bank make it as easy as possible to use and keep refining it and changing it and i think its been extraordinarily wellreceived by our customers weve received a national award for the estore from bcx which is pretty prominent award in the mobile space and when we incorporate that estore into our mobile application which is coming out in november that will open the channel up to even more users so web traffic is up considerably i mean if you look at what weve done i mean weve actually been able to increase usage with our mobile app on a yearoveryear basis really looking at the first quarter of versus the first quarter of because that takes the pandemic into account right so basically were up in mobile banking usage were up in web traffic were up in online banking usage in zelle person to person usage our website also has the ability to schedule appointments through that shopping experience with various bankers or professionals within our company were averaging about appointments per month so its been sustained its peaked at during the pandemic and then has come down as people have greater access to the branches but its still been fairly robust and were averaging about deposit applications per month through that site so i think of all the things we talk about here thats the most exciting part of what were doing and then on the ai side were using analytics for a whole bunch of reasons we developed a team we have both the capabilities selfdeveloped to process large quantities of data so we have the people and we have the infrastructure and data management and a centralized hub to take information from disparate applications and process it fairly quickly millions and millions and millions of bits of information can be processed on our systems by our people and then we have the data analytics team who works with marketing they work with credit they work with finance to utilize artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and to really understand product usage and position products for sale within that estore and within the company so all of thats going on were also using it another example would be the chatbot that we developed and i think that our people are pretty much plugging in to the technology that weve built out and thinking of ways to use it to drive efficiency and revenue growth so very exciting stuff and ill stop there im sorry i went on pretty long but timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats good color vince thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes operator thank you and the next question comes from michael perito with kbw fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning mike gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just have a couple followups i wanted to stick on the technology side for a second there i was curious if you guys have taken a look or have anything incremental you could share about kind of how the unit economics of growing customers is changing as you do more digitally versus kind of the branches historically and maybe kind of weave that answer on the cost side i know you guys arent talking guidance next year yet but the efficiency ratio has been fairly flat and you guys have managed to grow revenues a bit more than expenses i mean is that a dynamic that you think some of these investments can expand moving forward or do you really need rates at this point to kind of drive that efficiency ratio down further vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i think that those investments in technology will help us do two things as we move forward itll help us generate revenue more efficiently because we dont have the legacy infrastructure that we had with a huge branch system for example weve cut over branches since ive been here and have still experienced growth in some markets weve closed branches and because of our digital offering weve actually grown deposits and loans so that to me a clear indication that our cost to originate is much lower than it has been historically moving forward and then the growth that weve seen both from a depository and loan perspective is really aided by those investments in technology and its only going to get better as we become better as we refine that delivery channel and improve it itll become easier for consumers to engage us and get the products and services that they want in a very convenient way and marrying that with the branch people with our clickstobricks strategy is to integrate the branches into that e delivery channel so that we have kind of concierge out there that know where people are shopping or what theyre looking at online and then theyre able to help facilitate sales within the branches so i think its all finally starting to come together weve spent two strategic planning cycles investing in these areas a lot of that investment is behind us i mean obviously theres more to come but a lot of the heavy lifting is behind us and its embedded in our run rate weve said that all along weve not shied away from focusing on that because i truly believe thats the future of the industry and we need to be prepared to compete in that space effectively and i think weve done a great job our people have done a phenomenal job of keeping us in the game fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania plus i would just add an efficiency opportunity to drive all the businesses through that channel weve invested a lot like vince said getting each business trust insurance wealth business all through that channel brings in more revenue more opportunity for customers helps to drive costs down and efficiency ratio so thats another element of it too vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful thank you and then on the noninterest income side i know you guys provided the guide for the fourth quarter i want to talk about two line items specifically though i was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color around the service charge line which saw a really nice rebound is there anything more to that than just kind of a rebound of economic activity i guess number one and number two on the capital markets side anything new from a product or sales process going on within that or should we expect that line i mean maybe not million but to be fairly robust if your commercial growth continues to be positive moving forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well theres two things there when you look at fees related to depository transaction were really growing treasury management fee income weve picked up because of the investments weve made and the new client acquisition strategy were gaining momentum in the fee space for providing treasury management services to commercial clients so a good bit of that growth is attributable to that area and then on the flip side on capital markets when you look at what weve done from a capital markets perspective we continue to build out our capabilities we have a very good team that focuses on syndicating both ci and cre loans so we get paid to syndicate we have a debt capital markets group thats taken off and weve done a number of transactions where were able to participate in bond economics because of our debt capital markets capability that we just completed and built out were focusing on municipal finance weve received the approvals that we need to move forward with generating fee income in public finance we have a fairly robust government lending program so that goes hand in hand so our participation in bond economics within the public finance space will be important moving forward and obviously the derivatives areas the core pretty important core piece of what we offer and weve continued to add good people across our footprint to help us participate in that activity as well so capital markets is really a combination of all of that and then i cant i have to mention our fx capabilities were able to compete very effectively against some of the largest players in the country and have one business in the upper middle market in large corporate space because of our capabilities in fx that was another area which we consider part of capital markets because they do hedging and spot transactions for customers so all of that together provides us with a good strong diverse source of revenue streams within that capital markets business fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful color thank you guys for taking my questions appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike operator thank you the next question comes from russell gunther with da davidson russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co ill just circle back to the loan growth conversation for a second and appreciate the midsingle digit reiteration it assumes about a like amount for the fourth quarter to get there and then garys reminder about consistent underwriting throughout cycles but the strong growth of the past couple quarters that highsingledigit annualized number the growth of your markets youve moved into over the past few years with lpos and ma i mean is there any reason just bigger picture going forward we shouldnt begin to think about fnb as a mid to high singledigit grower rather than midsingle digit and what would keep you from feeling more comfortable towards the higher end of that type of range vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well historically we have been a highsingledigit performer for a long period of time prior to the pandemic if you looked at the average growth rate for the company we were double digits including ma over a sustained period of time and highsingledigit organic loan growth we stripped out the ma contribution and looked at it on an organic basis we used to report that out to the street so as we move through this cycle the disruption that weve experienced which was fairly substantial given the pandemic i think were going to return to those levels and its certainly doable given the investments weve made in our platform if you really look at how were structured for a billion bank to have the opportunity to compete in fairly large markets right where we have a substantial share in those we consider them midsize cities in the southeast in the midatlantic and the northeast we have the potential to do that and were able to do that and still maintain our credit underwriting standards i mean we could grow even faster if we didnt have a great deal of discipline fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 ill let gary comment further on that because hes on the front end of this stuff so i dont know gary if you want to comment gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thanks vince i mean were seeing continued opportunities at a very good pace the diversification of the markets we think is absolutely critical and russell to your question the impact of covid has us from a guidance standpoint in that midsingle range as you can see from the last couple of quarters growth has been strong in that 8pluspercent range so thats kind of where wed like to be thats where we expect to be and i think youll see that as we move forward and put some of these issues behind us that all said there are supply chain issues that are real everyone knows that inflationary pressures labor issues and availability as well as cost so theres a lot of headwinds in the economy that need to continue to be worked through but were very confident in our ability to grow the loan book and we feel good about what weve been able to produce the last couple quarters russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co yeah thank you guys understood on the growth trajectory and then just one kind of tangential followup so the recent ma announcement prior to that youve been pretty successful with the lpo strategy as you think about the model going forward how do you balance or how do you want to balance lpo versus ma and any particular market that you want to move into or scale up in and whats the best way to go about it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah our focus as ive said historically sometimes what i say is taken out of context but ill try to be really clear were really focused on organic growth on making sure the company is positioned to grow to provide benefits to the shareholders so when an ma opportunity comes up like howard sure were going to look at it were going to measure it against other opportunities to invest capital and if we think it makes strategic sense for us to pursue that type of an opportunity well do it in the most shareholderfriendly way we can so returns on capital are important to us weve historically weve said that repeatedly we dont have tons of excess capital our strategy has been to grow tangible book value per share and maintain high returns on tangible common equity so we continue to focus on that and i think the digital strategy and our investments in the digital platform really gives us a considerable amount of upside as an organization if we were a technology company without any revenue people would be valuating us extraordinarily high based upon the potential alone so i look at that and say how do we deploy capital were going to be very cautious about what we do if ma comes about it would have to be something on the smaller end that fits into our footprint that helps us gain efficiency or pick up clients so we can use our investments and technology to drive revenue within that customer base and thats the focus of the company russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co great well thats it for me guys thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 yes thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator thank you and the next question technical difficulty seaport research partners q yeah good morning gentlemen curious most of my questions have been asked and answered but vince maybe as you look across the various geographies and markets are you seeing any difference in term differential in terms of loan pricing or opportunities that stand out more than others thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its extraordinarily competitive across the board i know everybody who said that and i tell my people ive heard that my whole career so please dont tell me that you just have to win right so you have to deliver the best products at the right time structure the deal appropriately so were all secure and the borrower gets what they need and accommodate them so its an extraordinarily competitive environment i think theres spots where the pricing is a little better but its not materially different and if you look at cleveland for example which everybody says is a lowergrowth market theoretically should have less competition its loaded with huge competitors us bank chase huntington keybank pnc so that market is as competitive as charlotte which is loaded with large competitors so we have to execute better we have to stay focused on customers this is still a people business so we have to make sure that our brand is aware people are aware of our brand in the marketplace and they basically have the right people in those markets to drive growth if you look at our strategy from a visibility perspective we went in negotiated opportunities to name buildings in greensboro raleigh charlotte we have a 30story office building with our name in it and charlotte is a very costeffective way for us to promote our brand because we consolidated into that building and moved multiple locations into one building and actually the occupancy expenses are push right or maybe even slightly better we did that in a number of markets because we bought smaller banks and then merged them together we bought big bank that hasnt emerged all the operations so we elevated our profile in all of these cities and we built out on a denovo basis a very good weve optimized the delivery channel from a retail and commercial banking perspective in those markets so long runway and i think that were very well positioned so i hopefully i answered your question q yeah thank you operator thank you technical difficulty stephens inc samuel varga q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 good morning this is samuel varga on for brody preston vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey there how are you samuel varga q analyst stephens inc my first question hey how are you my first question is around some of the fhlb borrowings which you currently hold on the balance sheet i understand that youre planning on using some of the liquidity to pay down borrowings on the howard side but i wanted to ask according to the last few days about billion that was swapped and it was supposed to mature this year and so i just wanted to ask a little bit about what the repricing dynamic is around the new borrowing replacing the old ones vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can tell you the home loan borrowings we have million more to mature in the next four months theres million in november thats basis points and then another million then in january february at million so once those two mature well have million left at and then that piece there well evaluate as part of the kind of first quarter the merger and really look at our whole balance sheet so thats what will be left after that million matures in next four months samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thank you and then moving over to the fee income and thank you for the color you provided on just on the different moving pieces there so i wanted to ask for just a little bit of clarification here the elevated swap fee income is that kind of a reset to a higher run rate or is there is that more of a onetime in nature for this quarter and its going to step back down and if so is there any corresponding offset on the expense side for that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say if you look i mean its definitely a record quarter for us if you look over the last seven quarters weve had three quarters and weve had a north of million and another quarter that had a million handle to it so i mean its a little lumpy because of the capital markets or derivatives side of that business but i think that to vinces point with all the businesses weve invested in international syndication and then the new debt capital markets capabilities we have which has already added million so far yeartodate in its first year of existence i think that will supplement it as we go forward but itll be lumpy i mean our guidance for the fourth quarter doesnt have million in it but it still has a pretty strong number baked into that forecast north of where we were running in in the second quarter samuel varga q analyst stephens inc got it thank you and then a quick last one i just wanted to ask if you could tell me how much of the ppp fees are left to be recognized fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah theres million worth of fees left and then you have interest income on the remaining balance million is left theres million of unaccreted fees to come in and then you earn about million to million of interest income on that over the quarter samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thanks very much for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys good morning vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just a couple quick things for me just back to the ppp for just a minute it seems like most of that gets resolved in the first half of next year i mean you gave some guidance in fourth quarter that gets if you got million left that gets a good chunk of it so maybe first quarter were kind of through ppp is that fair how to think about that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes yeah i think so definitely by the middle of the year brian i would envision it being totally gone the pace of it it moves around right theres clients changes were thinking about tax return filings and when they want to file vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania there were different tranches too so you have to take that into consideration the last billion came on more recently fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the last tranche vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah theres million of the million thats from round two vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so i would expect that to come in over the first two quarters of next year brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay got you okay all right and then just how about vince maybe just on the core margin can you just talk about kind of the puts and takes the next couple quarters here i guess it sounds like you mentioned a little bit of a tailwind maybe with the loan growth but just kind of the puts and takes here in the near term on the core margin kind of excess ppp the liquidity and the accretion vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah ill comment on the dollars brian for net interest income brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania margins theres too many moving parts going into different directions with brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania excess cash on the balance sheet and everything but if you look at the dollars right just ill make a few comments here so net interest income for the quarter went up million million of that was related to ppp and the purchase accounting was down about million ppp was up million fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 so you had million million to million that was related to just kind of core loan growth the solid spot loan growth that we talked about in the second quarter and third quarter obviously contributes to that weve continued to bring down the cost of interestbearing deposits we brought that down another basis points during the quarter so the average for the quarter was basis points and our spot as we sit here today is basis points so theres already kind of another basis points of benefit in the interestbearing deposit costs and then the consumer cds continue to roll down they pick up about basis points a month on cds as they mature so if you kind of put all those pieces in there and then the level of excess cash obviously is significant from a margin perspective right as we could see on that slide that weve reduced the margin by basis points for the quarter so i mean as we start to deploy that that affects the percentage for sure and it also obviously affects the dollars and net interest income so weve earned basis points on that so every dollar that we put to work for loans obviously is additive to the net interest income so kind of that all being said its whats baked into our excluding ppp contribution kind of being up lowsingle digits in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay all right thats helpful and just maybe i just misunderstood what you guys said or i didnt quite kind of get it on the loan growth side but i get the yearoveryear pipelines are up it sounded like given the strength this quarter and the rebuilding that youre kind of going at right now that the is the are the loan pipelines lower today than they were at the start of last quarter or a similar type of level just linkedquarter how did the pipelines change vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it varies it varies the consumer pipeline is stronger so its up as i said it was up substantially the commercial pipeline its up yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis it will be down because we had a huge production brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it was absolutely huge and as gary indicated theres a billion in unfunded commitments that well fund up over time within that big production period that we have so thats how i would look at it commercial rebuild consumer very strong and as we move into the last quarter hopefully they balance each other out and were able to capitalize on some of the larger opportunities we have in the commercial pipeline vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania plus you have the tailwind of the unfunded loans that well start to fund up so that also benefits the loan growth fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and that will carry over into next year as well so thats not just one quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great okay perfect vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay yeah i mean just on the maybe one for gary just on the classified i think you said the rated credits were down gary just can you comment on just what happened with classifieds are criticized in the quarter and then maybe just talk about how we should think about the reserve prospectively given how strong credit appears to be gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah continued positive movement across the criticized categories brian and when you look at this quarter similarly strong as compared to the last quarter about million reduction in  about of that reduction was classified so continuing to be able to move classified assets off the books just in the normal course of other banks refinancing them so our special assets team is continuing to take advantage of that opportunity with the underwriting thats being seen out there so that is a positive move and well continue to take advantage of that in terms of your question around the reserve i mentioned some of the headwinds in the economy before supply chain inflation labor costs and those issues those are real as i mentioned subject to the economy staying strong and moving forward through those issues i would expect that youll see continued slight reductions in the reserve and potentially normalizing as you get into late and into so well see how the economy holds out and well continue to manage that as we go forward naturally loan growth comes into play there as well brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania so something that well continue to monitor on a regular basis and manage accordingly brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay perfect then maybe just one last one if i can sneak it in just on the fee income i think the service charges have been a topic in the industry with i guess i saw the growth this quarter but just as we think about fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 that line item its something that continues to grow at this point or is it just something where you guys are i guess looking at what competitors are doing on the service charge line going forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well it depends on what category within the service line reporting item overdrafts down brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would expect it to dip to trend down we rolled out a product which just received certification where clients cant overdraft and its our secondbest product in terms of sales performance so i expect continued pressure to make changes in that category for the industry not just for us so thats not an area of focus were trying to look for ways to provide we call them highvalue fees to our customers and to build the revenue streams within other categories of the service charge area so treasury management as i mentioned is one area where weve consistently grown double digit in that area but its been muted by other contributors to that category and we expect that to continue to grow there are a number of other products that will start rolling out vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania debit card vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania debit card has done really well it actually rebounded pretty nicely from the pandemic so youre seeing interchange contribution to that category we continue to roll out commercial cards and procurement cards for our clients thats driving interchange fees within the category so like our capital markets strategy were looking for diversification within that area and thats how we would view it going forward this modest growth in that category based upon that the execution and the diversification strategy brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc perfect okay thats helpful thanks vince thanks for taking the questions guys i appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank brian fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings
