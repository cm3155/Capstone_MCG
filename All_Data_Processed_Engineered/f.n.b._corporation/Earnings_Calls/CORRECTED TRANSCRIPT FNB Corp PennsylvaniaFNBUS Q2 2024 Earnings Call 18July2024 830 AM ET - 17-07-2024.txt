generated through targeted deposit initiatives and promotions noninterestbearing deposits ended the quarter over billion an annualized increase of from the prior quarter the mix of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits ended the quarter at a consistent level since december of as we have frequently discussed our strategy has been to price our deposits to protect our peerleading deposit beta while supporting our client base our loantodeposit ratio currently equals we are expecting lower loan originations and implementing a number of deposit initiatives in the second half of the year that will bring our loantodeposit ratio back towards historical levels another longerterm strategic focus has been diversifying our revenue streams achieving stable noninterest income at near record levels million in both the first and second quarters highlights the strength and range of our business model and fnbs robust suite of products and services for the first half of the year noninterest income totaled million a increase over the same period in fee income growth was led by our mortgage banking operations growing over strong wealth management revenue and treasury management fee income growth our success growing noninterest income is expected to continue as we enter the second half of the year fnbs balance sheet strategy is part of our proactive approach to risk management as we draw closer to a reduction in interest rates we continue to move towards a neutral interest rate position to provide stability and potential improvement in margin in a falling rate environment beyond interest rate risk fnbs comprehensive approach to credit risk management has led to strong and stable asset quality and consistent outperformance versus peers our credit team proactively monitors each loan portfolio and overall concentrations at a granular level which has served us well through many economic cycles i will now pass the call over to gary to provide further detail on the overall asset

while proactively managing credit risk through many economic cycles ill now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese jr chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will focus on the second quarters financial results and walk through our third quarter and full year guidance as vince mentioned total loans and leases ended the quarter at billion a linked quarter increase of billion or this growth included million in consumer loans driven by the seasonal peak for residential mortgage originations and million in commercial loans and leases reflecting healthy activity in ci and equipment finance as well as additional growth from fundings on previously committed commercial real estate projects total deposits ended the quarter at billion an increase of million linked quarter including growth in certificates of deposits of million and noninterestbearing deposits of million as the seasonal build in public funds deposits has begun the loantodeposit ratio increased to at june compared to at march we expect this ratio to decline in the medium term both organically and with several initiatives our team has implemented starting on the loan side of the equation the second quarters robust loan growth was higher than forecasted due to seasonality of our mortgage business and stronger commercial client acquisition across the footprint we expect loan growth to return to historical levels for the remainder of the year as pipelines have declined somewhat given a strong production in the quarter and a typical pause in client activity leading up to the presidential election looking at deposits we currently have several depositgathering initiatives targeting both commercial and consumer balances including a strong treasury management pipeline and a new fivemonth cd in consumer money market promotion given the short duration of these promotions we should be able to quickly reprice them lower when rates fall over the past year our deposit growth and mix outperformed the industry and we believe that will continue this past quarter we largely utilized shortterm borrowings to fund the robust loan growth with total borrowings increasing billion when rates start to decrease the cost of these borrowings will move down quickly as vince mentioned over the last several quarters we have been strategically positioning our balance sheet to be more neutral benefit from lower interest rates we have billion of shortterm or floating rate borrowings around billion of nonmaturity deposits that are currently priced at or above a billion cd portfolio with a ninemonth duration and lastly as i mentioned on last quarters earnings call we have around billion of swaps that mature beginning in with rates between and basis points additionally the investment portfolio has an annual cash flow of million at a current rolloff yield of and we have approximately billion of fixed rate loan repayments with an average rate of in the next months in total we have over billion of liabilities and swaps and nearly billion of securities cash flows fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 and fixed rate loan repayments that should provide significant benefit and protection in a falling rate environment compared to the billion of loans that reprice within three months the second quarters net interest margin was basis point decrease largely due to the increased short term borrowings driving a basis point increase in the total cost of funds to this was partially offset by a basis point increase in the total yield on earning assets to our spot deposit cost ended the quarter at leading to a total cumulative spot deposit beta of since the current interest rate increases began in march positioning us well against our competitors net interest income totaled million million decrease from the prior quarter as the higher cost of funds was partially offset by higher loan balances with new origination yields for the quarter around consistent level since the third quarter of we expect the second quarters net interest income to be the trough for the year and should see modest sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarter turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million consistent with the prior quarters strong result the largest quarterly increase was million in service charges driven by treasury management revenues continuing to gain momentum and seasonally higher consumer transaction levels offsetting this growth were declines in capital markets given lower commercial customer transaction activity and lower mortgage banking operations income driven by a slight decline in sold loan volume and net fair value adjustments from pipeline hedging activity operating noninterest expenses were wellmanaged and totaled million an million decrease from the prior quarter after adjusting for million of significant items in the current quarter and million last quarter the largest driver for the decline was salaries and employee benefits which decreased million primarily due to normal seasonal longterm compensation expense of million and seasonally higher employerpaid payroll taxes in the prior quarter the efficiency ratio remained at a peerleading level coming in at second quarter fnbs capital position remained strong and we were able to support robust loan growth and maintain the tangible common equity ratio near and cet1 ratio at both of which remain above our stated operating levels tangible book value per common share was at june an increase of or compared to june of aoci reduced tangible book value per common share by as of quarterend compared to at the end of the second quarter of last year lets now look at guidance for the third quarter and full year of we are maintaining our full year balance sheet guidance loans are expected to grow midsingle digits on a full year basis total deposits are expected to grow low single digits on a yearoveryear basis our mix of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits is anticipated to remain superior to peers our projected full year net interest income expectation is revised to be between billion and billion assuming basis point rate cut in september this revision reflects our interestbearing liability mix as we enter the second half of the year net interest income for the third quarter is expected to be between million and million given the strength of our noninterest income generation in the first half of the year we have increased our full year guide to be between million and million third quarter noninterest income is expected to be between million and million we now anticipate the full year guidance for noninterest expense to be between million and million due to productionrelated compensation given the strong fee income results third quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between million and million the full year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 provision guidance range is lowered to million to million and remains dependent on net loan growth and chargeoff activity in the second half of the year lastly the full year effective tax rate should be between and which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince this year celebrates our 160th anniversary as a

questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys thank you for taking my questions maybe starting on the balance sheet side you talked about a slowing of loan growth in the back half of the year relative to whats been a or what was a pretty strong quarter in the second quarter obviously you had a lot of residential mortgage growth you had some commercial real estate growth and some commercial growth as well maybe you can talk about just the mix that youre expecting in the back half if you expect that slowing to come from the residential side obviously some seasonality in the second quarter here but if thats part of it if youre also seeing expecting a slowing on the commercial real estate side with construction fundings slowing just curious on the mix you expect vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible vince delie i was going to turn it over to vince calabrese indiscernible hey i think a couple of things first of all the mortgage growth is seasonal so weve already started to see as we move into the third quarter we started to see a lower loss in our pipeline so we expect that to come down fairly substantially so less being put on the balance sheet as we move forward there through the second half of the year the construction fundings were on committed primarily committed obligations we do quite a bit where we do the construction financing and its taken out by some form down the road so those fund ups occur as natural funding as we moved through the construction period so that presented growth this quarter and then we had some pretty robust growth in equipment finance weve been doing pretty well there with leases pretty much across the footprint and there were some renewable energy deals that closed i think in the last quarter of last year and the balances there i think weve exceeded billion in balances in that book of business so its grown nicely over time and continues to grow ci has contributed there was some significant growth in the carolinas pittsburgh cleveland contributed so its it was really coming from a bunch of areas really robust in certain areas it appears weve been taking share from others so i think the disruption that occurred really kind of mixed it up with the customer base and gave us an opportunity to get out and fetch new transactions which i think is very positive the growth was higher than i expected but i think its okay because it positions us well moving into given our shifting to a more liabilitysensitive balance sheet and putting those assets on really sets us up for from an earnings perspective that we can continue to generate deposits so i think that on the loan side thats what were guiding our guidance hasnt changed were expecting to produce the same level that we forecasted at the end of the year but its a little lumpy and ill tell you pipelines are down we booked quite a bit this quarter so were moving into the next quarter down about in commercial pipelines and its still a little sluggish on the consumer side so we havent seen as much while weve seen more mortgage first mortgage volume there was much less home equity indiscernible volume so they kind of offset each other and were not expecting that to come back this year so thats how the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 book just performs the only other category i think i didnt speak about was indirect auto i dont know gary what your thoughts are there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah but we had a solid growth quarter in  which is again seasonals very similar to the mortgage were getting really highquality paper there with focus on profitability so improving margins and playing at the high end of the fico band is really working well for us but again thats seasonal were going to pick our spots and manage that through those seasonal periods so we expect that to come down as we move toward the latter half of the year as well vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then from a funding perspective if were able to execute our plan we have seen growth in our treasury management pipeline so were seeing some very large good opportunities where were principal bank that should bring in demand deposits as we move forward i think the bright spot here while we had to fund that growth with borrowings temporarily the upside for us in the long run is to replace that with lowercost funding and i think weve proven that we can do that so the upside into is us replacing those borrowings with deposits and if you look at the demand deposit base its been stable weve been at for several quarters we had growth in demand deposits which youre not seeing across audio gap some pretty decent growth in certain categories where we priced up to bring deposits on we have not been as aggressive as others throughout the cycle and were starting to look at pockets for us to price up to bring in deposits which also leads lowcost deposits in the quarter so our strategy is indiscernible attracting those demand deposits as well vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania our beta performance grows to that point too right its up very gradually from last quarter to so that again is us protecting the overall profitability vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah as you can imagine its a challenging time to navigate we dont want to pull back i think a lot of competitors have shrunk their balance sheet or pulled back i think this is an opportunity for us to go after some share bring in households and do what we do well which is convert them to primary clients so i hope that helps daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah no thats terrific i really appreciate all that color maybe a quick followup just you touched on it at the end there on the funding side but you also mentioned in the prepared comments about deposit initiatives in the back half of the year to kind of rightsize the loantodeposit ratio just curious if you could go into a little more detail about what you were thinking and how that could impact kind of funding costs and then fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we sure weve modified the incentive plans for the consumer bank we have kind of a kicker for deposit growth so shifting the loan growth is pretty minuscule in that segment so we thought hey well incent them to go after deposits we have a number of calling initiatives across the company on larger treasury management opportunities we won a bunch of transactions that havent funded yet which are fairly sizable it seems like clients are willing to talk to us given our performance over this past cycle so weve kind of proven that were capable of handling those relationships throughout cycle and without any issues i think that the people are very focused on it our teams are focused on it and as long as we manage them in that direction and focus mainly on funding thats its going to pay off and the other thing is the estore the investment in digital and the digital technology the interactions are up were starting to get some traction there on the consumer side and then i dont want to get into excruciating detail but theres there are things that we do from an incentive compensation perspective kind of across the board to incent deposit growth and then weve done some things on the mortgage side where weve used data analytics to crosssell customers that we bring in particularly in the physicians book and the jumbo mortgage segment and were partnering with wealth to do some things and brokerage brokerage were working on a money market product that will work handinhand with our brokerage sales which should help so theres a bunch of things going on and i think that its going to take a little bit of time to get some lift out of it but certainly as we move into the second half of this year and into you should see the benefits of everything were doing from a funding perspective daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc all right well terrific thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator the next question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys another strong fee income quarter and guide for continued strength just curious bigger picture if you could share your thoughts as you continue to grow out these businesses where you think you can grow the fee income side of the picture too as a percentage of the total revenue pie and maybe do you see any fee businesses in particular that you want to ramp up or you need to ramp up to get there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think long term this is long term weve talked about this in the past weve put information in our deck we targeted of total revenue we almost got there but then the world changed in terms of net interest income so it diluted that effort but i think thats really the longterm target we want to continue to build out those feebased businesses and make sure that it starts to consume more of the total revenue that target is kind of our target its not something were going to get to immediately but we strive to get there i think weve had great success in capital markets weve done well building out our derivatives platform our syndications platform we have debt capital markets group that we indiscernible the debt offerings i think theres opportunity for us to do things from an advisory perspective i think theres opportunity for us to continue to focus on building out public finance there are things that i think in the future businesses that are bolton businesses that will contribute and help continue to diversify that fee income base given our size and our the span of the company the markets that we compete in i think we have a terrific opportunity to capitalize on those segments and i think once we move into our building i we build a trading floor so that we could bring all those capital markets groups together its fairly impressive i think bringing clients in and showing them that we have these capabilities will lead to additional opportunities for us and then on the wealth side we have opportunities there i think weve only scratched the surface in terms of building out our teams in the markets that we moved into and they were contributing nicely i mean wealth is growing annually every year i think theres for now theres upside weve had records year after year so building out the wealth platform continues and building out those capabilities continues tm theres tremendous upside in treasury management fee income again given the growth of the company and we bought banks in the southeast that really didnt have robust treasury management offerings so as we build out that client base on the commercial side we will see opportunities to grow tm and then the other units mortgage is going to be cyclical and seasonal and then you have but i still expect mortgage to grow gradually over time as we continue to increase market share our team theyve done a terrific job joe cartellone has done a phenomenal job building out the teams and growing share and if you look at the amount of production that weve had even in this offcycle weve outperformed others in the markets that we compete in so weve gained market share i would expect us to continue to do that and then the last piece is insurance we have a decent insurance offering and we have good leadership there and we started to focus on integ rating that even further into our product offering with our commercial bankers that seems to be going pretty well so i think theres upside there its been a little stagnant but i think the insurance market is firming and premiums are increasing and were starting to pick up larger and larger clients so in that space theres upside so were pretty optimistic about those fee income categories and i think it shows in the performance weve consistently kind of touted the capability and discussed what we were building out and i think performance over the last five or six years really illustrates the success weve had vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would just comment that the percent of revenue is a function of the interest rate environment so growing that absolute level given all the initiatives vince talked about has been the key focus and it just keeps building frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 got it okay all right i appreciate and then just maybe as a quick followup just with some slower loan growth relatively speaking to the second quarter some slow growth in the back half of the year and with you guys already above your target capital levels just wondering and i know you bought back a little bit in the second quarter but would you expect buyback activity to maybe ramp up here or are you more price sensitive obviously weve seen a recent rally in bank stocks so just wondering how we should think about buyback activity maybe as you see it today vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would say the level of activity we had in the second quarter was really just to kind of buy back some of the incentive shares that were issued earlier in the year so that we bought as we sit here today the focus on capital kind of building from here at this point we dont have any plans to repurchase shares looking at the second half of the year i mean that can change if the environment changes but right now using the capital to support the loan growth i think the fact that we were able to support the robust loan growth that we had this quarter had capital ratios cet1 hold at and tce ratio in that so holding those levels of capital and supporting the loan growth i think is kind of the best use of the capital at this point and the buybacks will be part of our operation every year as we go forward but as we sit here today i think that the best use is still letting that gradually build a little bit ph as we go through the year frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thanks for the color guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone couple of followup questions on the funding strategy so just wondering what does the guide assume in terms of the borrowings im assuming that stays there or is there an opportunity with these deposit initiatives to pay some of that down vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say that the guide basically has the interest liability position that were entering the third quarter its whats baked into that so the better we do on the initiatives that vince has described theres obviously opportunity to fund additional loan growth as well as replace some of the shortterm borrowings as you commented too the shortterm borrowings are that short term so when the fed does cut the rate on those its going to come down in tandem with the rate coming down so we made a decision during the quarter given the loan growth to kind of forego a little bit of earnings in the short run in the second quarter but position us so that we can benefit from the down rates as we go forward fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc no understood okay and it sounds like these deposit initiatives are it doesnt sound like theyre cds so just wondering to the extent that theyre successful what is the new money rate on these deposits that you hope to bring in versus the borrowing yield vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean itll be a mix casey i mean we still have some level of cds coming in i mean its definitely slowed so the kind of remixing of what it was last year if you look at the second quarter literally we increased cds million on average a month so where we had a high of million last july so the shifting there has definitely slowed but there still customers are still grabbing those rates right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah our people arent incented to originate cds vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right thats indiscernible so i think that the operating account initiatives that vince talked about calling on companies new customers to come in bringing in their operating accounts noninterestbearing is obviously a key focus so its hard to predict with any certainty the mix but itll be a little bit of both and the cd thats there if customers want to grab it before rates start to come down so we have some attractive offerings there i think that the important as we move forward is just growing the total deposits casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah for sure indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just last one for me the slide the balance sheet repricing thanks for sharing that so the new money bond yield on the rolloff rate of just curious what yield youre getting on reinvestment and then that swap with an bp average received rate is that billion does that mature is that ratable throughout just looking for the maturity date on that vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah a couple of comments on that i think we added this content just to give everybody a little more understanding of kind of whats underneath so if you kind of roll through the pieces the cash flow million annual cash flow coming off at i mean today were investing to during the second quarter our guys did a great job opportunistically investing earlier in the quarter kind of south i mean north of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania were speaking to page of the deck just so everybody knows im sorry vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no no its a good point because i do want to talk through that and then these other pieces here would give us some flexibility as we move forward i mean billion of time deposits we have the maturity of nine months and the cd promotions weve had over the last year months months today our best rate is on a five months so the idea is that when the fed does start to move we have the ability ph of withdrawing and we can kind of reprice those so thats an important point we have another billion in nonmaturity deposits ph the break is above those are very repriceable again once the fed moves and even if the fed is expected to continue to move after that first move so that gives us some flexibility the billion of shortterm or floating rate borrowings again those will just reprice down so thats another lever for us and then the billion of swaps at the bottom there casey is really theyre going to mature at a quarter next year basis points is what were giving today i mean thats a negative carry today of million to million a quarter and thats going to start to go away in january casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator the next question comes from russell gunther with stephens please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc maybe just following up on the discussion we were just having given your move toward neutral and some of the balance sheet repricing we just discussed is an initial fed cut still a negative to the nim as deposit cost lag or can some of that fixed repricing dynamic overcome a headwind from an initial step down christine e tvaroch a chief audit executive fnb corp pennsylvania hey russell its chris yeah i think it depends on kind of what the expectation is for cuts kind of after that first cut as vince kind of talked about if that move down rates are expected to continue that gives us a lot more cover to being aggressive on the deposit pricing side id say if its one and done like we kind of have in our guidance there probably is some shortterm timing issues where it probably is a nearterm negative and then there are some timing constraints with how fast we can reprice deposits but if there is several more cuts baked into the curve and thats kind of expected on the client side that gives us a lot more cover to act more aggressively and hopefully we can capture some of that downside data a little bit quicker than we think here russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc okay got it thanks chris and then just could you guys talk about deposit pricing competition in your markets just broadly getting some i dont know mixed messages early in earnings season particularly out of the southeast where some peers are talking about accelerated competition others talking about successfully locking down promo rates just your overall thought would be helpful in terms of where you think deposit costs are headed over the next couple quarters vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think that many of our competitors have kind of shifted once they panicked and priced up deposits to basically through liquidity they have backed off so i think a lot of the larger competitors have backed off a little bit so if youll look at their promotional pricing thats out there youre going to see to basis point reduction versus what was running in the heat the i call it the micro liquidity crisis but i think thats why youre getting mixed signals i think its different for each institution and then all of a sudden youll see somebody emerge and theyll have a really aggressive rate so i think theyve moved people have generally moved companies have generally moved in to a strategy that we had where they were selectively pricing the products and maybe doing a more quiet promotional pricing versus whats on their website so youre going to hear a mixed bag i mean its going to be all over the ph book so i would say its less competitive than it was but in spots theres still some irrational pricing out there so depending on whos calling on your client you need to react to that right so thats where i think we are but i do just in the surveys that we do we do a lot of work on monitoring whos pricing what weve seen a pullback in the stated pricing the promotional pricing thats out there that we can see from many of our competitors so its come down but then like i said every once in a while somebody ph merges with the only aggressive brand fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 the term is coming a lot of the competitors are doing what were doing shortening the duration of the time deposit portfolio by putting out a more aggressive cd thats priced shorter five months three months six months indiscernible the pricings moved in anyway thats what were seeing vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add there too it depends on if the bank is growing loans or not right so depending on who youre talking to vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thats true vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the banks that arent growing loans at all theyre just managing the rates down more because theyre not trying to generate deposits with our growth and bringing in all those new customers its a different environment that you want the deposit you want to bring them in so it really depends on the market and the bank vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania as i read through the earnings releases i can see that i can see our margin contracted because we were lending others have improved their margin right i mean theyve seen inflows of deposits and the pricing is all over the board so its choppy its still competitive and i think people are just retrenching to deal with the situation on an individual basis vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add too the margin compression as vince said it was down basis points for the quarter but if you look at the dollars in net interest income right which is the most critical from a bottomline profitability standpoint i mean we were down million this quarter million decline last quarter indiscernible the quarter before but kind of in line with that and then the goforward as i mentioned earlier more success we have with the deposit initiatives and then rates come down we can reprice all these items on slide that i talked about it gives you that kind of positive momentum as you go forward russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc got it well guys i appreciate both your thoughts on the question i guess the last one for me and understanding it sounds like we are poised to be flat to up on nii going forward but a little incremental pressure overall to the guide would you guys consider another securities portfolio repositioning or how does that currently sit in your opportunity set vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say the net interest income i mean we expect the second quarter to be the trough in net interest income dollars so we do expect it to move up the next couple of quarters just given all the things that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 weve described and then we evaluate the whole balance sheet on a regular basis so as we said with what we did in the fourth quarter were very thoughtful about the size of that the nature of the overall optimization strategy weve deployed so we look at everything so everythings kind of on the table from an investment standpoint but i think were focused primarily on the organic growth in the loans and then all the deposit initiatives to really fund the loan growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it really helps us to bring those households on i mean that helps us in the future helps us generate additional business i think weve done a pretty good job of crossselling to that customer base russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc understood okay guys thats it for me thanks very much for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator the next question comes from manuel navas with da davidson please go ahead manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning if the fed points to kind of a continued down rate cycle could you have upside to the high end of your nii range or would it actually maybe exceed it just kind of some thoughts on that kind of variability that you kind of touched on briefly before christine e tvaroch a chief audit executive fnb corp pennsylvania yeah manuel i think like i said our guide has one cut in it right now and thats it for the year if there were more kind of cuts baked into the curve i think the upside really would show up in i think that sets us up really well for what could look like especially if the curve uninverts after i dont know how long about two years now of inversion so i think that would be more of a impact im not sure it would be helpful but like i said theres some mechanics on the timing of when cds mature some of thats locked in so with five months cds that are coming on now a lot of the repricing happens at the end of the year i think that really sets us up better for vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and our band is pretty tight as you know if you look at the guide for net interest income its a pretty tight band there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co okay the last three years this third quarter has certainly been pretty good deposit growth quarter i think you have some seasonality you touched on in needing flows can you just kind of touch on that kind of just organic better deposit trends this quarter potential vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah go ahead vince vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i was just going to say yeah the normal seasonal surge that we see in deposits particularly on our municipal side happens kind of now through octobernovember timeframe and that could be million to million kind of peak to trough and usually they bottom in the first quarter so thats the seasonality we expect and that would be supplemented by the initiatives vince talked about earlier as far as the commercial and consumer deposits manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co can you release where your nim kind of ended the quarter sometimes you show where its progressed monthly basis vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the monthly i mean the monthly margin there was some noise in the last month of the quarter it was within a basis point or two of the quarterly average manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co okay great thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator the next question comes from kelly motta with kbw please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for the question fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i think youve touched on it a bit but clearly loan growth was incredibly strong and its a great opportunity to win new households and clients to the firm just wondering where youre seeing the greatest opportunity to take share whether its a certain region or segment of the business thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah weve seen some pretty decent growth coming out of the carolinas and i think that continues to be an area with upside for us i think that weve only started to scratch the surface in terms of our calling activity there so theres quite a bit on the table and as we moved into south carolina weve built out building out greenville and south charleston theres a lot of opportunity there for us both from wealth wealth private banking and commercial banking so we continue to see good growth in those areas in charlotte weve had some good success weve had success in the from a deposit perspective weve had great success in wilmington in greensboro so were pretty optimistic about the southeast and then pittsburgh and pittsburgh continues to perform very well we have a lot of upside there we have significant share here in the pittsburgh market so i think in certain business lines were undersized like mortgage i dont think were sized appropriately given the deposit share that we have here so there is some opportunity there for us to continue to grow in the pittsburgh market from a consumer lending perspective and basically from a ci perspective were not penetrating in this market so theres quite a bit to do cleveland had was sluggish over the last few years but i think theres upside in the cleveland market for us in ci and then i mentioned equipment finance i think equipment finance has done very well and should continue to do well as we move through this period get through the election because theres been kind of a holdup on some smallticket capital spending from the ci base well see that release as we move past november when theres more clarity on whats going to happen i think those are the areas that i think have the most upside for us and then on the flip side of that theres less activity going on in cre obviously right ph given these happenings kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats super helpful and then understanding these things take time just wondering if we could get your updated thoughts on ma clearly valuations across the board have improved and especially in light of a potentially more accommodating regulatory environment potentially on the horizon just wondering updated thoughts any thoughts on potentially where you would be looking to add density or fill in thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think its going to be the same answer weve given the last few quarters were going to be opportunistic we are focused internally we have a number of major initiatives going on right now and building out heightened fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 standards capabilities were focusing on building out the digital platform you remember when you came and met with us we had quite a bit that we were tackling that doesnt mean ma is off the table its just that weve been focused internally to strengthen the platform right so that we can grow and expand and benefit from the scale that we put on so i would say its the same well be opportunistic and look for opportunities in market weve been building out virginia on a de novo basis so weve seen a lot of branch announcements in northern virginia indiscernible coming online in the near term and then richmond weve been focusing on and so thats kind of happening organically and then in the carolinas were building out the charlotte market the inner city charlotte market yadkin is largely outside of the city of charlotte so yeah were looking at opportunities to go in there so youll see some de novo expansion in those markets which i think charlotte in particular should bring us some good opportunities from a consumer and small business perspective when we build out that channel kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood you guys certainly have plenty of green shoots internally maybe last question for me just a model refresher here on the expense side you have about a million doublecarry from the excess lease expense while youre still leasing can you remind us does that that doesnt carry through to is that correct or is there any kind of change in plans or timing with the move to the new building james l dutey a chief accounting officer svp controller fnb corp pennsylvania yeah kelly its jim dutey thats exactly right yeah once we move in fourth quarter is our planned movein date at that double carry on the current leases that we have ph will fall in so its not a carryforward into kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome thank you so much vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks kelly vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you kelly operator the next question comes from brian martin with janney please go ahead brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc that expense reduction can you remind us what that is on the building on the property vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its basically the timing of our move we leased a number of locations here because we got a lot of people spread across five locations here on the north shore so it was the timing its the rent expense that started on the building right that were paying rent on all these other locations and so we can ship into the building which were scheduled to do in november early december this year so the question was what happens with that additional rent expense it goes away so were double right now we have double expenses right vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and brian theres a footnote on slide the guidance slide that just we put million of rent expense vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and were not actually paying indiscernible double brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah yeah i got it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we got free rent for the move but from a gaap accounting indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you understood fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay and then just on the funding cost can you talk about i mean can you give any sense on i know you talked about the margin inflecting as far as the cost of deposits kind of do those begin to plateau here i guess theyve been the rate of increase have obviously been narrowing but just i guess when do you expect the deposit cost to kind of plateau vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean its hard to say i mean its still moving up a little bit i mentioned the cd mix shift it definitely slowed quite a bit so if you looked at total deposit costs indiscernible on a spot basis indiscernible in the first quarter if you went back its definitely the increase has slowed i guess it becomes a function of what chris was talking about earlier is if fed does cut and there was an expectation theyre going to keep cutting obviously that gives you more ability to indiscernible that down and all the pieces on slide that i went through theres a lot of levers there and flexibility that again if the expectation is that the fed is going to continue to cut after hopefully cutting in september then all those pieces are in play and have ability to indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but i would say if you look at the makeup of the deposit base its not going to be i dont see pricing increasing to draw in deposits like i said weve seen a number of competitors reduce their promotional indiscernible so i think its more a function of shift so are we able to hold the demand deposits and be able to hold the lowcost interest checking are we able to hold that right without migration i think the outflows have slowed dramatically so we should be seeing right indiscernible vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and the new initiatives that bring in right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania new initiatives are focused more on lower cost deposit categories so i think it should help us but its all a function of mix at this point brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania but from a beta standpoint i guess our beta has been very strong the versus the peers weve been a good bit better than the peers and we would expect that just to gradually go up a little bit more from here probably similar to what it did kind of first and second quarter so just as another indicator brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay thats helpful and then maybe just one for gary on the credit side the stress testing gary i mean anything youre seeing as a sign of weakness or potential concerns given that things sound very good and just a granularity and all the credit performance but as you kind of do the stress test every quarter is anything coming up thats got you maybe more alerted to it or just paying closer attention to it gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania brian i think over the last three quarters now and we stress test as you know every quarter over the last three quarters weve seen improvements from a potential chargeoff and loss perspective so those updates and those reviews around a severe economy continue to show improvement were very very aggressive in managing the book as you all know and that test that our team goes through each and every quarter is really showing positive results for us as we continue to migrate through the current economy brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc sorry okay i think thats really it for me i guess maybe one last just modeling question i think did you guys mention that there were some impairment on the mortgage this quarter or was that did i not hear that right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no just normal fair value marks on the overall portfolio brian thats all i mean that swings i mean quarter to quarter anywhere from million or million one way to million or million the other way so it was just kind of hedging the pipeline brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay thats it guys just want to make sure of that okay thank you guys for taking the questions everything else was answered gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thank you brian fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks brian operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to
