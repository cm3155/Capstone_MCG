regulatory examination and supervision process including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies business and operating results are affected by our ability to effectively identify and manage risks inherent in our businesses including where appropriate through effective use of policies processes systems and controls thirdparty insurance derivatives and capital and liquidity management techniques the impact on our financial condition results of operations financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the impact on the acl due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the current expected credit loss accounting standard or cecl a failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding we caution that the risks identified here are not exhaustive of the types of risks that may adversely impact us and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk factors and other uncertainties described under item risk factors and the risk management sections in this annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorinformationreportsandfilings or the secs website at wwwsecgov we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of our sec filings application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements accordingly as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates assumptions and judgments certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates assumptions and judgments of management and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported the most significant accounting policies followed by fnb are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report these policies along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the consolidated financial statements management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the acl fair value of financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes and dtas to be critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases resulting in the net amount expected to be collected we charge off loans against the acl in accordance with our policies or if a lossconfirming event occurs expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously chargedoff and expected to be chargedoff the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period adjustments are made to the calculation of expected losses to address differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures underwriting standards experience and depth of relevant personnel the quality of our credit review function concentrations of credit external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors such factors are used to adjust the quantitative output based on historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect managements expectation of future conditions based on a rs forecast to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a rs forecast can be made the model reverts over months on a straightline basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans determining the appropriateness of the acl is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation significant changes to the acl level could occur in future periods the provision for credit losses section in the results of operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the acl during the current period see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acl fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures additionally from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for sale certain impaired loans msrs oreo and certain other assets the accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable judgment is required to determine which level of the threelevel hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use significant and complex estimates assumptions and judgments when certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to fair value where available fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent thirdparty sources including appraisers and valuation specialists when such thirdparty information is not available we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility see note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october no impairment was identified in any of our reporting units we also performed a qualitative analysis through yearend and concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was below its respective carrying amount and therefore no triggering event has occurred as of december inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates anticipated cost savings and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook interim quantitative assessments of our goodwill balance could be required in future periods any impairment charge would not directly affect our capital ratios tangible common equity tangible book value per share or liquidity position see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to the income tax laws of federal state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes related regulations and case law in the process of preparing our tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on managements ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law we determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method under this method the net dta or dtl is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur that effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change see the results of operations income taxes section later in this mda for further taxrelated discussion on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on managements current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year dtas and dtls are assessed on an annual basis or sooner if business events or circumstances warrant dtas represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our dtas or when future deductibility is uncertain periodically the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on managements assessments of realizable dtas see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes recent accounting pronouncements and developments note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity operating return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets net loan chargeoffs excluding an isolated commercial loan chargeoff due to alleged fraud to total average loans and leases operating noninterest income operating noninterest expense efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses fdic special assessment realized loss on securities restructuring valuation allowance on auto loans heldforsale initial provision for nonpcd loans acquired and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for and were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of overview fnb

disruption during the second week of march silicon valley bank failed and was taken over by federal regulators the size of the bank being over billion in assets made it the second largest us bank to ever fail subsequently that week signature bank with assets over billion was also closed by federal regulators on may it was announced that first republic bank was another bank closed by federal regulators while these failures were idiosyncratic in nature these events called into question the stability of the entire banking sector and sparked customer fears of potential loss of deposit balances exceeding the fdics insurance limit while the highprofile bank failures had a diminishing effect on public confidence of the banking system the federal government took mitigating action to strengthen public confidence the federal government announced that all depositors of silicon valley bank and signature bank would be protected with any losses to the dif recovered by a special assessment on banks we recognized the special assessment of million in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of in addition to those actions the frb made available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors this action bolstered the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing

wellcapitalized balance sheet and appropriate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our alco as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements fnb also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are available for use to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if faced with a liquidity crisis our strong liquidity position is a result of management utilizing various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs the principal sources of the parent companys liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends and interest it receives from its subsidiaries these dividends may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our

on january the board of directors announced the redemption of all million of our perpetual preferred stock series e which was paid on february after the redemption our liquidity remains appropriate with liquidity metrics continuing to be within policy limits over time our liquidity position has been positively impacted by fnbpas ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements continued strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships across our geographic footprint and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities consistent with industry trends we have experienced a shift in deposits from noninterestbearingdeposits and checking into certificates of deposits cds the march banking disruption caused an acceleration of this shift we ended with approximately of deposits insured by the fdic or collateralized an improvement from approximately at december noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts decreased billion compared to december interestbearing demand deposits decreased million and savings account balances decreased million while time deposits increased billion compared to december as customers preferences have shifted to cds as interest rates have increased substantially our cash balances held at the frb were billion at december a slight decrease of million from december management will continue to evaluate appropriate levels of liquidity based on expected loan and deposit growth and other balance sheet activity our liquidity position was strong throughout our contingency funding policy and periodic liquidity stress testing of multiple stress scenarios was particularly valuable as we successfully managed our liquidity during the march banking industry disruption we continue to have ample unused borrowing capacity that could cover times of the uninsured deposit and noncollateralized deposit balances as of december a portion of this capacity includes the frbs discount window and their btfp we have no borrowings under either facility additional sources of unused wholesale credit availability for fnbpa include the ability to borrow from the fhlb correspondent bank lines and access to other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements at

as a of fnbpa assets table end another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of december compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are expected to mature over the next months than liabilities the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of december compared to as of december the change in the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets was primarily related to the active management of deposit pricing across the deposit product maturity tenors which reduced our asset sensitivity management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by alco table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets table end in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios stress scenarios of our liquidity position and assumptions considering market disruptions lending demand deposit behavior and funding availability the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates change while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates change we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business activities to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco regularly reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of december compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to earning assets table end the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of december and december respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months the change in the cumulative repricing gap at december compared to december is primarily related to customers moving into higher yielding deposit products and shorterterm time deposits the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category we model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps we also model rate scenarios which move all rates in an immediate and parallel fashion rate shocks and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve using a static balance sheet structure and utilizing net interest income simulations the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income on changes in interest rate ramps and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income

management continues to be proactive in managing our interest rate risk irr position with the intention to manage to a more neutral position given the current market expectations for future rates during management has adjusted the irr position by managing cash balances originating higher yielding loans strategically meeting our customers preferences for higher yielding deposit products in particular shorter term time deposits and utilizing borrowings of varying maturities we also utilize derivatives to manage the irr position we continue to make use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase our level of adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of december and as of december as of december the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with million in original notional swap principal originated during up from billion at december furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate shock increases net interest income months by at december and at december for a basis point rate shock net interest income months increases by at december and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate shock are and at december and december respectively these results use historical longterm deposit rate beta assumptions that are regularly analyzed and adjusted as necessary for both rising and falling rate scenarios the drivers of the change in net interest income in the rate scenarios include the mix shift of deposit products the pace of deposit repricing and assumed betas and loan prepayments the fomc increased the federal funds rate basis points in and basis points in the first seven months of fortyeight percent of our net loans and leases reprice within the next three months and are indexed to shortterm sofr prime and other indices which benefit from higher rates our cash position has also been a significant factor in our asset sensitivity metrics projected base net interest income has decreased from yearend as deposit rates have increased faster than asset repricing indices there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve the competitive landscape and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken credit ratings our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and longterm funding and collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies our relative positions in the markets in which we compete our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities pending litigation and other contingencies our reputation our liquidity position diversity of funding sources and funding costs the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings our capital position and capital management practices our corporate governance current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives and the agencies views on whether the us government would provide meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis credit rating downgrades or negative watch warnings could negatively impact our reputation with lenders investors and other third parties which could also impair our ability to compete in certain markets or engage in certain transactions in particular holders of deposits which exceed fdic insurance limits may perceive such a downgrade or warning negatively and withdraw all or a portion of such deposits the following table presents the credit ratings for fnb and fnbpa as of december table table
