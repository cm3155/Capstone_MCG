related to the impact on the acl due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the current expected credit loss accounting standard or cecl a failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns the covid19 pandemic and the federal state and local regulatory and governmental actions implemented in response to covid19 have resulted in increased volatility of the financial markets and national and local economic conditions supply chain challenges rising inflationary pressures increased levels of unemployment and business failures and the potential to have a material impact on among other things our business financial condition results of operations liquidity or on our management employees customers and critical vendors and suppliers in view of the many unknowns associated with the covid19 pandemic our forwardlooking statements continue to be subject to various conditions that may be substantially different in the future than what we are currently experiencing or expecting including but not limited to challenging headwinds for the us economy and labor market and the possible change in commercial and consumer customer fundamentals expectations and sentiments as a result of the covid19 impact including uncertainty regarding the potential impact of continuing variant mutations of the virus us government responsive measures to manage it or provide financial relief the uncertainty regarding its duration and the success of vaccination efforts it is possible the pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance the risks identified here are not exclusive or the types of risks we may confront and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk factors and other uncertainties described under item risk factors and the risk management sections in this annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorinformationreportsandfilings or the secs website at wwwsecgov more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business and societal responses to it we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of this report application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements accordingly as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates assumptions and judgments certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates assumptions and judgments of management and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported the most significant accounting policies followed by fnb are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report these policies along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the consolidated financial statements management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the acl fair value of financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and dtas and litigation reserves to be critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases resulting in the net amount expected to be collected we charge off loans against the acl in accordance with our policies or if a loss confirming event occurs expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously chargedoff and expected to be chargedoff the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period adjustments to historical loss information where applicable are made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures underwriting standards experience and depth of relevant personnel the quality of our credit review function concentrations of credit external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect managements expectation of future conditions based on a rs forecast to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a rs forecast can be made the model reverts over months on a straightline basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans determining the appropriateness of the acl is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation significant changes to the acl level could occur in future periods the provision for credit losses section in the results of operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the acl during the current period see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acl fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures additionally from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for sale certain impaired loans msrs oreo and certain other assets the accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable judgment is required to determine which level of the threelevel hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use significant and complex estimates assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to fair value where available fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent thirdparty sources including appraisers and valuation specialists when such thirdparty information is not available we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility see note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october no impairment was identified in any of our reporting units we also performed a qualitative analysis through yearend and concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was below its respective carrying amount and therefore no triggering event has occurred as of december inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates anticipated cost savings and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook interim quantitative assessments of our goodwill balance could be required in future periods any impairment charge would not affect our capital ratios tangible common equity tangible book value per share or liquidity position see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to the income tax laws of federal state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes related regulations and case law in the process of preparing our tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on managements ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law we determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method under this method the net dta or dtl is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur that effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change see the results of operations income taxes section later in this mda for further taxrelated discussion on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on managements current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year dtas and dtls are assessed on an annual basis or sooner if business events or circumstances warrant dtas represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our dtas or when future deductibility is uncertain periodically the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on managements assessments of realizable dtas see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes litigation reserves the corporation is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted these claims result from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations although the ultimate outcome for any asserted claim cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the corporation has valid defenses for all asserted claims in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we in conjunction with internal and outside counsel handling the matter record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss we continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has previously been established litigation expense represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and factors outside of our control significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our financial liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate see our policy on establishing accruals for litigation in note commitments credit risk and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements and developments note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses initial provision for nonpcd loans acquired branch consolidation costs loss on early debt extinguishment covid19 expenses and gains on sale of visa class b shares are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation costs principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction similarly gains derived from the sale of visa class b stock and losses on fhlb debt extinguishment and related hedge terminations are not organic to our operations the covid19 expenses represent special company initiatives to support our employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for the and periods were calculated

continue to be published through june bank regulators in a joint statement urged banks to stop using libor altogether on new transactions by the end of to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk the frb of new york has created a working group called the arrc to assist us institutions in transitioning away from libor as a benchmark interest rate the arrc has recommended the use of sofr as a replacement index for libor on march the adjustable interest rate act the libor act was signed into law the libor act establishes a uniform national approach for replacing libor in legacy contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined replacement benchmark rate the libor act also directs the frb to issue regulations to implement the legislation addressed by this act we have libor exposure in various agreements including variable rate loans derivatives and debt we issued and acquired we created an internal transition team that is managing our transition away from

growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities this year we also commenced the rollout of the new digital estore kiosks in all fnb branches total deposits increased billion or from december primarily as a result of growth in noninterestbearing demand balances expansion of customer

billion or and now represent of total deposits up from as of december further interestbearing demand deposits increased million or and savings account balances increased million or while time deposits increased million or of which million is attributable to the howard and union acquisitions as of the closing date of the respective acquisitions customer preferences had shifted to more liquid accounts during the lowrate pandemic eras however customers preferences have begun to shift back to certificates of deposits as interest rates have increased our strong liquidity position provided us the flexibility to reduce our fhlb borrowings by million and eliminate howards overnight borrowings and retire million of howards highercost fhlb borrowings our cash balances held at the frb decreased billion from yearend to billion at december as cash was deployed primarily to fund loans and investments fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits and other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements at december we have billion of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities to total assets or this compares to a policy minimum of the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable

securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets table end the increase in unused wholesale credit availability was due to increased borrowing capacity with the fhlb another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of december compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are repricing over the next months than liabilities and net interest income would benefit if interest rates were to rise the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of december compared to as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by alco the change in the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets is primarily related to the active deployment of cash into loans and securities table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets table end in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates change while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates change we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco regularly reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of december compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets table end the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of december and respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at december compared to december is primarily related to the active deployment of cash into longer duration loans and investment securities as well as lower projected prepayment rates on the loan and security portfolios the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category using a static balance sheet structure and utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of december the measures do not reflect managements potential actions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table table start december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points table end we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve the comparative percentages are based on the projected base net interest income at the respective measurement dates assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by at december and at december for a basis point rate ramp net interest income months increases by at december and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate ramp are and at december and respectively these changes are a direct result of our managing our interest rate exposure to benefit from higher rates management has reduced our exposure to higher interest rates over the course of as prospects for additional frb interest rate increases has moderated fortyeight percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to shortterm libor sofr and prime that reprice within the next three months our cash position related to increased deposits has also been a significant factor in our asset sensitivity metrics the deployment of cash into loans and investments as well as a higher base net interest income due to the increase in the loan indices are the primary factors of the change in the percentage sensitivity since december the fomc increased the federal funds rate by basis points in and our balance sheet is positioned to benefit in the near term from further fomc increases of the federal funds rate there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits management continues to be proactive in managing our interest rate risk irr position with the nearterm objective of having loan and investment cash flows reprice at a faster pace than deposit and borrowing costs during the current higher interest rate environment in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of december and as of december as of december the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with billion in original notional swap principal originated during as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive as evidenced by a lower deposit repricing beta than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics further during management has adjusted our irr position by opportunistically deploying excess cash balances into higher yielding loans and securities we have also made use of derivatives to manage the irr position with the most recent transactions being the execution of received fixed pay floating 1month libor and sofr interest rate swaps that have a remaining life of years for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of
