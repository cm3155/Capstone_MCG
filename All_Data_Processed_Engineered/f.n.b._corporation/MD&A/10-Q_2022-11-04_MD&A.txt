herein and our annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorinformationreportsandfilings or the secs website at wwwsecgov more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business

policies a description of our critical accounting policies is included in the mda section of our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february under the heading application of critical accounting policies there have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since december use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses initial provision for nonpcd loans acquired and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation costs principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for the and periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of financial summary net income available to common stockholders for the third quarter of was million or per diluted common share compared to net income available to common

reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year including stock issued to employees libor and sofr the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca who is the regulator of libor announced on march that they will no longer require any panel bank to continue to submit libor after december as it pertains to us dollar libor the fca announced that certain libor tenors will continue to be published through june bank regulators in a joint statement urged banks to stop using libor altogether on new transactions by the end of to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk the frb of new york has created a working group called the alternative reference rate committee arrc to assist us institutions in transitioning away from libor as a benchmark interest rate the arrc has recommended the use of sofr as a replacement index for libor on march the adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act was signed into law the libor act establishes a uniform national approach for replacing libor in legacy contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined replacement benchmark rate the libor act also directs the frb to issue regulations to implement the legislation addressed by this act we are currently evaluating the impact that the libor act will have on us we created an internal transition team that is managing our transition away from libor this transition team is a crossfunctional team composed of representatives from the commercial retail and mortgage banking lines of business as well as representatives of loan operations information technology legal finance and other support functions the transition team has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition identified contracts that contain libor language reviewed existing contract language for the presence of appropriate fallback rate language developed and implemented loan fallback rate language for when libor is retired and identified risks associated with the transition the transition team has chosen sofr as the primary replacement index for libor but other creditsensitive indices are available for the benefit of our customers beginning in september adjustable rate mortgage loans have been originated with sofr as the underlying index their balance as of september was million an increase of million compared to december we started originating commercial loans utilizing sofr and other indices in the fourth quarter of as of september the balance of commercial loans indexed to sofr was billion including certain libor loans

interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period at september and december we utilized a thirdparty consensus macroeconomic forecast reflecting the current and projected macroeconomic environment for our acl calculation at september the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included but were not limited to i the purchase only housing price index which reflects growth of over our rs forecast period ii a commercial real estate price index which reflects growth of over our rs forecast period iii sp volatility which decreases in and in and iv bankruptcies which increase steadily over the rs forecast period but average below historic levels macroeconomic variables that we utilized for our acl calculation as of december included but were not limited to i the purchase only housing price index which reflected

table in millions september december change change noninterestbearing demand interestbearing demand savings certificates and other time deposits total deposits total deposits increased billion or from december primarily as a result of growth in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand balances due to the howard acquisition as well as an expansion of customer relationships and higher customer balances customer preferences had shifted to more liquid accounts during the lowrate pandemic era however customers preferences are beginning to shift back to certificates of deposits as interest rates increase the deposit growth helped us eliminate overnight borrowings reduce highercost shortterm fhlb borrowings and provide cash to be used for funding loan growth capital resources and regulatory matters the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives the ability to engage in expanded business activities the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend in part on our capital position the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the consolidated balance sheet asset quality liquidity earnings performance and sustainability changing competitive conditions regulatory changes or actions and economic forces we seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence we have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec pursuant to this registration statement we may from time to time issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock preferred stock debt securities depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts or units on april we announced that our board of directors approved an additional million for the repurchase of our common stock through our existing share repurchase program bringing the total authorization to million since inception we repurchased million shares at a weighted average share price of for million under this repurchase program with million remaining for repurchase the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions the purchases will be funded from available working capital there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time the inflation reduction act of includes a excise tax on stock repurchases beginning january capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for fnb and fnbpa updated at least annually these capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of years beyond the current year from time to time we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans we may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our wellcapitalized status fnb and fnbpa are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies see discussion under enhanced regulatory capital standards quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require fnb and fnbpa to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tier and cet1 capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and a minimum leverage ratio as defined failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements dividends and future business and corporate strategies under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action fnb and fnbpa must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices fnbs and fnbpas capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors at september the capital levels of both fnb and fnbpa exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes in december the frb and other us banking agencies approved a rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing bhcs and banks including fnb the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl over a threeyear period in march the frb and other us banking agencies issued a final rule that became effective on march and provides bhcs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology for the acl on regulatory capital we have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule as a result under the final rule we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital until after a twoyear deferral period which for us extended through december beginning on january we were required to phase in of the previously deferred capital impact of cecl with an additional to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of under the final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire dayone impact at adoption plus of the subsequent change in the acl during the twoyear deferral period as of september the total deferred impact on cet1 capital related to our adoption of cecl was approximately million or basis points which will continue to be reduced by approximately million annually in this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels demonstrating our expected ability to continue to support our constituencies under stressful financial conditions following are the capital amounts and

discretionary bonus payments doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of doddfrank act the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under part i item business government supervision and regulation included in our annual report on form 10k as filed with the sec on february liquidity our goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of fnb with costeffective funding our board of directors has established an assetliability management policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with longterm goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk a wellcapitalized balance sheet and adequate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our alco as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements fnb also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are available for use to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we would be faced with a liquidity crisis the principal sources of the parent companys liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries these dividends may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb the cash position at september was million up million from yearend primarily due to the million net proceeds from a senior debt offering in august part of which will be used to retire debt in february of for additional information see note borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and months of cash on hand mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios are presented in the following table table september december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months management has concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities this year we also commenced the rollout of the new digital estore kiosks in all fnb branches total deposits increased billion or from december primarily as a result of growth in noninterestbearing demand balances expansion of customer relationships as well as interestbearing demand balances due to the howard acquisition we continue to have success growing total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts as they rose billion or and now represent of total deposits up from as of december further interestbearing demand deposits increased million or and savings account balances increased million or time deposits increased million or due to the fomc increasing interest rates customer time deposit balances grew in the third quarter the first quarter of growth in our strong liquidity position provided us the flexibility to reduce our fhlb borrowings by million and eliminate howards overnight borrowings and retire million of howards highercost fhlb borrowings our cash balances held at the frb decreased billion from december to billion at september as cash was deployed primarily to fund loans and investments fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits and other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements at september we have billion of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities to total assets or this compares to a policy minimum of the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable unpledged securities table  in millions september december unused wholesale credit availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets the increase in unused wholesale credit availability was due to increased borrowing capacity with the fhlb another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of september compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are repricing over the next months than liabilities and net interest income would benefit if interest rates were to rise the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of september compared to as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by alco the change in the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets is primarily related to the active deployment of cash into loans and securities table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates change while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates change we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of september compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of september and december respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at september compared to december is primarily related to the active deployment of cash into longer duration loans and investment securities as well as lower projected prepayment rates on the loan and security portfolios the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of september using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table september december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve the comparative percentages are based on the projected base net interest income at the respective measurement dates assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by at september and at december for a basis point rate ramp net interest income months increases by at september and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate ramp are and at september and december respectively these changes are a direct result of our managing our interest rate exposure to benefit from higher rates and our asset sensitivity fortynine percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to shortterm libor sofr and prime that reprice within the next three months our cash position related to increased deposits has also been a significant factor in our asset sensitivity metrics the deployment of cash into loans and investments as well as a higher base net interest income due to the increase in the loan indices are the primary factors of the change in the percentage sensitivity since december the fomc has increased the federal funds rate by basis points thus far in and our balance sheet is positioned to benefit from further fomc increases of the federal funds rate there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits our current interest rate risk irr position is intended to benefit from higher interest rates management continues to be proactive in managing the irr position with the near term objective of having loan and investment cash flows reprice at a faster pace than deposit and borrowing costs during the current higher interest rate environment in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of september and as of december the acquisition of howard was the primary driver of the decline of this metric as of september the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with million in original notional swap principal originated during the first nine months of as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive as evidenced by a lower deposit repricing beta than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics further during management has adjusted our irr position by opportunistically deploying excess cash balances into higher yielding loans and securities we have also made use of derivatives to manage the irr position with the most recent transactions being the execution of received fixed pay floating 1month libor interest rate swaps that have a remaining life of years for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk reputational risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the board of directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns as such the board monitors a series of kris or key risk indicators for various business lines operational units and risk categories providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite these results are reviewed periodically by the board of directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement and where appropriate adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks we support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management the joint risk committee of our board of directors and the fnbpa board of directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances the risk committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following identification measurement assessment and monitoring of enterprisewide risk development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit market liquidity legal regulatory and operating risk including technology operational compliance and fiduciary risks and identification and implementation of risk management best practices the risk committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the risk management council which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our board risk committee as noted above we have a risk management council comprised of senior management the purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure management has also established an operational risk committee that is responsible for identifying evaluating and monitoring operational risks across fnb evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the risk management council the risk management council reports on a regular basis to the risk committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprisewide risk profile and other significant risk management issues our chief risk officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprisewide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas including the following departments which all report to the chief risk officer to ensure the coordinated and
