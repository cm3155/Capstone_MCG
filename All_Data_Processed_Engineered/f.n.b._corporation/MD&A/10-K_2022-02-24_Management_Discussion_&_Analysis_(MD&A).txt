item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes presented in item of this report results of operations for the periods included in this review are not necessarily indicative of results to be obtained during any future period cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information this report may contain statements regarding our outlook for earnings revenues expenses tax rates capital and liquidity levels and ratios asset quality levels financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations these statements can be considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forwardlooking statements involve various assumptions risks and uncertainties which can change over time actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forwardlooking statements and may not align with historical performance and events as forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements forwardlooking statements are typically identified by words such as believe plan expect anticipate intend outlook estimate forecast will should project goal and other similar words and expressions we do not assume any duty to update forwardlooking statements except as required by federal securities laws our forwardlooking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties our business financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business economic and political circumstances including but not limited to i developments with respect to the us and global financial markets ii actions by the frb fdic ust occ and other governmental agencies especially those that impact money supply market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry iii a slowing of the us economic environment iv inflation concerns v the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the us or its global trading partners and vi the sociopolitical environment in the us business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses including where appropriate through effective use of systems and controls thirdparty insurance derivatives and capital management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards competition can have an impact on customer acquisition growth and retention and on credit spreads deposit gathering and product pricing which can affect market share loans deposits and revenues our ability to anticipate react quickly and continue to respond to technological changes and covid19 challenges can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic crisis dislocations risks associated with a postpandemic return to normalcy including shortages of labor supply chain disruptions and shipping delays terrorist activities system failures security breaches significant political events cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically legal regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses financial condition results of operations competitive position and reputation reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention liquidity funding and the ability to attract and retain talent these developments could include changes resulting from the current us presidential administration including legislative and regulatory reforms different approaches to supervisory or enforcement priorities changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry regulatory obligations or restrictions consumer protection taxes employee benefits compensation practices pension bankruptcy and other industry aspects and changes in accounting policies and principles changes to regulations or accounting standards governing bank capital requirements loan loss reserves and liquidity standards unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries these matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies including fines penalties restitution or alterations in our business practices and in additional expenses and collateral costs and may cause reputational harm to fnb results of the regulatory examination and supervision process including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies the impact on our financial condition results of operations financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the impact on the acl due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the current expected credit loss accounting standard or cecl a failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns the covid19 pandemic and the federal state and local regulatory and governmental actions implemented in response to covid19 have resulted in an increased volatility of the financial markets and national and local economic conditions increased levels of unemployment and business failures and the potential to have a material impact on among other things our business financial condition results of operations liquidity or on our management employees customers and critical vendors and suppliers in view of the many unknowns associated with the covid19 pandemic our forwardlooking statements continue to be subject to various conditions that may be substantially different in the future than what we are currently experiencing or expecting including but not limited to a prolonged recovery of the us economy and labor market and the possible change in commercial and consumer customer fundamentals expectations and sentiments as a result the covid19 impact including uncertainty regarding the potential impact of continuing variant mutations of the virus us government responsive measures to manage it or provide financial relief the uncertainty regarding its duration and the success of vaccination efforts it is possible the pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance our acquisition of howard presents us with risks and uncertainties related to the integration of the acquired business into fnb including the business of howard going forward may not perform as we project or in a manner consistent with historical performance as a result the anticipated benefits including estimated cost savings of the transaction may be significantly more difficult or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events including those that are outside of our control the integration of howard including its banking subsidiary howard bank with that of fnb and fnbpa may be more difficult to achieve than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results in addition to the howard transaction we grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves regulatory issues and the integration of the acquired businesses into fnb after closing the risks identified here are not exclusive or the types of risks we may confront and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk factors and other uncertainties described under item risk factors and the risk management sections in this annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorinformationreportsandfilings more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business and societal responses to it we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of this report application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements accordingly as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates assumptions and judgments certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates assumptions and judgments of management and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported for example on january we adopted cecl under the cecl methodology the acl represents the expected lifetime credit losses on loans and leases that we do not expect to collect the most significant accounting policies followed by fnb are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report these policies along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the consolidated financial statements management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the acl fair value of financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and dtas and litigation reserves to be critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases resulting in the net amount expected to be collected we charge off loans against the acl in accordance with our policies or if a loss confirming event occurs expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously chargedoff and expected to be chargedoff the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period adjustments to historical loss information where applicable are made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures underwriting standards experience and depth of relevant personnel the quality of our credit review function concentrations of credit external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect managements expectation of future conditions based on a rs forecast to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a rs forecast can be made the model reverts over months on a straightline basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans determining the appropriateness of the acl is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation significant changes to the acl level could occur in future periods the provision for credit losses section in the results of operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the acl during the current period see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acl fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures additionally from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for sale certain impaired loans msrs oreo and certain other assets the accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable judgment is required to determine which level of the threelevel hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use significant and complex estimates assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to reflect fair value where available fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent thirdparty sources including appraisers and valuation specialists when such thirdparty information is not available we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility see note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october no impairment was identified in any of our reporting units we also performed a qualitative analysis through yearend and concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was below its respective carrying amount and therefore no triggering event has occurred as of december inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates anticipated cost savings and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook interim quantitative assessments of our goodwill balance could be required in future periods any impairment charge would not affect our capital ratios tangible common equity tangible book value per share or liquidity position see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to the income tax laws of federal state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes related regulations and case law in the process of preparing our tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on managements ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law we determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method under this method the net dta or dtl is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur that effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change see the results of operations income taxes section later in this mda for further taxrelated discussion on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on managements current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year dtas and dtls are assessed on an annual basis or sooner if business events or circumstances warrant dtas represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our dtas or when future deductibility is uncertain periodically the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on managements assessments of realizable dtas see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes litigation reserves the corporation is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted these claims result from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations although the ultimate outcome for any asserted claim cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the corporation has valid defenses for all asserted claims in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we in conjunction with internal and outside counsel handling the matter record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss we continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has previously been established litigation expense represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and factors outside of our control significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our financial liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate see our policy on establishing accruals for litigation in note commitments credit risk and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements and developments note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets acl to loans and leases excluding ppp loans preprovision net revenue to average tangible common equity efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses branch consolidation costs loss on early debt extinguishment covid19 expenses and gains on sale of visa class b shares are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction similarly gains derived from the sale of visa class b stock and losses on fhlb debt extinguishment and related hedge terminations are not organic to our operations the covid19 expenses represent special company initiatives to support our employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap

through june bank regulators in a joint statement have urged banks to stop using libor altogether on new transactions by the end of to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk the frb of new york has created a working group called the arrc to assist us institutions in transitioning away from libor as a benchmark interest rate the arrc has recommended the use of the sofr as a replacement index for libor similarly we created an internal transition team that is managing our transition away from libor this transition team is a crossfunctional team composed of representatives from the commercial retail and mortgage banking lines of business as well as representatives of loan operations information technology legal finance and other support functions the transition team has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition identified contracts that contain libor language has reviewed existing contract language for the presence of appropriate fallback rate language developed and implemented loan fallback rate language for when libor is retired and identified risks associated with the transition the transition team has chosen sofr and other creditsensitive indices as a replacement to libor these selected indices are available for the benefit of our customers and are utilized in all new floating rate agreements we started originating commercial loans in the fourth quarter of utilizing sofr and other indices residential mortgage loans indexed to sofr have been originated since october of our transition team continues to work within

the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical through the cycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period covid19 impacts on the acl beginning in march the broader economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the covid19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables utilized in our acl modeling process based on these changes we utilized a thirdparty pandemic recessionary scenario from the first quarter of through the third quarter of for acl modeling purposes at december and december we utilized a thirdparty consensus macroeconomic forecast due to the improving macroeconomic environment for our acl calculation at december the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included but were not limited to i the purchase only housing price index which reflects growth of over our rs forecast period ii a commercial real estate price index which reflects growth of over our rs forecast period iii sp volatility which increases in and in and iv bankruptcies which increase steadily over the rs forecast period but

costeffective funding our board of directors has established an assetliability management policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with longterm goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk a wellcapitalized balance sheet and adequate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our alco as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department fnbpa generates liquidity from its normal business operations liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements fnb also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are used to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we would be faced with a liquidity crisis the principal sources of the parent companys liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries these dividends may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb the cash position at december was million down million from december due primarily to million in share repurchases management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the lcr and mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios are presented in the following table table table start december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months table end management has concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities we have also increased customer deposit relationships due to the success of the ppp total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion or from december total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts grew billion or and interestbearing demand deposits increased billion or savings account balances increased million or time deposits declined million or as customer preferences continued to shift away from longer term certificates of deposit to lower yielding more liquid products in addition customers maintained larger balances in their deposit accounts than before the pandemic as mentioned earlier inflows from ppp and government stimulus checks were a significant factor in the deposit growth as a result of the strong deposit activity total borrowings were reduced by million and our cash balances held at the frb increased billion from yearend to billion at december fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits and other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements at december we have billion of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities to total assets or this

paycheck protection program liquidity facility ppplf as the frb ceased lending money under this program effective july we had availability of billion at december and at december we never borrowed under this facility unused funding availability absent the decline in ppplf grew by million our strong cash position would also be available to meet our pledging requirements another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of december compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of december compared to as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by alco table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets table end in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates rise we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation economic value of equity eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of december compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets table end the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of december and respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at december compared to december is primarily related to growth in deposits as mentioned earlier inflows from ppp and government stimulus checks were a significant factor of growth in noninterestbearing balances the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of december using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table table start december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points table end we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by or million at december and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate ramp are and at december and respectively deposit rate assumptions are floored at zero in the negative scenarios the frbs rapid and large downward interest rate moves in march as a response to the covid19 pandemic lowered all market interest rates specifically prime rate and 1month libor fifty percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to prime onemonth libor and onemonth term sofr our increased cash position related to increased deposits has also been a significant factor in our metrics assuming no replacement the estimated impact of available cash in the 200shock scenario above accounts for of the total asset sensitivity these factors were the primary drivers of the increase in asset sensitivity in this historically lowrate environment our strategy is to remain asset sensitive to benefit from future increases in interest rates there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk irr position in response to the change in interest rates management was proactive in managing our irr position as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings also we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the average maturity of the certificates of deposit volumes this continues to be a focus of management furthermore management took advantage of the interest rate environment to reduce borrowing costs management has reduced the level of borrowings by million this year on the lending side we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of december and as of december as of december the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with billion in original notional swap principal originated during this year we also executed billion in receive fixedpay floating 1month libor interest rate swaps with an average life of 36years as a hedge to additional asset sensitivity for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report the investment portfolio is also used in part to manage our irr position we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk reputational risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the board of directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns as such the board monitors a series of kris or key risk indicators for various business lines operational units and risk categories providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite these results are reviewed periodically by the board of directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement and where appropriate adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks we support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management the joint risk committee of our board of directors and the fnbpa board of directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances the risk committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following identification measurement assessment and monitoring of enterprisewide risk development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit market liquidity legal regulatory and operating risk including technology operational compliance and fiduciary risks and identification and implementation of risk management best practices the risk committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the risk management council which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our board risk committee as noted above we have a risk management council comprised of senior management the purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure management has also established an operational risk committee that is responsible for identifying evaluating and monitoring operational risks across fnb evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the risk management council the risk management council reports on a regular basis to the risk committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprisewide risk profile and other significant risk management issues our chief risk officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprisewide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas including the following departments which all report to the chief risk officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of

disaster as discussed in more detail under the covid19 section of this report we have in place various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our crisis management team incident management team and business continuity coordinators to activate our plans for various types of emergency circumstance further our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our audit committee each of the risk audit credit risk and cra committees of our board of directors regularly report on riskrelated matters to the full board of directors in addition both the risk committee of our board of directors and our risk management council regularly assess our enterprisewide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues the board of directors believes that our enterprisewide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to assess the quality of the information they receive understand the businesses investments and financial accounting legal regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that fnb faces oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk and assess appropriately the quality of our enterprisewide risk management process reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating
