lines the growth in network volumes drove increases in discount revenue our largest revenue line and processed revenue service fees and other revenue increased percent yearoveryear primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues net card fees grew percent year over year as new card acquisitions increased and card member retention remained high demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions net interest income grew by percent yearoveryear primarily driven by growth in loans partially offset by higher paydown rates on loan balances card member loans grew percent yearoveryear which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base provisions for credit losses increased resulting in a lower net benefit in the current quarter as compared to a year ago primarily due to a lower net reserve release in the current quarter partially offset by lower net writeoffs the reserve release in the current period was primarily driven by a reduction in pandemicdriven reserves reflecting sustained recovery from the macroeconomic impact of the covid19 pandemic while delinquency and net writeoff rates remain well below prepandemic levels they increased modestly on a sequential basis as compared to the prior quarter card member rewards business development and card member services increased yearoveryear due to spend growth and higher usage of travelrelated benefits card member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel marketing expense increased percent yearoveryear due to higher investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions we continue to see great demand for our products and a wide range of attractive investment opportunities operating expenses increased percent yearoveryear primarily due to prioryear net

diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of march we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to

extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by employees or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries for example as previously disclosed beginning in may we began responding to a regulatory review led by the office of the comptroller of the currency and the department of justice civil division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales in january we received a grand jury subpoena from the united states attorneys office for the eastern district of new york regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a civil investigative demand from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb seeking information on sales practices related to consumers we are cooperating with all inquiries into our sales practices and related compliance practices we continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally take disciplinary and remedial actions where appropriate and provide information regarding our reviews to our regulators including the federal reserve we do not believe these matters will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the form 10k for further information consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by

in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly focusing on consumer financial protection for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu and uk payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu and the uk given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu or the uk broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network on april the reserve bank of india imposed restrictions on the ability of american express banking corp to engage in certain card issuing activities in india from may until it complies with a regulation requiring storage of payment

states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally our card members or our business in addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the form 10k antitrust litigation we continue to vigorously defend antitrust and other claims initiated by merchants see note to the

the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions on payment products issued by american express the amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment or merchant discount varies with among other factors the industry in which the merchant conducts business the merchants overall american expressrelated transaction volume the method of payment the settlement terms with the merchant the method of submission of transactions and in certain instances the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us eg local or global and the transaction amount discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the card member transaction occurs american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited card acceptance agreements which include the agreedupon terms for charging the merchant discount fee vary in duration our contracts with small and mediumsized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods which typically range from three to seven years in duration our fixedperiod agreements may include autorenewal features which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached we satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term often on a daily basis including through the processing of card member transactions and the availability of our payment network in cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party which is the case for example under our optblue program or with certain of our network partners we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the card member transaction occurs service fees and other revenue service fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees which are generally recognized in the period when the service is performed and delinquency and foreign currencyrelated fees which are primarily recognized in the period when they are charged to the card member in addition service fees and other revenue includes income losses from our investments in which we have significant influence and therefore account for under the equity method processed revenue processed revenue primarily represents amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners in our role as the operator of the american express network we settle with merchants on behalf of our network card issuing partners the amount of fees charged for accepting american expressbranded cards are generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as processed revenue at the time the card member transaction occurs our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contrarevenue within processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as expense in business development processed revenue also includes other fees related to network partnership agreements and fees earned on alternative payment solutions all of which are generally recognized when the service is performed business development business development expense includes payments to our cobrand partners corporate client incentive payments earned on achievement of preset targets and certain payments to network partners these costs are generally expensed as incurred marketing marketing includes costs incurred in the development and initial

company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited reserves for credit losses reserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period which is approximately three years beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the rs period the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recoveries for each month of the rs period beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to longterm average loss rates pd models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be writtenoff ead models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of writeoff this includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios the ead models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from card members after default occurs typically as a result of collection efforts future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions we also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions that are incorporated over the rs period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party management reviews these economic scenarios each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product gdp that are significant to our models we also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in our assessment may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves higher or lower to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models such as external conditions emerging portfolio trends the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due accounts or management risk actions lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics such as past spend and remittance behaviors credit bureau scores where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of reserves for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and within the provisions for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income rather than reversing interest income separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and days past due for term loans loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited

jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments we were required to pay the vat assessments prior to contesting our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class

tort contract application of tax laws antitrust and consumer protection claims some of which present novel factual allegations andor unique legal theories while some matters pending against us specify the damages sought many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated the claimed amount may be exaggerated andor unsupported as a result some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery andor development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings an accrual is recorded when it is both a probable that a loss has occurred and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on a quarterly basis developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses as applicable for those disclosed legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accruals related to those matters this range represents managements estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such legal proceedings evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments to
