calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies business environment our results for the year reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen in our business throughout and our strategy of investing in our customers brand and talent is helping in our effort to drive share scale and relevance spending on our network reached record levels and credit metrics remained around historic lows net income more than doubled versus the prior year to billion and exceeded levels contributing to this increase in net income in the current year was a billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments yearoveryear comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in due to the covid19 pandemic as certain of the pandemicrelated restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved and through the successful execution of our investment strategy we saw a steady recovery in our business with certain key areas growing beyond prepandemic levels in worldwide network volumes for the year increased percent compared to the prior year and reached levels billed business which represented percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results increased percent and continued to show different paces of recovery for gs and te spend gs spend which accounts for the majority of our billed business grew by percent on a yearoveryear basis and was percent above levels this growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and cardnotpresent spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to levels global te spend grew percent versus the prior year reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year which resulted in fourth quarter te volumes reaching percent of levels the yearoveryear growth in billed business was led by the us where spend increased percent versus the prior year and exceeded levels by percent primarily driven by us consumers and small and midsized enterprises total revenues net of interest expense increased percent yearoveryear reflecting double digit growth in all our noninterest revenue lines discount revenue our largest revenue line increased percent yearoveryear driven primarily by growth in card member spending other fees and commissions and other revenues increased yearoveryear primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues net card fees grew consistently throughout and were up percent year over year as new card acquisitions increased and card member retention remained high demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions net interest income declined percent versus the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances card member loans increased percent which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit primarily due to a billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net writeoffs in the current year the reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables we do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased yearoveryear due to growth in spend and higher usage of travelrelated benefits additionally our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our membership rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travelrelated categories during the year we increased marketing investments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased card member engagement and strong retention rates our operating expenses for were in line with however the current year included sizeable net gains associated with the amex ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in we expect to continue to invest strategically in marketing value propositions on our products technology and our colleagues table of contents during the year we returned billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and divided payments which resulted in us ending the year with our common equity tier cet1 capital ratio back within our target range of to percent we plan to continue to manage our cet1 capital ratio within our target range we also expect to increase our dividend payment by approximately percent in the first quarter of

is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our assetliability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our global proprietary cardissuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary cardissuing businesses where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding in addition we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities we aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by tenor and by investor base among other factors mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument tenor or investor we seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility our direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time we expect the balance of these deposits to continue to grow our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth our liquidity position and choice of funding sources as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments in executing our funding plan we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of shortterm and longterm refinancing requirements funding programs and activities we had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of december table summary of customer deposits and consolidated debt table start billions customer deposits shortterm borrowings longterm debt total debt and customer deposits table end we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our funding plan for the full year includes among other sources approximately billion to billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately billion to billion of secured term debt issuance actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity and funding needs demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these factors are beyond our control in order to simplify our funding and reporting structure in october we terminated the commercial paper program at american express credit corporation credco and credcos committed syndicated bank credit facility the undrawn amounts from which could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding concurrently we established a new commercial paper program at american express travel related services company inc trs and a new credit facility with american express company and trs as coborrowers and coobligors as described further below we also completed an exchange offer on november in which american express company issued billion of new senior notes with a coupon and may maturity in exchange for the same amount of outstanding senior notes with the same coupon and maturity issued by credco following completion of the exchange offer million of credcos senior notes with may maturity remain outstanding due to the limited amount of publicly issued debt outstanding credco deregistered from ongoing sec reporting beginning january credco will continue to finance certain card member receivables and loans using intercompany borrowing as its primary funding source our equity capital and funding strategies are designed

discretion of the rating organization downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs table of contents deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on among other factors the capital level of aenb direct retail deposits offered by aenb is our primary deposit product channel which makes fdicinsured highyield savings account and certificates of deposit cds products available directly to consumers aenb also offers checking account products and sources deposits through thirdparty distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of december we had billion in deposits refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits shortterm funding programs shortterm borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interestbearing overdrafts with banks our shortterm funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of shortterm borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december we had nil commercial paper outstanding and an average of nil in commercial paper outstanding during refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings

longterm debt obligations we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our us card business as the securitization market provides us with costeffective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to

above table of contents liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities through our us bank subsidiary aenb we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserves discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include marketwide firmspecific and combined liquidity stresses we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of december we had a total of billion in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities which are substantially comprised of us government treasury obligations the decrease of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the increase in the balances of our card member loans and receivables debt maturities share repurchases and a reduction in customer deposits partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances in the net interest costs to maintain these resources were substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields table of contents securitized borrowing capacity as of december we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes

provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of billion as of december this facility was maintained by our wholly owned subsidiary credco through september and the availability of the credit line was subject to compliance with certain covenants by credco principally the maintenance by credco of a ratio of its combined earnings certain capital contributions and fixed charges to fixed charges effective october this facility was terminated and we entered into a new committed syndicated bank credit facility for the same amount with a maturity date of october with american express company and trs as coborrowers and coobligors the availability of the new credit facility is subject to our maintenance of a minimum cet1 riskbased capital ratio of percent with certain restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our cet1 riskbased capital ratio falls between percent and percent as of december we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the new credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility we may from time to time use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding the new credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating offbalance sheet arrangements we have certain offbalance sheet obligations that

obligor or security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards and term loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the highquality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ermc as appropriate credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decisionmaking models that use uptodate information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus we have developed datadriven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our gcs and gmns businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by clientspecific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate

monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to among other things inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or impacts from the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with

derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments interest rate risk we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixedrate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variablerate from fixedrate or vice versa refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments as of december a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately million on our annual net interest income a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelvemonth time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interestrate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelvemonth horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes it is further assumed that within our interestrate sensitive liabilities certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on among other factors the direction of rate movements these assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates table of contents libor transition we have an enterprisewide crossfunctional initiative to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the london interbank offered rate libor engage with industry participants customers and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates such as the secured overnight financing rate as part of this initiative we have amended and continue to amend contracts to replace references to usd libor tenors that will cease to be quoted after june and have updated our operational processes it systems and models for a timely transition see the discontinuance of libor may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements under risk factors for additional information foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency crosscurrency transactions and balances from our funding activities crosscurrency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately billion were outstanding with respect to card member spending and crosscurrency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding the impact of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december with respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would be approximately million as of december to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses table of contents funding liquidity risk management process funding and liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due our boardapproved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management funding and liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee to manage this risk we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making damage to our reputation or customer harm from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes model risk is managed through a comprehensive risk management and governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance and model related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner in addition we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning aiml models for a variety of business use cases we perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these aiml techniques result in adverse consequences strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following executive committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees table of contents country risk management process country risk is defined as the risk that economic social andor political conditions and events in a country present they might adversely impact us primarily as a result of greater credit losses increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital we manage country risk as part of the normal course of business policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure climaterelated risk we define climaterelated risk as risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy legal technology market and reputational risks and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events eg cyclones hurricanes floods and chronic physical risk which are longerterm shifts in climate patterns eg sea level rise chronic heat waves such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact to our customers operations suppliers and business climaterelated risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk operational risk market risk liquidity risk and other risk types we continue to enhance our focus on climaterelated risk within our risk governance framework we are currently performing a risk identification process for climaterelated risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk furthermore environmental social and governance esg issues with an emphasis on climaterelated risk are currently identified as an emerging risk within our risk governance framework table of contents critical accounting estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses these quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment the primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate rs period the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the rs period the qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure we consider certain external and internal factors including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for card member credit losses the rs period which is approximately three years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period to determine expected credit losses beyond the rs period we immediately revert to longterm average loss rates card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff no later than days past due within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party the estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect managements judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gdp that are significant to our models table of contents macroeconomic sensitivity to demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario for every percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario the estimated credit losses increased by approximately million the modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios under different conditions or using different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes in addition this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering managements judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component which may have a positive or negative effect on the results thus the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used in conjunction with other inputs described above to calculate reserves for card member credit losses the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period table of contents liability for membership rewards the membership rewards program is our largest cardbased rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the weighted average cost wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point assumption is derived from months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million table of contents goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unitspecific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units internal multiyear forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples eg earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from managements current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties table of contents other matters recently adopted accounting standards refer to the recently adopted accounting standards section of note to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected

pay over time and plan it that allow card members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and
