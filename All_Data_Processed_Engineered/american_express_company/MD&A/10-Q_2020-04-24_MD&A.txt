policies and minimum capital standards business environment in early march covid19 a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was characterized as a pandemic by the world health organization since december covid19 has spread rapidly with most countries and territories worldwide with confirmed cases of covid19 and a high concentration of cases in the united states and many other countries in which we operate the rapid spread has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns the pandemic and these containment measures have had and are expected to continue to have a substantial negative impact on businesses around the world and on global regional and national economies as the covid19 pandemic unfolded globally we moved quickly to transition our colleague base to a fully remote working environment in all our locations we have sought to ensure our colleagues feel secure in their jobs and have the flexibility and resources they need to stay safe and healthy to support our customers and merchants we are offering financial and other assistance to help them through this difficult period adding product benefits to reflect todays environment and continuing to provide the high level of customer service they expect and rely on we are also working with several of our strategic partners on initiatives to support our communities in the united states we launched our stand for small coalition to provide assistance programs designed to help small businesses manage through the crisis and we are working with our hotel partners to provide hotel rooms free of charge to frontline medical professionals during the first two months of while covid19 was primarily limited to specific countries in asia and europe we continued to see solid growth in line with previous quarters during the second half of march the sharp contraction of the global economy triggered a dramatic decline in our business volumes which continued into april to the extent that we continue to see significant yearoveryear declines our future results will be materially impacted our billed business for the quarter was down only modestly as the covid19 impacts discussed above became more impactful as the quarter drew to a close during the first two months of the quarter our worldwide billed business increased percent over the prior year followed by a percent yearoveryear decline in billings for the month of march resulting in an overall yearoveryear decline of percent for the quarter while us billed business declined percent versus the prior year international billings declined by percent on an fx adjusted basis due to the earlier impact of covid19 in asia and europe our proprietary consumer and commercial billed business declined by and percent yearoveryear respectively with the more rapid decline in commercial primarily driven by a dramatic drop in te spending as corporations reduced spending and governments implemented travel restrictions revenues net of interest expense decreased percent yearoveryear with strong growth in the first two months of the quarter offset by a decline in march consistent with the trend in billings discount revenue our largest revenue line decreased percent for the quarter and percent in the month of march the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to a decrease in the average discount rate the average discount rate declined by basis points for the full quarter and by basis points in march both relative to the same periods in the prior year due to a shift in spend mix to nonte categories if the spending trends we experienced at the end of march and into april continue we anticipate seeing a further decline in the average discount rate in the second quarter we also saw covid19 related declines in other fees and commissions and other revenues primarily due to declines in consumer travel commissions and fees and reduced crossborder spending respectively card fee revenues which are recognized over a twelvemonth period are slower to react to economic shifts and we therefore continued to see a growth in yearoveryear revenues as the pace of new account growth slows in the current environment we would expect to see a modest slowdown in net card fee growth net interest income grew by percent yearoveryear driven by higher average card member loans during the quarter and higher net yields the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into us dollars ie assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared during the first two months of the quarter we saw continued strong growth in card member loans however this was offset by a sharp decline in march which resulted in average loans for the quarter up percent yearoveryear with the card member loan closing balance down percent yearoveryear in addition due to significant decline in billings in the month of march card member receivables were lower by percent yearoveryear as of the end of the quarter provisions for credit losses increased due to a significant reserve build that reflected the deterioration of the estimated global macroeconomic outlook as a result of covid19 impacts the latest macroeconomic outlook reflects a more significant deterioration in united states gross domestic product gdp and unemployment than when we closed our books for the first quarter if those forecasts were to hold or worsen by the time we close our second quarter financials we would expect to have another large reserve build during the quarter we created a customer pandemic relief program for customers who have been impacted by covid19 as of april approximately billion of card member and other loans and approximately billion of card member receivables were enrolled in the program based on balances at the time of enrollment card members rewards and services and business development expenses are generally correlated to billings or are variable based on usage and were impacted this quarter by the decline in billing volumes and lower usage of travelrelated benefits as governments implemented restrictions to contain the spread of covid19 for the rest of the year we expect to reduce our proactive marketing efforts as well as decrease operating expenses while reinvesting in initiatives and product benefits to support our longterm growth strategy we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and capital and liquidity profile as well as broad and welldiversified funding sources this provides us with significant flexibility to maintain the strength of our balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress looking ahead there is great uncertainty on when the economy will improve our financial performance for the remainder of the year will depend on i when and how strongly card member spending rebounds as the global economy recovers and ii how long the challenges of high unemployment levels and small business shutdowns last and the impact on our credit losses at this time we cannot determine the answers to these questions our framework for managing through this challenging economic environment is built on four principles supporting our colleagues and winning as a team protecting our customers and our brand structuring the company for growth in the future and remaining financially strong we will remain focused on what we can control in the short term while identifying opportunities across our businesses to position ourselves for growth in the longer term see certain legislative regulatory and other developments and risk factors for information on additional impacts of covid19 and related containment efforts as well as other matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition critical accounting estimates please see the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a full description of all of our critical accounting estimates the critical accounting estimate related to reserves for card member credit losses presented below has been updated to reflect the adoption of the current expected credit loss cecl methodology reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that include a significant amount of judgment primarily related to the determination of the appropriate rs period the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions and the determination of the probability of and exposure at default all of which are ultimately used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to calculate the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses on card member loans and receivables the rs period which is approximately years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions we obtain our forecasts of future economic conditions from an independent third party and in determining the relevant rs period for card member loans and receivables we also consider information arising from other internal processes as well as our own past loss experience card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff within the rs period within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment would then be allocated to the remaining balance as noted above cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple economic scenarios eg baseline better and worse obtained from an independent third party the expected credit losses calculated from each economic scenario are weighted to reflect uncertainty around the baseline economic scenario we determine the weighting of each scenario based on our detailed review of the externally sourced information and comparing other economic information we use throughout other processes macroeconomic sensitivity reserves for credit losses are sensitive to various inputs and assumptions which may differ by portfolio macroeconomic forecasts are critical inputs into our models and inherently contain multiple variables of which the us unemployment rate and us gdp growth rate are the most significant to our estimated expected credit losses both variables moved dramatically during the quarter and drove a significant credit reserve build at december the us unemployment rate and gdp growth quarteroverquarter was percent and percent respectively at march our weighted economic scenarios obtained from an independent third party primarily assumed in the second quarter the us unemployment rate peaks between approximately percent to percent and us gdp declines quarteroverquarter approximately percent to percent seasonally adjusted to annualized rates the combination of the material movements in these variables together with overall changes in our portfolios related to volume and mix resulted in a build to our reserves for credit losses of billion these macroeconomic forecasts under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates could result in significantly different changes in reserves for credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall reserves for credit losses and current results may not reflect the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes refer to the business environment and table in mda and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the impact of cecl both at implementation and for the quarter ended march the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within

information on covid19 and the related impacts on our results as a result of the adoption of cecl on january there is a lack of comparability in the both the reserves and provisions for credit losses

fees increased primarily driven by growth in the platinum delta and gold portfolios as well as growth in certain key international countries japan united kingdom mexico and india compared to a year ago card fees which are recognized over a 12month period are slower to react to economic shifts and therefore the impacts of covid19 were not a significant driver of the yearoveryear change other fees

higher average card member loans and higher yields although average card member loans were higher during the quarter ending card member loans at march decreased percent as compared to march the

tied to the product relaunch these pricing changes as well as changes in the expense classification of certain benefits with the relaunch resulted in higher marketing and business development lower card member rewards and lower card member services expenses as compared to the prior year marketing and business development expense increased primarily due to the delta changes described above

weighted assets american express company in billions march riskbased capital common equity tier tier capital tier capital total capital riskweighted assets average total assets to calculate the tier leverage ratio we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements specifically within a to percent target range for american express common equity tier riskbased capital ratio and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels at american express or aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express or aenb to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are definitions for our regulatory riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance riskweighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and offbalance sheet items are weighted for risk with offbalance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents using risk conversion factors before being allocated a riskadjusted weight offbalance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total riskweighted assets common equity tier riskbased capital ratio calculated as common equity tier capital cet1 divided by riskweighted assets cet1 is

most recent quarter in december federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the cecl methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments effective january in march the federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to temporarily delay for two years the estimated impact of the adoption of the cecl methodology on regulatory capital followed by the threeyear phasein period the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital will be phased in at percent per year beginning january we have elected to adopt the march interim final rule as of march our reported regulatory capital excluded the billion impact to retained earnings upon the adoption of the cecl methodology and percent of the impact of the billion increase in reserves for credit losses for the quarter on march the federal reserve issued a final rule to replace the percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic stress capital buffer which has a floor of percent under the rule the stress capital buffer equals i the difference between a banking organizations starting and minimum projected common equity tier capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenario plus ii one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets and will be reset each year based on the banking organizations annual stress testing results the rules changes to the capital conservation buffer will take effect october following the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar we submitted our capital plan by april as required by the federal reserve the federal reserve is expected to publish the results of its supervisory stress tests for all banking organizations participating in ccar which should indicate the size of each firms stress capital buffer by june share repurchases and dividends we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the three months ended march we returned billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and share repurchases of billion we repurchased million common shares at an average price of in the first quarter of due to the current level of uncertainty in the business environment we have suspended share repurchases to maintain our financial strength in addition during the three months ended march we paid million in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility while we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that direct deposits such as the personal savings program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time given the significant reductions in our business volumes and changes in growth outlook we do not currently expect to have meaningful unsecured or secured term debt issuances for the remainder of summary of consolidated debt we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of march and december table summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits billions march december shortterm borrowings longterm debt total debt customer deposits total debt and customer deposits we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moodys investor services moodys standard poors sp and

our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of march we had cash and cash equivalents of billion the increase of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the decline in the balances of our card member loans and receivables the net interest expense to maintain these liquidity resources depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields as the amount of our liquidity resources has increased the level of future net interest expense to maintain these resources is expected to be significant as the investment income is less than the cost of funding securitized borrowing capacity as of march we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of march no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility on april we added approximately billion of us corporate card member receivables to the charge trust federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately billion as of march in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of march of billion with a maturity date of october as of march no amounts were drawn on this facility unused credit outstanding and certain contractual obligations as of march we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members in april we prepurchased billion worth of hilton honors points which we may use for future promotions rewards and incentive programs for our joint customers the points prepurchase program is part of a preexisting contractual agreement between us and hilton worldwide holdings inc that was negotiated in prior years and already contemplated in our capital and liquidity planning cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the three months ended march table cash flows billions total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash net increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i noncash items included in net income such as provisions for credit losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the decrease in net cash related to operating activities was primarily driven by the significant decline in billed business in the month of march resulting in lower accounts payable and other liabilities cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by a decline in the balances outstanding from card member loans and receivables as card members continued to pay down outstanding balances combined with a significant decline in card member spending during march and a net decrease in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher net repayment of debt partially offset by higher growth in customer deposits other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations an increasing range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the form 10k for further information government responses to covid19 pandemic in response to the covid19 pandemic authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns in addition to these measures which have substantially curtailed household and business activity fiscal and monetary policy measures have been deployed for the stated purpose of attempting to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy in the united states this has included the enactment of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and a number of emergency lending and liquidity facilities established by the federal reserve among other things the cares act created a new loan guarantee program we started participating in called the paycheck protection program ppp designed to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses the cares act also provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend i certain requirements under us gaap for loan modifications related to covid19 that would otherwise be treated as troubled debt restructurings and ii any determination that a loan modified as a result of covid19 is a troubled debt restructuring including impairment for accounting purposes there have also been various governmental actions taken or proposed to provide forms of relief such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees governmental actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic have not always been coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have been expanding in scope and intensity the efficacy and ultimate effect of these actions is not known we continue to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to covid19 and their potential impact on our operations payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network for more information on payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k surcharging in various countries such as certain member states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts our business in addition other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the form 10k consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and

case we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants see note to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the cases it is possible that actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business for more information on the

operations and cash flows there were no significant changes to our accounting policies business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance effective january we adopted the new credit reserving methodology applicable to certain financial instruments known as the current expected credit loss cecl methodology under a modified retrospective transition the cecl methodology

statements unaudited reserves for credit losses reserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to calculate a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the rs period the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key parameters probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recoveries for each month of the rs period beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates pd models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be writtenoff ead models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of writeoff this includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios the ead models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors future recoveries are the amounts received from card members after default occurs typically as a result of collection efforts future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions these three parameters calculate the quantitative future expected credit losses we also consider the likelihood a previously written off account will be recovered this calculation is dependent on how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions which estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and reviewed by management these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain geographic based variables that are influential to our modelling process including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product the process of estimating credit reserves incorporates the above factors over the rs period explicitly considering macroeconomic forwardlooking information additionally we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models such as external factors portfolio trends or management risk actions lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics including past spend and remittance behaviors credit bureau scores where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others we report losses on accrued interest within provision for credit losses rather than reversing interest income separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually using a discounted cash flow model see note for information on troubled debt restructurings loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and days past due for term loans loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon

through discovery andor development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings an accrual is recorded when it is both a probable that a loss has occurred and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on a quarterly basis developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses as applicable for those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accruals related to those matters this range represents managements estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such legal proceedings evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience
