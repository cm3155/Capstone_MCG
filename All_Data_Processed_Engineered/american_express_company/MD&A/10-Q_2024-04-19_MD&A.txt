continued investments in value propositions marketing technology capabilities and our brand which are driving high levels of customer engagement and loyalty the successful execution of our growth strategy along with the strength of our premium customer base and differentiated business model drove net income of billion or per share compared with net income of billion or per share a year ago billed business the most significant driver of our financial results increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis in line with the overall spend environment we have seen the past few quarters us consumer services billed business grew by percent yearoveryear reflecting continued strength in spending trends across all generational cohorts with the largest portion of this growth coming from our millennial and genz card members international card services billed business grew by percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis driven by continued growth in spend across all regions and customer types outside the united states commercial services billed business grew by percent on a yearoveryear basis reflecting continued modest growth from us small and midsized enterprise sme card members total revenues net of interest expense increased percent yearoveryear the growth in billed business drove a percent increase in discount revenue our largest revenue line net card fees increased percent yearoveryear reflecting high levels of new card acquisition and card member retention as well as our cycle of product refreshes net interest income increased percent versus the prior year primarily reflecting growth in our revolving loan balances which has moderated over the last several quarters as well as continued net yield expansion versus the prior year total loans and card member receivables increased percent yearoveryear as our card members continue to spend and build balances provisions for credit losses increased primarily driven by higher net writeoffs partially offset by a lower net reserve build in the current year net writeoff and delinquency rates remained bestinclass supported by our premium global customer base our strong focus on risk management and disciplined growth strategy card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and collectively increased yearoveryear primarily due to growth in billed business and premium card accounts as well as higher usage of travelrelated benefits the yearoveryear growth in these variable customer engagement expenses for the quarter was partially offset by a benefit related to enhancements to the models that estimate future redemptions of membership rewards points by us card members resulting from our periodic evaluation of our liability estimation process and assumptions marketing expense increased percent yearoveryear as we continue to invest in acquiring high spending high quality customers and other growth initiatives during the quarter we acquired million proprietary new cards operating expenses were flat yearoveryear reflecting higher compensation costs to support business growth offset by net losses on amex ventures investments in the prior year we remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies over time while continuing to invest in our growth strategy during the first quarter we maintained our capital ratios within our current target range of to percent and returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends we also increased our quarterly common stock dividend by percent we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while managing our cet1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth our robust capital funding and liquidity positions provide us with significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet as previously announced we signed an agreement to sell fraud prevention solutions provider accertify inc a wholly owned subsidiary we acquired in the operations of which are reported within the global merchant and network services segment the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of upon closing we expect to recognize a sizeable pretax gain which will be recorded as a reduction to other expense and is expected to be substantially reinvested back into our business our performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and the evolving regulatory and competitive landscape we remain committed to executing on our strategy to

under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs on august the us federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that if adopted as proposed would require covered bank holding companies such as

extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governments and regulators are increasingly requiring financial services firms and payment systems to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations compliance programs and governance frameworks the development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies may increase our operational complexity and compliance costs result in enforcement actions and penalties and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network governmental authorities have also focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example as previously disclosed we are cooperating with governmental investigation s related to our historical sales practices which are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in addition various bank regulators have announced they are reviewing credit card rewards programs for compliance with certain consumer protection laws and regulations as previously disclosed we identified during an internal review that certain us card members were not credited certain membership rewards points they had earned and we have taken actions to remediate it and enhance our related procedures we are cooperating with regulators in their ongoing regulatory examination of rewards and benefits programs external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further

payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on march the cfpb issued a final rule that lowers the safe harbor amount for credit card late fees that would be considered to be reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments to eliminates a higher late fee safe harbor amount for subsequent late payments and eliminates the annual inflation adjustment for the safe harbor amount the final rule has an effective date of may however it is being challenged in litigation which could delay or if such challenge is successful halt implementation of the final rule we are assessing the impact of the final rule and how we intend to comply with it if it goes into effect in the absence of providing a cost justification to support a late fee higher than the safe harbor amount which would be permissible under the final rule we would be required to reduce our late fees resulting in a decrease to our delinquency fee revenue in

fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants for example we exited our network business in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu in a ruling issued on february the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of fee capping and other provisions in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements on august
