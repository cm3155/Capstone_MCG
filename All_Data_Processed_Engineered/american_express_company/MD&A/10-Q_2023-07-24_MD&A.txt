management objectives are to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we continue to see volatility in the capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances capital we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on riskadjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by colleagues to maintain a strong balance sheet provide flexibility to support future business growth and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases see dividends and share repurchases below we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements specifically within a to percent target range for american express companys common equity tier cet1 riskbased capital ratio

strong liquidity profile we aim to satisfy our financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by tenor and by investor base among other factors mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument tenor or investor we seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits unsecured debt and asset securitizations and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility summary of consolidated debt we had the following

actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity and funding needs

unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least per account holder through the fdic as of june approximately of these deposits were insured our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on among other factors the capital level of aenb direct retail deposits offered by aenb is our primary deposit

funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a

cash and cash equivalents respectively refer to the cash flows section below for a discussion of the major drivers impacting cash flows for the six months ended june the investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances from time to time including in this quarter interest income may exceed the interest expense associated with the liquidity portfolio depending on the interest rate environment our funding composition and the amount of liquidity resources we maintain the level of future net interest income or expense associated with our liquidity resources will vary securitized borrowing capacity as of june we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity

determining the amount of collateral we can borrow against the amount of borrowing capacity available to aenb at either the discount window or the btfp is subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge as of june aenb had available borrowing capacity of billion as a result of us credit card loans and charge card receivables that were pledged to the federal reserve through the discount window it also had approximately billion in us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities that could be pledged through the btfp whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve due to regulatory restrictions liquidity generated by aenb can generally be used only to fund obligations within aenb and transfers to the parent company or nonbank affiliates may be subject to prior regulatory approval consistent with historical practice during the second quarter of we performed test draws on the discount window and the btfp to ensure operational readiness for accessing the facilities no amounts were outstanding on either facility as of june unused credit outstanding as of june we had approximately billion of unused credit outstanding primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit outstanding does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset

to our merchants to settle daily transaction volume and payments related to annual incentive compensation in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from

supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example as previously disclosed we are cooperating with governmental investigations related to our historical sales practices which are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements

deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on february the cfpb issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered by regulation to be reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments the proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe harbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above percent of the consumers required minimum payment on march the cfpb adopted a final rule requiring covered financial institutions such as us to collect and report data to the cfpb regarding certain small business credit applications

have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants for example we exited our network business in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally
