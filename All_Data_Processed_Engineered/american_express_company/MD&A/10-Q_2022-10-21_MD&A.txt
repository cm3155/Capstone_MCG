environment our results for the third quarter reflect strong performance and continued strength in our premium card member base despite uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment we continue to invest in our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage which is driving growth across our businesses our network volumes for the third quarter increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis and billed business which accounts for the majority of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis the increase in billed business across our segments was driven by sustained growth in goods services spending and the continued momentum in te spending including te spending in our international markets exceeding prepandemic levels on an fxadjusted basis us consumer billed business grew by percent yearoveryear reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium us consumer card members billed business in our commercial services segment grew by percent on a yearoveryear basis reflecting continued strength in spending by our us small and midsized enterprise customers as well as continued recovery in spending by our us large and global corporate clients international billed business grew by percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis driven by increased spending by both consumer and commercial customers inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth while the continuing strengthening of the us dollar relative to the prior year against most major currencies in which we operate had a negative impact on our international billings total revenues net of interest expense increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines discount revenue our largest revenue line increased percent yearoveryear driven primarily by growth in card member spending service fees and other revenue increased percent yearoveryear driven in part by higher travelrelated revenues net card fees grew percent yearoveryear as new card acquisitions increased and card member retention remained high due to the investments we have been making in our premium value propositions net interest income grew by percent yearoveryear primarily driven by growth in loans partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher rates card member loans grew percent yearoveryear driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business the interestbearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarteroverquarter provisions for credit losses increased primarily driven by reserve builds in the current period as compared to reserve releases in the prior period and higher net writeoffs the reserve builds in the current period reflected the strong growth in loans and changes in the macroeconomic outlook writeoff and delinquency rates remained low in the current quarter however delinquency rates modestly increased on a sequential basis card member rewards business development and card member services are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased yearoveryear primarily due to network volume growth and higher usage of travelrelated benefits card member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel operating expenses increased percent yearoveryear primarily due to higher compensation costs in the current quarter and net losses on amex ventures investments in the current period as compared to net gains in the prior period partially offset by the impact of the strengthening us dollar on our international expenses during the quarter we maintained our capital ratios within our target range and returned billion of capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth our strong performance continues to give us confidence in our business model although we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment we remain committed to executing on our strategy for building sustainable longterm growth see certain legislative regulatory

strong liquidity profile we aim to satisfy our financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by tenor and by investor base among other factors mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument tenor or investor we seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market

related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the future net interest margin associated with our liquidity resources depends on the difference between our cost of funding these resources and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of september we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to

vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for

supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by employees or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries for example as previously disclosed beginning in may we began responding to a regulatory review led by the office of the comptroller of the currency and the department of justice civil division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales in january we received a grand jury subpoena from the united states attorneys office for the eastern district of new york regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a civil investigative demand from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb seeking information on sales practices related to consumers we are cooperating with all inquiries into our sales practices and related compliance practices we continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally take disciplinary and remedial actions where appropriate and provide information regarding our reviews to our regulators including the federal reserve we do not believe these matters

and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us

well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu and uk payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu and the uk given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu or the uk broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network on august the reserve bank of india lifted the restrictions it imposed on american express banking corps ability to onboard new customers as a

surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants effective october merchants in canada other than in quebec are now permitted to surcharge card purchases up to a maximum of percent as a result of a litigation settlement with visa and mastercard surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally our card members or our business in addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the form 10k merchant litigation we continue to vigorously defend antitrust and other claims initiated by merchants see

6th eu antimoney laundering directives and preceding eu antimoney laundering directives into local laws and regulations numerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced aml
