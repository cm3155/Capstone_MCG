certain key terms and related information appearing within this form 10q effective for the first quarter of we changed the way we describe our volume metrics throughout this report where we previously used the term billed business to describe our total volumes we now use the term network volumes where we previously used the term proprietary billed business to describe transaction volumes from cards and other payment products issued by american express we now use the term billed business where we previously used the term gns billed business to describe transaction volumes from cards issued by gns partners and joint ventures we now use the term processed volumes and have now included in this category transactions associated with certain alternative payment solutions that were not previously reported in our volume metrics where we previously used the term nonterelated volume to describe spend in merchant categories other than terelated merchant categories we now use the term goods services gsrelated volume we believe that these changes provide better differentiation and descriptors for the volumes that run across the american express network prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation forwardlooking statements and nongaap measures certain of the statements in this form 10q are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of refer to the cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements section we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap however certain information included within this form 10q constitutes nongaap financial measures our calculations of nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies bank holding company american express is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserves regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment our results for the second quarter reflect an acceleration of the improvement in our core business over the last several quarters as well as continued strong credit performance we believe the steps we have taken to manage the company through the pandemic and our strategy of investing to rebuild our growth momentum are helping us make sustainable progress towards our longerterm financial objectives the pace of improvement towards prepandemic network volumes that started during the second half of last year has continued with overall spending volumes exceeding prepandemic levels in june at the same time certain international countries around the globe continue to face challenges with renewed lockdowns and travel restrictions and there remains uncertainty relating to the ongoing spread and severity of the virus to the extent that the pandemic continues to have negative impacts on economies our results will be affected the company experienced significant adverse impacts during the prior year due to the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures implemented by local and national authorities yearoveryear comparisons for the three month period reflect the peak of the pandemic impact on our business in with less of an impact for the six month period due to the prepandemic results for the first two months in the prior year worldwide network volumes for the second quarter increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis and were down percent percent on an fxadjusted basis from prepandemic levels while us network volumes increased percent versus the prior year and exceeded prepandemic levels international network volumes grew percent percent on an fxadjusted basis international volumes are recovering more slowly due to the slower pace of travel and entertainment te spending recovery from the pandemic in certain international countries combined with the historical greater reliance on te spending outside the us billed business which represented percent of our total network volumes in the second quarter of and drives most of our financial results increased percent percent on an fxadjusted basis and continued to show different recovery trends for gs and te spend gs spend which accounts for the majority of our billed business increased percent yearoveryear and continued to strengthen resulting in percent growth versus prepandemic levels this growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in consumer online and cardnotpresent spending even as offline spending recovered to prepandemic levels as well as continued strong growth in b2b spending on goods and services by small and midsized enterprise customers te spend more than tripled versus the prior year with a significant acceleration in yearoveryear growth compared to the first quarter primarily driven by us consumer card members and small and midsized enterprise customers however te spending remained well below the prepandemic levels total revenues net of interest expense were up percent yearoveryear and we had double digit growth in all of our revenue lines with the exception of net interest income which currently represents only percent of our revenues discount revenue our largest revenue line increased percent yearoveryear driven primarily by growth in card member spending and an increase in the average discount rate from higher levels of te spend in the us other fees and commissions and other revenues significantly increased yearoveryear primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues net card fees grew percent year over year as we continued to ramp up new card acquisitions and card member retention remained high net interest income declined by percent yearoveryear due to a decrease in net interest yield on average card member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances caused in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength in our customer base card member loans increased percent which was lower than the growth in billed business also due to the higher paydown rates we expect recovery in loan balances and net interest income to continue to lag the improvement in spend volumes provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit primarily due to a reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net writeoffs we do not expect to see a material increase in write off rates in the remainder of this year the reserve release in the current quarter was driven by strong credit performance and a somewhat improved macroeconomic outlook which was partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables our improved credit performance was driven by our strong risk management practices and the current record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs that are beginning to taper off the total balance of loans and receivables in our financial relief programs frp saw a significant reduction as compared to the prior quarter and the prior year however they remain higher than prepandemic levels the majority of frp balances are in twelvemonth programs and the decrease this quarter reflects card members who had enrolled at the height of the pandemic now graduating from these programs the credit performance of these balances postfrp remains uncertain the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into us dollars ie assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased yearoveryear due to growth in spend and higher usage of travelrelated benefits during the quarter we remained focused on controlling operating expenses while increasing marketing investments to continue building growth momentum we continued to increase new card acquisitions and the additional value on several of our premium products is helping to drive increased card member engagement and retention rates we expect marketing investments to be elevated for the remainder of the year our capital position remains strong with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements we are focused on getting back to our common equity tier cet riskbased capital ratio target range of to percent over the next several quarters by returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments we are increasingly optimistic that the strength in our core business through the first half of the year will continue particularly in the us although we recognize challenges still exist and the pace of recovery remains uneven in different regions of the world we remain committed to executing our investment strategy for growing our business over the long term see certain legislative regulatory and other developments and cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements for information on legislative and regulatory changes additional impacts of the covid19 pandemic and other matters that could

pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators the cecl final rules as of june our reported regulatory capital excluded the billion impact to retained earnings upon the adoption of the cecl methodology and percent of the billion decrease in reserves for credit losses from january to june we will begin phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at percent per year beginning january as a category iv firm we were not subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress tests in we were required to submit to the federal reserve our annual capital plan which we did in april on june the federal reserve confirmed our scb of percent and resulting cet1 capital ratio requirement of percent which remain unchanged from the levels announced in august failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at american express or aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express or aenb to take actions that could limit our business operations dividends and share repurchases we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the three and six months ended june we returned billion and billion respectively to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and billion respectively and share repurchases of billion and billion respectively we repurchased million in common shares at an average price of in the second quarter of in addition during the three and six months ended june we paid million and million respectively in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding for the second quarter of the federal reserve allowed bank holding companies participating in the comprehensive capital analysis and review like us to pay common stock dividends and repurchase common stock provided a the dividends and repurchases in the aggregate did not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and b the firm did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of the federal reserve also permitted stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation on june the federal reserve announced that capital distribution restrictions would be lifted beginning on july going forward our capital distributions will be governed by the scb framework and be based on managing our cet1 riskbased capital ratio within a to percent target range given the federal reserves latest guidance we plan to increase the level of share repurchases to migrate our cet1 ratio back to our target range over the next several quarters we may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods including open market purchases 10b51 plans privately negotiated transactions including employee benefit plans or other purchases including block trades accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate our decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors including our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements regulatory guidance or restrictions actual and forecasted business results economic and market conditions revisions to or revocation of the federal reserves authorization of our capital plan and the supervisory stress test process funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits our direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time and we expect that will continue summary of consolidated debt we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of june and december table summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits billions june december shortterm borrowings longterm debt total debt customer deposits total debt and customer deposits we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain

and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of june we had billion in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities which are substantially comprised of us government treasury obligations the decrease of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the increase in the balances of our card member loans and receivables debt maturities and the reduction in our retail deposits the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of june we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust as the balance of card member receivables in the charge trust fluctuates over time in line with business volumes our capacity to draw on the charge trust facility may be reduced when volumes decline on july we extended the charge trusts billion facility by two years to mature on july we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of june no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve as of june we had approximately billion in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of june of billion with a maturity date of october as of june no amounts were drawn on this facility unused credit outstanding and certain contractual obligations as of june we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection that covers losses associated with purchased goods and services see note to the

net income adjusted for i noncash items included in net income such as provisions for credit losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities primarily resulting from an increase in membership rewards liability related to growth in billed business in the net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by the significant decline in spending volumes triggered by the sharp contraction in the global economy caused by the accelerating spread of covid19 resulting in lower accounts payable to merchants and other liabilities partially offset by cash generated from net income for the period cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio in the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by net maturities of our investment securities partially offset by higher card member loan and receivable balances resulting from higher card member spending in the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by a decline in card member loan and receivable balances partially offset by net purchases of investment securities the decline in card member loan and receivable balances was due to the ongoing pay down of outstanding balances by card members combined with significant declines in spending that occurred due to the covid19 pandemic cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases in the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by net debt repayments and decreases in customer deposits combined with payments made for

growth in customer deposits other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and by governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including error or misconduct by employees or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations external publicity concerning investigations including those that are narrow in scope can increase their scope and scale and lead to further regulatory inquiries for example as previously disclosed beginning in may we began responding to a regulatory review led by the office of the comptroller of the currency and the department of justice civil division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales we also conducted an internal review of certain sales from and and have taken appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions including voluntarily providing remediation to certain current and former customers information regarding our investigation has been provided to our other regulators including the federal reserve in january we received a grand jury subpoena from the united states attorneys office for the eastern district of new york regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a civil investigative demand from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb seeking information on sales practices related to consumers we are cooperating with all of these inquiries and continue to review and enhance our controls related to our sales practices generally we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended

and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us

well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu and uk payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu and the uk given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu or the uk broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network on april the reserve bank of india imposed restrictions on the ability of american express banking corp to onboard certain customers in india from may until it complies with

statement of the interim consolidated financial statements have been made results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities these accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management but actual results could differ effective april we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in net card fees in the consolidated statements of income such costs are now recorded as incurred in marketing and business development expense this change is not material to the consolidated financial statements recently adopted accounting standards effective january we elected to change our accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method pam in accordance with the accounting guidance pam results in the amortization of the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the related tax credits and recognition of the net investment performance in the statement of income as a component of income tax provision while the equity method reflected losses related to the investments as a component of other net expenses as a result we believe pam is preferable as it better reflects the economics of our tax credit investments since the impact of this change is immaterial to our prior and current period financial statements we implemented pam on a prospective basis which resulted in a onetime charge to income tax provision of million in the first quarter of reflecting the cumulative impact of the difference in the timing of expense recognition between the equity method and pam american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited loans and card member receivables

american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited reserves for credit losses reserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period which is approximately three years beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the rs period the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recoveries for each month of the rs period beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to longterm average loss rates pd models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be writtenoff ead models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of writeoff this includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios the ead models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from card members after default occurs typically as a result of collection efforts future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions we also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions that are incorporated over the rs period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party management reviews these economic scenarios and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product gdp that are significant to our models we also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in our assessment may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves higher or lower to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models such as external conditions emerging portfolio trends the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due accounts or management risk actions lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics such as past spend and remittance behaviors credit bureau scores where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of reserves for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and within the provisions for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income rather than reversing interest income separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually using a discounted cash flow model loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and days past due for term loans loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited the following table reflects the range of

on may the california court transferred the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on august the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes vat to certain of our international transactions which are in various stages of audit or are being contested in legal actions while we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional vat in certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments we were required to pay the vat assessments prior to contesting our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings these legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims including but not limited to common law tort contract application of tax laws antitrust and consumer protection claims some of which present novel factual allegations andor unique legal theories while some matters pending against us specify the damages sought many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated the claimed amount may be exaggerated andor unsupported as a result some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery andor development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings an accrual is recorded when it is both a probable that a loss has occurred and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on a quarterly basis developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses as applicable for those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accruals related to those matters this range represents managements estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such legal proceedings evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we face exposure associated with card member purchases including with respect to the following return protection refunds the price of qualifying purchases made with eligible cards where the merchant will not accept the return for up to days from the date of purchase and merchant protection protects card members primarily against nondelivery of purchases usually in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of a merchant when this occurs the card member may dispute the transaction for which we will generally credit the card members account if we are unable to collect the amount from the merchant we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member the largest component of the exposure relates to card member transactions associated with travelrelated merchants primarily through business arrangements where we have remitted payment to such merchants for a card member travel purchase that has not yet been used or flown we have an accrual of million related to these exposures as of june to date we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and resulting containment measures a reasonably possible loss related to these exposures in excess of the recorded accrual cannot be quantified as the card member purchases that may include or result in claims are not sufficiently estimable although we believe our risk of loss has increased as a result of the covid19 pandemic american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks these instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables including interest rates and foreign exchange rates and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets these instruments enable end users to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and for that reason are an integral component of our market risk management we do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes a majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of june and december are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties accordingly where appropriate we have elected to present derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets in relation to our credit risk certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position as of june these derivatives were not in a material net liability position based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of june and

including interest accruals on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges net investment hedges we primarily designate foreign currency derivatives as net investment hedges to
