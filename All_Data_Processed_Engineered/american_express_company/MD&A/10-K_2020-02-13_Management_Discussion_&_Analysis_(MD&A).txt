merchant acquirer for facilitating transactions between the merchants and card members the amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services or merchant discount varies with among other factors the industry in which the merchant does business the merchants overall american expressrelated transaction volume the method of payment the settlement terms with the merchant the method of submission of transactions and in certain instances the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us eg domestic or global and the transaction amount in some instances an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for nonswiped card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the united states at merchants located in the united states interest on loans principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account other fees and commissions primarily represent card member

impact of a litigationrelated charge in the first quarter results included a per share impact of certain discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter nongaap measures we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap however certain information included within this report constitutes nongaap financial measures our calculations of nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies business environment our results for continued the steady consistent performance that we have delivered over the past two years these results reflect our strategy of investing in share scale and relevance and demonstrate our success in executing against our four strategic imperatives we continued to invest in new card acquisitions new services and card member benefits refreshing and launching new products and expanding our merchant network during the year we returned billion of capital to our shareholders through our share buyback program and an increase in our dividend while maintaining strong capital ratios our worldwide billed business increased percent over the prior year and worldwide proprietary billings which comprised of our total billings grew percent led by consumers after adjusting for foreign currency exchange fx rates worldwide proprietary billed business increased percent over the prior year with international proprietary billings growing percent this spending occurred against the backdrop of an economy that grew at a more modest pace relative to us consumer proprietary billed business grew at percent reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers international proprietary consumer growth remained in double digits on an fxadjusted basis we also saw percent growth from our commercial customers driven by steady acquisition and retention of us small and midsized enterprise sme customers and strong growth in international sme customers gns billed business declined percent percent on an fxadjusted basis as we exited the network business in europe and australia due to certain regulatory changes excluding the billings from those geographies gns billed business grew percent yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis revenues net of interest expense increased percent percent on an fxadjusted basis driven by a wellbalanced mix of growth in card fees card member spending and net interest income the fourth quarter of was the tenth consecutive quarter with fxadjusted revenue growth of percent or better card fees continue to be our fastest growing revenue line with an increase of percent yearoveryear reflecting our approach of enhancing the value of our premium products to drive higher customer engagement discount revenue increased percent yearoveryear primarily driven by the previously mentioned billings growth net interest income grew at percent yearoveryear driven by growth in loans and net yield reflecting continued positive impacts from mix and pricing initiatives card member loans grew percent yearoveryear as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members provisions for losses increased percent driven by a modest increase in net writeoffs which reflects the impact of our lending strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low unemployment rate spending on customer engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and business development expenses increased percent yearoveryear with growth across all categories increases in rewards and card member services reflected the growth in proprietary billings and continued investment and usage across many of our premium travelrelated benefits card member services costs continue to be our fastest growing expense category as it includes the costs of many components of our differentiated value propositions that support strong card member acquisition and engagement marketing and business development expense grew due to continued investments in our partnerships including the impact of the renewal of our relationship with delta air lines earlier in and higher corporate client incentives operating expenses increased percent yearoveryear reflecting investments we are making across our business and the litigationrelated charge in the first quarter of the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into us dollars ie assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared fxadjusted revenues and expenses constitute nongaap measures we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we continue to see attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and plan to invest to take advantage of them in order to generate and sustain a strong level of revenue growth which we believe is the foundation for steady and consistent doubledigit eps growth while we continue to see some headwinds in the environment including from economic and geopolitical uncertainty regulation in countries around the world and intense competition we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants card members and business partners and delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders see supervision and regulation in business for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and risk factors for

consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on riskadjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the us federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets the basel iii minimum

efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels at american express or aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of

other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the

broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives while we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that direct deposits such as the personal savings program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our assetliability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our global proprietary cardissuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary cardissuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes our funding plan to meet these financing needs is in turn driven by among other factors our liquidity position size and mix of business asset growth choice of funding sources and our maturing obligations funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december table summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits table start billions shortterm borrowings longterm debt total debt customer deposits total debt and customer deposits table end we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our funding plan for the full year includes among other sources approximately zero to billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately billion to billion of secured term debt issuance our annual funding plans can vary due to various risks and uncertainties such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control our equity

stable table end downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs shortterm funding programs shortterm borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interestbearing overdrafts with banks our shortterm funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of shortterm borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december we had billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of billion in commercial paper outstanding during refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital level of aenb we through aenb have a personal savings program which is our primary deposit product channel the direct retail program makes fdicinsured certificates of deposit cds and highyield savings account products available directly to consumers we also source deposits through thirdparty distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of december we had billion in customer deposits refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits longterm debt and asset securitization programs as of december we had billion in longterm debt outstanding during we and our subsidiaries issued billion of unsecured debt and assetbacked securities with maturities ranging from to years refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with costeffective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to thirdparty investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our whollyowned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our asset securitizations on february we removed us consumer and small business card member receivables from the american express issuance trust ii the charge

objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities through our us bank subsidiary aenb we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserves discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include marketwide firmspecific and combined liquidity stresses we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the level of future net interest costs to maintain these resources can be substantial as it depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately billion as of december in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december of billion with a maturity date of october the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december and we were in compliance with each of our covenants as of december no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility we may from time to time use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows table cash flows table start billions total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash net decrease increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash table end cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i noncash items included in net income such as provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower growth in card member receivables and loans partially offset by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a higher level of share repurchases and lower growth in customer deposits offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on and offbalance sheet transactions arrangements obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed

service applied our prior year us federal income tax return overpayment against a portion of the remaining obligation d the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or noncancelable minimum contractual obligations as applicable by period under contracts that were in effect as of december e as of december there were no minimum required contributions and no contributions are currently planned for the us american express retirement plan for the us american express retirement restoration plan and nonus defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in are anticipated to be approximately million and this amount has been included within other longterm liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other longterm liabilities do not include billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered longterm liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable f as of december we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a million unfunded commitment included in other longterm liabilities in addition to this amount there was a further million of contractual offbalance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement generally ranging from five to ten years such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payments we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on card members spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new card members in the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment we will pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points as of december we had billion in such commitments outstanding and also had certain cobrand arrangements that include commitments based on variables the values of which are not yet determinable and thus the amount is not quantifiable we also have offbalance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other offbalance sheet arrangements guarantees as of december we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees certain other offbalance sheet arrangements as of december we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products the maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements however based on historical experience we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure the actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended december and refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other offbalance sheet arrangements risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprisewide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief audit executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes controls talent and capabilities the board monitors the tone at the top our risk culture and oversees emerging and strategic risks the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight of our enterprisewide risk management framework processes and methodologies the risk committee approves our erm policy the erm policy governs risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite for risks including individual credit risk institutional credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk reputational risk compliance risk model risk assetliability risk strategic and business risk and foreign country risk risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance including stressed forwardlooking scenarios in addition it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits escalation triggers and assessing control programs the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks transactions and exposures the risk committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the risk appetite framework including significant risk exposures risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards our internal capital adequacy assessment process including its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar submissions and resolution planning the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors reviews and approves compliance policies which include our compliance risk tolerance statement in addition the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporatewide compliance risk management program more broadly this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process internal and external auditing including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function and the integrity of our systems of internal controls the audit and compliance committee provides oversight of our internal audit group the audit and compliance committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief audit executive and approves internal audits annual audit plan charter policies and budget the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plans status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs as well as those covering our risktaking employees appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forwardlooking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks the compensation and benefits committee uses a riskbalanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives there are several internal management committees including the enterprisewide risk management committee ermc chaired by our chief risk officer the ermc is the highestlevel management committee to oversee all firmwide risks and is responsible for risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite it maintains the enterprisewide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies companywide the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking business unit presidents our chief credit officer chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risktaking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief operational risk officer and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing market liquidity and assetliability risk capital and resolution planning our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards and term loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ermc as appropriate the individual credit risk management policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension including prospecting new account approvals pointofsale authorizations credit line management and collections the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decisionmaking models that use uptodate information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus we have developed datadriven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our gcs gms and gns businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by clientspecific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize riskadjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline and travel industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines and the travel industry more broadly including cruise lines travel agencies and tour operators our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners under risk factors for additional information debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators and d process and entitylevel risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers andor us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we have implemented an information security program and operating model that is designed to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction our information security program and operating model are based on the national institute of standards and technology cybersecurity common standards framework which consist of controls designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents the framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection response and recovery capabilities chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee a subcommittee of the ormc provides governance for our information security risk management program the information security and technology oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information cyber security and technology risk management programs see a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards under risk factors for additional information privacy and data governance our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure chaired by the chief privacy officer our privacy risk management committee a subcommittee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our privacy program the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection notice use sharing transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations rules or standards of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporatewide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed the compliance risk management committee crmc chaired by the chief compliance and ethics officer is responsible for identifying evaluating managing and escalating compliance risks the crmc has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ermc and the audit and compliance committee we have a comprehensive antimoney laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the antimoney laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products services client and partner relationships business activities and policies management and workplace culture or our response to unexpected events could cause sustained critical media coverage a decline in revenue or investment talent attrition litigation or government or regulatory scrutiny we view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service trust security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the worlds best customer experience and fundamental to our longterm success our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and interest rates on liabilities such as debt and deposits foreign exchange risk arises from transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the us dollar our assetliability management alm and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the asset liability committee or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and alm activities as well as overseeing compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments interest rate risk we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variableand fixedrate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to or from variablerate from or to fixedrate we do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payments business activities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments as of december a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately million this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelvemonth time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by basis points it is further assumed that our interestrate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelvemonth horizon generally reprice by basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates in addition to parallel rate changes our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates for example movements in prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variablerate us lending receivables and loans while libor rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices commonly referred to as basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical basis point decrease in the spread between prime and libor over the next twelve months is estimated to be million we currently have approximately billion of primebased variablerate us lending receivables and loans and billion of liborindexed debt including asset securitizations libor transition due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of libor central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of libor by the end of and the establishment of alternative reference rates we have financial instruments and commercial agreements that will be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate debt and equity instruments derivatives borrowings and other contracts we have established an enterprisewide crossfunctional initiative to identify assess and monitor risks associated with libor engage with the industry participants and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates as part of this initiative we are reviewing and updating our operational processes it systems and models for a timely transition see uncertainty relating to libor and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements under risk factors for additional information foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency crosscurrency transactions and balances from our funding activities crosscurrency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately billion were outstanding with respect to card member spending and crosscurrency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately million as of december to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our boardapproved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees foreign country risk management process foreign country risk is defined as the risk that economic social andor political conditions and events in a foreign country will adversely impact us primarily as a result of greater credit losses increased operational risk or the inability to repatriate capital we manage foreign country risk as part of the normal course of business policies and procedures establish foreign country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure driven by processes that enable the monitoring of foreign country conditions in which we have exposure critical accounting estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date in estimating these losses we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve the models take into account several factors including delinquencybased loss migration rates loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member loans and receivables refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends is not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter as of december a percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately million this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquencybased loss migration rates or recoveries or the amount of outstanding balances may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information about the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments effective january and the new credit reserving methodology known as the cecl methodology liability for membership rewards the membership rewards program is our largest cardbased rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the ultimate redemption rate urr and the weighted average cost wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point is derived from the previous months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unitspecific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units internal multiyear forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples eg earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from managements current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws in particular the tax act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense the estimates are based on our current interpretations of the tax act and may change due to additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the us treasury department or others unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a nongaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a specialpurpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as assetbacked securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables the securitized loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust collectively the trusts are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets

certain charges cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the partner is then liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partners own loyalty program credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods
