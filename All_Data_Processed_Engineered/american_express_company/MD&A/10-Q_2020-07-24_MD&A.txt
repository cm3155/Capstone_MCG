federal reserves regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment businesses and economies around the globe continued to see significant adverse impacts during the second quarter due to the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures implemented by local and national authorities during the quarter while the impact of covid19 peaked and subsequently declined in some jurisdictions leading to phased reopenings other areas have seen continuing or renewed containment measures throughout the quarter our colleague base has continued to successfully operate in a remote working environment we have worked to ensure our colleagues feel secure in their jobs and have the flexibility and resources they need to stay safe and healthy more recently we have shifted our focus to planning for the safe return of our colleagues to our offices this return will take place slowly in phases and we are implementing comprehensive safety protocols for when our buildings open to support our customers and merchants we continued to offer financial and other assistance adding product benefits to reflect todays environment and continuing to provide the high level of customer service they expect and rely on during the quarter we participated in the us paycheck protection program designed to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses we also continued to work with our strategic partners on initiatives to support our communities in june we launched our global shop small campaign which includes a commitment of over million to help support our small merchants as they begin to reopen in addition we remain committed to strengthening inclusion and diversity within our company while also increasing our support to blackowned businesses and the black community we have pledged million over the next four years to fund grants and training for us blackowned small businesses to assist in their recovery and address the challenges they face due to racial and social inequalities reflective of the broader economy and spending trends in our customer segments our billed business for the quarter was down percent versus the prior year billed business in the month of april was down percent yearoveryear followed by sequential improvement through may and june with declines of percent and percent respectively nonte spend was down percent yearoveryear in april improving to a percent decline yearoveryear in june in contrast te spend saw much larger declines down percent yearoveryear in april improving to a percent yearoveryear decline in june us billed business declined percent for the quarter versus the prior year compared with a percent decline in billed business outside the united states where te volumes make up a higher proportion of spend our proprietary consumer and commercial billed business declined by percent and percent yearoveryear respectively the decline in commercial billed business was driven by continued yearoveryear decreases in te spend by our large corporate customers which continued throughout the quarter with less pronounced billed business declines from small and medium sized corporate customers where te makes up a lower proportion of spend consumer billed business was also impacted by declines in te and offline nonte spend which was slightly offset by increased online and cardnotpresent spend at nonte merchants to the extent we continue to see significant yearoveryear declines in billed business our future results will be materially impacted revenues net of interest expense decreased percent yearoveryear with sequential moderate improvement from april to june consistent with the trend in billings discount revenue our largest revenue line decreased percent which was a larger contraction than the decline in billed business for the quarter reflecting a decrease in the average discount rate the average discount rate for the quarter declined by basis points over the prior year due to a shift in spend mix to nonte categories if the spend mix stays at the current level or if the spend mix to nonte categories increases further we would expect to see continued discount rate erosion in the third quarter we continued to see covid19 related declines in other fees and commissions and other revenues primarily due to declines in travelrelated revenues card fee revenues had strong yearoveryear growth as such revenues are slower to react to economic shifts since they are recognized over a twelvemonth period and we did not see an increase in card member attrition compared to the prior year however we also saw a modest sequential deceleration in growth rate from the first quarter as the pace of new account acquisitions slowed net interest income declined by percent yearoveryear primarily driven by lower average loans partially offset by a higher net yield as a result of the spendcentric nature of our business model card member loans and receivables declined percent and percent yearoveryear respectively due to lower billed business volumes provisions for credit losses increased primarily driven by higher reserve builds reflecting the continued deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook including unemployment and gross domestic product gdp and a shift in the mix of loans and receivables partially offset by a decline in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables during the first quarter we created a customer pandemic relief cpr program to provide shortterm support for customers impacted by covid19 enrollments in the cpr program peaked in april with billion of loans and receivables included in the program as of june only billion of balances remained in the program as the majority of the enrolled customers have become current as we wind down the program we also enhanced our longerterm financial relief programs during the quarter the balance in such longerterm programs had grown to approximately billion of loans and receivables as of june see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on troubled debt restructurings in addition as of june we had billion of delinquent loans and receivables which included those balances in the cpr and other financial relief programs that were delinquent the balance of delinquent loans and receivables remained relatively constant throughout the quarter card member rewards and services and business development expenses are generally correlated to billings or are variable based on usage and were impacted this quarter by the decline in billing volumes and lower usage of travelrelated benefits due to ongoing impacts of covid19 and the resulting containment measures we expect the trend for these expenses to continue to be correlated to billings and usage in addition we continued to focus on controlling operating expenses and reducing spend on proactive marketing for new acquisitions while continuing to invest in new initiatives that enhance and provide relevant product benefits for our card members during the second quarter we substantially enhanced our liquidity levels and we further strengthened our capital position with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements these robust capital and liquidity levels provide us with significant flexibility to maintain the strength of our balance sheet through this uncertain period we also intend to maintain our quarterly dividend for the third quarter in line with prior quarters subject to approval by the board of directors looking ahead there remains great uncertainty on how the covid19 pandemic will progress or what its continued impact will be on the global economy we will continue to focus on what we can control backing our customers colleagues and communities and maintaining a tight rein on expenses while pursuing opportunities to invest in initiatives that can enable our longterm growth see certain legislative regulatory and other developments and risk factors for information on additional impacts of covid19 and related containment efforts as well as other matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition critical accounting estimates please see the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a full description of all of our critical accounting estimates the critical accounting estimate related to reserves for card member credit losses presented below has been updated to reflect the adoption of the current expected credit loss cecl methodology reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that include a significant amount of judgment primarily related to the determination of the appropriate rs period the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions and the determination of the probability of and exposure at default all of which are ultimately used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to calculate the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses on card member loans and receivables the rs period which is approximately years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions we obtain our forecasts of future economic conditions from an independent third party and in determining the relevant rs period for card member loans and receivables we also consider information arising from other internal processes as well as our own past loss experience card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff within the rs period within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment would then be allocated to the remaining balance as noted above cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple economic scenarios eg baseline better and worse obtained from an independent third party the expected credit losses calculated from each economic scenario are weighted to reflect uncertainty around the baseline economic scenario we determine the weighting of each scenario based on our detailed review of the externally sourced information and comparing other economic information we use throughout other processes macroeconomic sensitivity reserves for credit losses are sensitive to various inputs and assumptions which may differ by portfolio macroeconomic forecasts are critical inputs into our models and inherently contain multiple variables of which the us unemployment rate and us gdp growth rate are the most significant to our estimated expected credit losses at both march and june our weighted economic scenarios obtained from an independent third party assumed the us unemployment rate and contraction in us gdp would peak during the second quarter of the following table reflects the macroeconomic forecasts for those key variables utilized for the computation of reserves for credit losses as of june and march as of june as of march us unemployment rate second quarter of peak fourth quarter of us gdp growth contraction a second quarter of peak fourth quarter of a real gdp quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates the combination of the material movements in these variables contributed to a build to our reserves for credit losses of billion which was partially offset by other factors primarily a decrease in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables these macroeconomic forecasts under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates could result in significantly different changes in reserves for credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall reserves for credit losses and current results may not reflect the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes refer to the business environment and table in mda and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the impact of cecl both at implementation and for the three and six months ended june the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results of operations provide commentary on the variances for the three

environment which contains further information on covid19 and the related impacts on our results as a result of the adoption of cecl on january there is a lack of comparability in both the reserves

primarily driven by increases in our premium card product portfolios card fees which are recognized over a twelvemonth period are slower to react to economic shifts and there was no increase in card

bans and restrictions which resulted in lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased crossborder card member spending and lower travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business as well as a decline in late fees due to waived charges for card members who are enrolled in covid19 related financial relief programs other revenues decreased for both the three and six

acquisitions partially offset by incremental investments in enhancements to our card member value proposition the decrease in business development expense was driven by decreases in corporate client incentives and network partner payments due to lower billed business reflecting the impacts of covid19 partially offset by the delta changes described above card member rewards expense decreased for

minimum capital levels at american express or aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express or aenb to take actions

options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are definitions for our regulatory riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance riskweighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a

minimum projected common equity tier capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenario plus ii one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets on june the federal reserve released the results of its supervisory stress tests for all banking organizations participating in comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and aggregate results of a sensitivity analysis conducted under three alternative downside scenarios stemming from the recent covid19 pandemic our preliminary scb requirement of percent will result in a minimum common equity tier capital ratio of percent effective on october subject to confirmation of our final scb by the federal reserve we continue to support our strategy of maintaining a strong and flexible capital profile while considering expectations from all stakeholders including rating agencies in light of covid19 and its impact on the economy the federal reserve is requiring all banking organizations participating in ccar including us to resubmit capital plans in the fourth quarter based on additional economic scenarios to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook share repurchases and dividends we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the three and six months ended june we returned billion and billion respectively to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and billion respectively and share repurchases of nil and billion respectively due to the current level of uncertainty in the business environment we have suspended share repurchases since march to maintain our financial strength in addition during the three and six months ended june we paid million and million respectively in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding our decisions on capital distributions will depend on various factors including our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements including the scb effective october actual and forecasted business results economic and market conditions revisions to or revocation of the federal reserves authorization of our capital plan and the ccar process the federal reserve announced it is prohibiting share repurchases by all banking organizations participating in ccar and will require them to limit their common stock dividends to the lesser of a their common stock dividends last quarter and b the average of their net income for the four preceding calendar quarters these restrictions will continue at least through september and could be extended or further modified by the federal reserve for the third quarter of we intend to maintain our current quarterly dividend of  per common share subject to approval by our board of directors funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility while we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that direct deposits such as the personal savings program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time given the significant reductions in our business volumes and changes in growth outlook we do not currently expect to have meaningful unsecured or secured term debt issuances for the remainder of

program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of june we had cash and cash equivalents of billion the increase of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the decline in the balances of our card member loans and receivables the net interest expense to maintain these liquidity resources depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields as the amount of our liquidity resources has increased the level of future net interest expense to maintain these resources is expected to be significant as the investment income is less than the cost of funding securitized borrowing capacity as of june we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust as the balance of card member receivables in the charge trust fluctuates over time in line with business volumes our capacity to draw on the charge trust facility may be reduced when volumes decline we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of june no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately billion as of june in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of june of billion with a maturity date of october as of june no amounts were drawn on this facility unused credit outstanding and certain contractual obligations as of june we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card

depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the decrease in net cash from operating activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by the significant decline in billed business resulting in lower accounts payable and other liabilities and purchases of loyalty program points from certain of our cobrand partners which resulted in an increase in other assets these purchases of cobrand loyalty program points during the second quarter of related to the prepurchase of billion of hilton honors points as part of a preexisting contractual agreement and the payment of million for

rewards and incentive programs cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash provided by investing activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by a decline in the balances outstanding from card member loans and receivables as card members continued to pay down outstanding balances combined with a significant decline in card member spending during the period due to the continued impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures partially offset by a net increase in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the increase in net cash used in financing activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by higher net repayment of debt partially offset by higher growth in customer deposits other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations an increasing range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased

the adverse effects on the economy in the united states this has included the enactment of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and a number of emergency lending and liquidity facilities established by the federal reserve among other things the cares act created a new loan guarantee program in which we participated called the paycheck protection program designed

under us gaap for loan modifications related to covid19 that would otherwise be treated as troubled debt restructurings and ii any determination that a loan modified as a result of covid19 is a troubled debt restructuring including impairment for accounting purposes there have also been various governmental actions taken or proposed to provide forms of relief such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees governmental actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic have not always been coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have been expanding in scope and intensity the efficacy and ultimate effect of these actions is not known we continue to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to covid19 and their potential impact on our operations payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network for more information on payments regulation as well as the

previously writtenoff loans and receivables the enrollment in and effectiveness of hardship programs and troubled debt restructurings and governmental actions that provide forms of relief with respect to certain loans and fees such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions modifications or forbearance the amount of loans and receivables outstanding being higher or

reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally

contingent assets and liabilities these accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management but actual results could differ we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of june or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value as of june we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation recently adopted accounting standards effective january we adopted the new credit reserving methodology applicable to certain financial instruments known as the current expected credit loss cecl methodology under a modified

material changes to our business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance refer to note for additional information on how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the cecl methodology in addition for availableforsale debt securities the new methodology replaces the otherthantemporary impairment model and requires the recognition of an

consolidated financial statements unaudited impaired loans and receivables impaired loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the customer agreement we consider impaired loans and receivables to include i loans over days past due still accruing interest ii nonaccrual loans and iii loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs in instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty we may modify through various financial relief programs loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief we have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as tdrs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a tdr with such accounts identified as out of program tdrs such modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include i temporary interest rate reductions possibly as low as zero percent in which case the loan is characterized as nonaccrual in our tdr disclosures ii placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed months and iii suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program upon entering the modification program the customers ability to make future purchases is either limited canceled or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program in accordance with the modification agreement with the customer loans andor receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms including the contractual interest rate where applicable when the customer exits the modification program which is i when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or ii when the customer defaults out of the modification program reserves for modifications deemed tdrs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model all changes in the impairment measurement are included within provisions for credit losses in response to the covid19 pandemic the united states introduced the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which among other things provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend i certain requirements under us gaap for loan modifications related to covid19 that would otherwise be treated as tdrs and ii any determination that a loan modified as a result of covid19 is a tdr including impairment for accounting purposes based on the nature of our programs we have not elected the accounting and reporting relief afforded by this guidance and continue to report modifications as tdrs in the first quarter of we created a customer pandemic relief program for customers who have been impacted by covid19 to provide a concession in the form of payment deferrals and waivers of certain fees and interest we assessed the customer pandemic relief program and determined that eligible loan modifications were temporary in nature for example less than three months and not considered tdrs once customers exit the customer pandemic relief program they revert to their original agreement and repay outstanding balances or if they continue to face financial difficulties they can enroll in a financial relief program in which case they are reported as an in program tdr impaired card member

statements unaudited reserves for credit losses reserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to calculate a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the rs period the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recoveries for each month of the rs period beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates pd models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be writtenoff ead models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of writeoff this includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios the ead models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from card members after default occurs typically as a result of collection efforts future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions we also consider the likelihood a previously written off account will be recovered this calculation is dependent on how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions which estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and reviewed by management these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain geographic based variables that are influential to our modelling process including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product the process of estimating credit reserves incorporates the above factors over the rs period explicitly considering macroeconomic forwardlooking information additionally we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models such as external factors portfolio trends or management risk actions lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics such as past spend and remittance behaviors credit bureau scores where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of reserves for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and within the provisions for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income rather than reversing interest income separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually using a discounted cash flow model see note for information on troubled debt restructurings loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and days past due for term loans loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon

asset securitizations we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts american express credit account master trust the lending trust and american express issuance trust ii the charge trust and together with the lending trust the trusts the trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to thirdparty investors the trusts are considered vies as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying card member loans and receivables we perform the servicing and key decision making for the trusts and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance which are the collection of the underlying card member loans and receivables in addition we hold all of the variable interests in both trusts with the exception of the debt securities issued to thirdparty investors as of june and december our ownership of variable interests was billion and billion respectively for the lending trust and

properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below a putative merchant class action in the eastern district of new york consolidated in and collectively captioned in re american express antisteering rules antitrust litigation ii alleged that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants from differentially surcharging our cards or steering a customer to use another networks card or another type of generalpurpose card antisteering and nondiscrimination contractual provisions violate us antitrust laws on january our motion to compel arbitration of claims brought by merchants who accept american express and to dismiss claims of merchants who do not was granted plaintiffs have appealed part of this decision on february we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the superior court of california los angeles county captioned laurelwood cleaners llc v american express co et al in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction prohibiting american express from enforcing its antisteering and nondiscrimination provisions and from requiring merchants to offer the service of amexcard acceptance for free we intend to vigorously defend the case in july we were named as a defendant in another putative class action filed in the southern district of new york and subsequently transferred to the eastern district of new york captioned the marcus corporation v american express co et al in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws the plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages on march plaintiffs br supermarket inc dba milams market and grove liquors llc on behalf of themselves and others filed a suit captioned br supermarket inc dba milams market et al v visa inc et al for violations of the

filed on july on september the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept american express cards and on may the california court transferred the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes vat to certain of our international transactions which are in various stages of audit or are being contested in legal actions while we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional vat in certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments we were required to pay the vat assessments prior to contesting american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings these legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims including but not limited to common law tort contract application of tax laws antitrust and consumer protection claims some of which present novel factual allegations andor unique legal theories while some matters pending against us specify the damages sought many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated the claimed amount may be exaggerated andor unsupported as a result some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery andor development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings an accrual is recorded when it is both a probable that a loss has occurred and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on a quarterly basis developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses as applicable for those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accruals related to those matters this range represents managements estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such legal proceedings evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face exposure associated with card member purchases of goods and services including with respect to the following return protection refunds the price of qualifying purchases made with eligible cards where the merchant will not accept the return for up to days from the date of purchase and merchant protection protects card members primarily against nondelivery of goods and services usually in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of a merchant when this occurs the card member may dispute the transaction for which we will generally credit the card members account if we are unable to collect the amount from the merchant we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member the largest component of the exposure relates to card member transactions associated with travelrelated merchants primarily through business arrangements where we have remitted payment to such merchants for a card member travel purchase that has not yet been used or flown we have recorded an accrual of million related to these exposures as of june to date we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and resulting containment measures a reasonable possible loss related to these exposures in excess of the recorded accrual cannot be quantified as the card member purchases that may include or result in claims are not sufficiently estimable although we believe our risk of loss has increased in the current environment american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks these instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables including interest rates foreign exchange rates and an equity index or price and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets these instruments enable end users to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and for that reason are an integral component of our market risk management we do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes in relation to our credit risk certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position as of june these derivatives were not in a significant net liability position based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of june and december no credit risk adjustment
