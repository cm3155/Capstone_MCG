turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian good morning and belated happy new year to everyone and hope you and your families are healthy and safe as you saw we earned per share on billion in revenues in the fourth quarter and while were still seeing the impacts of the covid pandemic on our business the trends have steadily improved as the year went on at the beginning of the pandemic we had little visibility into the future but we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty focusing on four priorities supporting our colleagues protecting our customers and our brand remaining financially strong and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer term growth weve made substantial progress against each of these priorities as i talked about last quarter we see this cycle playing out in three phases phase one has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty which is what we focused on for most of we are now solidly in phase two which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum our goal in phase two is to prepare us for phase three a return to precovid levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm our progress in managing through phase one confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model key elements of this model such as the diversity and scale of our customer base our brand our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 as weve seen throughout this period our customers have been resilient and adaptive since the lows in mid april overall card member spending has steadily improved our card members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and cardnotpresent spending nonte spending recovered to precovid levels in  and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in  consumer holiday spending was up globally yearoveryear exhibiting particularly strong online growth of in addition our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers attrition rates on our proprietary products remain lower than last year and our customer satisfaction levels remain above precovid levels we again ranked number one in jd powers annual credit card satisfaction study of us consumers for the tenth time in the years the study has been conducted throughout the year our merchant network continued to grow globally we sustained virtual parity coverage in the united states and we added more than million merchant locations internationally in credit performance continued to be outstanding thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities and the quick adjustments weve made as the pandemic hit our  delinquencies and writeoffs are at some of the lowest levels weve seen in a few years and are best in class our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period and our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic which has been brought to their lives at work and at home all in all i feel good about all that we accomplished in and some of the highlights of which you can see on slide i am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward that being said the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the shortterm the pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed for us the timing of how quickly we can get to phase three and return to prepandemic levels of earnings is also tied to recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending and therefore dependent on how soon lockdowns ease travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again we continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to precovid levels we just cant predict right now how quickly given this environment we are looking at as a transition year during which our focus will be on rebuilding growth momentum by rebuilding growth momentum we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines scaling key next horizon opportunities and retaining the flexibility in our financial model to accomplish this we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following in our consumer and commercial businesses we plan to continue to ramp up our card member acquisition activities inject additional value into targeted products and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products additionally in our commercial business we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card a few examples of how were doing this include the work already underway to integrate and relaunch kabbages suite of products including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our ap automation solutions where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone on the network side we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally were also investing in enhancements to our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in china american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 finally we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses the nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features services and experiences we rolled out in and over the past several years and we think these trends are here to stay at a high level those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future before i hand the call over to jeff let me end with a few words about how were thinking about our financial performance in and beyond on last quarters earnings call i talked about how my confidence in the long term was growing though the nearterm remained harder to predict today im even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and longterm though im still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in as i discussed our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum with this in mind we will not be focused on a particular eps target in though jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes in reflecting on covids impact on the economy and our business in and where we are as we begin we look at this twoyear period as a pause in the growth momentum we had been generating for the previous ten consecutive quarters before the pandemic began as a result we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original eps expectations we had for in and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward i believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration the foundation of our business is solid our brand customer relationships and partnerships are strong our colleagues are focused and committed and we have shown that we can adapt to rapidly changing conditions ill now hand the call over to jeff to review our financial results and then well take your questions after that thank you for your time jeffrey c campbell chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone today ill discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year ill also provide you a sense of how we are thinking about the future with some scenarios and potential outcomes for lets get right into our summary financials on slide our results in the fourth quarter continued to improve sequentially but were still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world fourth quarter revenues of billion were down yearover year driven by declines in spend lend and other travelrelated revenues while card fee revenues continued to grow net income was billion and earnings per share was in the fourth quarter down from a year ago now as ive said over the past threequarters the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends so ill again spend the most time on these two topics turning to the details of our volumes first lets start with billed business which you will see several views of on slides through the rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since september and so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our billed business slide since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful due to the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays starting with slide overall billed business declined yearoveryear in the fourth quarter our proprietary billed business which makes up of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was down that same and the remaining of our overall billings which comes from our network business gns was down in the fourth quarter all on an fxadjusted basis american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 when you look at our billed business performance in and think about what this might mean for its important to think about te spending and nonte spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends as you can see on slide nonte spending which has long been the majority of our volumes hit a trough in the second quarter but was back above prepandemic levels by the third quarter and grew yearoveryear in the fourth quarter as our card members particularly consumers and smes have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment te spending on the other hand has remained down much more significantly declining yearoveryear in the fourth quarter though it did show some continued modest sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers as a reminder prior to the pandemic nonte spending was around of our proprietary billed business and today it represents almost as you can see on slide looking at the billings mix by customer type at the bottom of the slide you see that the majority of our te spending has historically come from our consumer business and that is even more true today taking a closer look at te on slide you see the consumer te continued to recover faster than that of smes and large corporations we expect this trend to continue given the pentup demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations that corporations particularly large ones will continue to limit their te spending for some time you also continued to see different paces of recovery within the categories of te cruises which are a very small part of our business have been slower to recover followed by the airlines though both showed modest improvement sequentially in  restaurant spending on the other hand has been the most resilient throughout decelerated slightly during  due to colder weather in the us and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies moving on to global consumer on slide we continued to see an acceleration in online and cardnotpresent spend growth throughout especially during the holiday season which drove growth in nonte spending in the fourth quarter turning next to our global commercial billed business on slide nonte spending has returned to precovid levels and grew yearoveryear in the fourth quarter within our commercial segment you continue to see a tale of two very different customer types spending from small and mediumsized enterprise customers who historically have the highest mix of nonte spending has been the most resilient throughout whereas large and global corporate card spending which historically has been primarily te has been down the most during the pandemic i will remind you here that spending from our sme customers now represents of our commercial billed business you also see the impact of different mixes of te spend when you look at our international regions on slide which have more travelrelated spending historically and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume more generally it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic to sum up on volumes we feel good about the pace of recovery in nonte spending throughout and expect it will continue to grow steadily in but more broadly in our overall volume recovery to pre pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with te since nonte has already substantially recovered while we currently expect spending in  to remain relatively in line with  of outside of some impact from normal seasonality our current assumption is that by  of te spending will have recovered to around of  levels moving next to loans and receivables on slide loan and receivable balances were up and sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays however loan and receivable volumes were down and yearoveryear respectively in the fourth quarter driven by american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 the continued declines in spending volumes that i just spoke about we also continued to see higher paydown rates from revolving card members on our credit cards looking forward into i would expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes if the higher paydown rate trends we saw in continue in addition id remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year due to seasonal spending patterns turning next to our traditional credit metrics on slide you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with card member loans and receivable writeoff dollars excluding gcp down and yearoveryear respectively in addition our writeoff and delinquency rates continued to be down year overyear and down sequentially in the fourth quarter reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates weve seen in several years for both card member loans and receivables looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on slide those balances continued to decline sequentially to billion at the end of  and now stand billion higher than they were prepandemic historically the credit outcomes of card members that are enrolled in those programs are better than delinquent card members that do not with around of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in frp have been in line with our historical experience it is unusual to see credit performance this strong in an environment like this it all starts with the changes weve made over the last few years in our risk management practices which gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance of course like others our customers are also helped by external factors such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs as a result we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery and that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves moving on to slide you will see that the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in the modeling of cecl reserves for the expected lifetime losses for the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenario since  but the two scenarios do remain sharply divergent in our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter we continued to weigh heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that i just spoke about despite this caution the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions in our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release million of reserves in the fourth quarter as you can see on slide this reserve release coupled with our low writeoffs drove a provision expense benefit of million in the fourth quarter we ended the year with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances of our card member receivables balances respectively and we believe that the reserves on our balance sheet which are up billion from the prepandemic levels are appropriate given the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery turning now to the details of our revenue performance on slide fourth quarter revenues were down year overyear driven by declines in spend lend and other travelrelated revenues while net card fees continued to grow as you can see on slide net card fee growth remained strong throughout and grew in the fourth quarter demonstrating the impact of the continued card member engagement that steve discussed but growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter and will continue to increase investments in this area this year it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate as a result i do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on slide net interest income declined on an fx adjusted basis roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter net interest yield on our card members loans increased basis points yearoveryear in the third quarter driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances looking forward id expect net interest income to be relatively flat to  in the first quarter and then increase modestly as the loan volumes recover turning next to our largest component of revenue discount revenue on slide as expected the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in te and nonte billings trends this difference drove an 11basispoint decline in the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since as a reminder we on average earn higher discount rates with te merchants versus nonte merchants the discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter looking forward into id expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of te recovery coming back to total revenues on slide you see that the overall revenue trends in have broadly moved in line with billed business trends given the spendcentric nature of our business model while i would expect first quarter revenues to be broadly in line with  outside of some impact from seasonality if te spending recovers to around of levels by  as i mentioned earlier youd probably see overall revenue growth of around to for full year and if te recovers more slowly or quickly you would see full year revenue growth thats somewhat lower or higher than that to moving on to slide were continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and opex which are driven by management decisions variable customer engagement expenses in total were down for the full year driven by lower spending and lower usage of travelrelated benefits the yearoveryear declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a offset to the fullyear revenue declines we saw in in the fourth quarter that offset was closer to as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travelrelated benefits and i would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of moving on to the marketing expense line we invested billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection as steve mentioned in our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so as a result we could spend as much as a little over billion in marketing this year our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions turning to operating expenses you can see that they were down yearoveryear in as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our longterm strategies in we expect our operating expenses to be around billion below levels as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum last while you saw some american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 quarterly volatility this year on our effective tax rate the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below and id expect around a effective tax rate in absent any legislative changes turning next to capital and liquidity on slide our capital and liquidity positions remained tremendously strong as they have been all year our cet1 ratio ended the year at after hitting in the third quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio and our cash and investment balance ended the year at billion and has been a record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet we remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty looking forward we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our longterm cet1 target ratio of to we plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum fed authorized capacity of around million in  beyond  our capital distributions will be a function of the feds guidelines our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet to sum up we feel good about how weve navigated through the unprecedented challenges of and we feel well positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in we now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment the two areas that do remain harder to predict for though are the same two we have talked about since the pandemic began the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in te spending as i mentioned earlier that said the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in and so on slide we have outlined two scenarios most importantly scenario one assumes that the caution we have shown in our  credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a te recovery by  and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery the combination of these things could lead to an eps outcome as low as around scenario two most importantly assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves this sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery the combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger eps outcome in the area of in either scenario our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts not by focusing on a specific eps outcome we run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the longterm although we cant predict precisely where eps will land or provide an eps guidance range at this time we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original eps expectations we had for in and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 and with that the operator will now open up the lines for questions operator question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw go ahead please sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i appreciate it jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hi sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc how are you i appreciate all the context for and because i know its pretty fluid but i guess as we think about the assumptions youve outlined how confident are you on the te rebound in the fourth quarter i mean do you need a broadscale reopening or do you think just naturally the behaviors will be better this year versus last year when we were in shock kind of postcovid and then im just wondering how much of an uptake are you assuming from the new customer acquisitions that started last quarter could that be additive to your guidance and then last one on the assumptions just the reserve releases like how much of that are you assuming in your number in this year versus thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co okay well try those three questions sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its all around one theme though stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah yeah well the first thing i will say is there was no real guidance i mean we gave sort of some scenarios but lets talk about the first part of the string here and then i think jeff can jump in at the end with the releases but were in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year i mean when we were talking last year at any given point in time we didnt have a vaccine and so while the vaccine right now is what i would call its fits and starts i mean is there enough at the beginning there wasnt enough places to sort of just to do vaccine distribution now they have vaccine distribution points but you dont have enough vaccine to distribute hard to get appointments so theres a lot of disconnect that will sort itself out and it will sort itself out over a period of a couple months not over a couple years american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 and so we believe that by june or so you will either have sort of a herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity the other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pentup demand for travel and nobody on this call that doesnt want to travel or go someplace or dont know their friends or family that want to do the same thing and so when we look at it i dont think youll see a widespread international travel but you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being domestic travel here in the united states domestic travel sort of within the european union things like that youre probably not going to see a lot of long haul this year and so look im fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel i mean were talking about consumer travel potentially being back about with overall travel being back about business travel will come back a little bit slower but id be shocked if were sitting here at this time next year and we say jeez we really missed it on travel i just dont see that happening i have a lot of confidence in the vaccines but again these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace i mean what do you have like million people in the united states at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that and its only january and so i believe that as we get into this summer season theres june july august and september you will see a rush for people to travel especially air travel i think cruise lines thats more of a phenomenon so we feel really good about consumer travel coming back i think our airline partner with delta ed said the same thing on his earnings call so we feel real confident about that and as far as new cards i mean look new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix but what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast not the scenarios is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because youre not going to have those card members traveling right out of the gate theyll probably be more of a second half phenomenon and so their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal having said that were really focused on getting we dont talk a lot about cards but cards lead to billed business acquired which we do talk a lot about we are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine and we believe there are a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co sanjay ill add two things on cards and then talk about reserves i would point out on cards we were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the us consumer business our platinum and gold new card member acquisition numbers were essentially at levels thats a really good sign to us the other point id make just to reiterate what steve said is that its really a impact to a great extent is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers it wont affect the results that much because the results then to go to your last question are all about what happens with credit and i guess id encourage everyone to think about two numbers so i cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year we now end the year with billion more in credit reserves we also relative to the beginning of the year ended the year with billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs and yet i also pointed out that historically of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs we end up collecting and doing fine with so what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook and so you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy small businesses going bankrupt lots of consumers being laid off you have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 so were not making an economic call sanjay were saying well if all that bad stuff happens like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast then were going to need all those reserves we have on the books and probably thats sort of where the low scenario comes from conversely if while rocky theres a fairly steady recovery we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario so well have to see but either way our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year because its all about operator our next question will go to the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so this question i had was around your proprietary card acquisition trends which you put in the deck and i just wanted to get an understanding as to which programs are you seeing drive this kind of stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co betsy operator operator ms graseck your line is still open please check your mute feature jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well should we just go ahead and answer what we think betsy was in the middle of asking steve stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co around new card acquisitions stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and i think jeff just really answered it i mean when we look at new card acquisition our platinum and our gold levels are were at levels of and so we feel really good about that i think our cashback cards american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 were actually doing quite well as well what we have not seen and this makes all the sense in the world is our cobrand acquisition and our cobrand acquisition look the reason you do cobrand cards you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners but you also get tremendous distribution and right now not a lot of people staying at hotels not a lot of people taking flights so you lose those distribution opportunities having said that what our cobrand cards though are performing either in the united states or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective because as ive said all along people spend to gather those points to take those trips because they have such a pentup demand for travel and our retention numbers on our cobrand cards are at the same levels they were in so we feel good about proprietary acquisition which again is being driven by platinum and gold and some cash back our cobrand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our the cobrand channels but having said that our cobrand performance is really really good and ed made that comment ed bastian made that comment in his earnings remarks as well so hopefully betsy weve provided a little bit of somewhere around the answer you answered the question you were trying to ask before you got cut off operator our next question will come from the line of mark devries of barclays go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks had some questions about the scenarios just clarifying the scenario the scenario two essentially jeff all the things you outlined for your expectations such as the rebound in te spend and the or the to revenue growth and everything from marketing and opex as well as benign credit and then second part of that is just aspiration kind of what do you guys need to see to get there jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well maybe ill take the first part steve and you should take the second so on mark i guess the point is the overwhelming driver of a low scenario or a high scenario are what happens or is going to be what happens with credit as i said a few minutes ago now sure if credit turns out to be really strong your revenue is going to be a little on the strong side and vice versa but what were trying to do if you go throughout my remarks is give you a very clear sense of how were going to manage the company this year and thats why i told you what we were going to manage opex to and what we might spend on marketing and were going to do those things because were all about rebuilding growth momentum this year the ultimate credit outcome and just how quickly discount revenues come back is going to be driven by the external environment and thats why you have a low and a high scenario but it really is not going to impact how we run the company this year which of those two scenarios comes out so thats what were trying to communicate by calling these scenarios as opposed to a guidance range and then steve maybe you want to talk about american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah look i think two top line assumptions you have consumer te fully recovered and you have a reasonably healthy economy in so were not expecting corporate travel to come back i dont think thats going to be a driver of it and so if you have that as your baseline then i think were right within where we want to be and the key thing that we need to do is and weve said this as we went through both our remarks our investment levels will be higher than theyve ever been thats our plan we are planning provided we have and we have light to we see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of investment opportunities we will continue to invest and take advantage of all those investment opportunities that are available to us if theyre not there well pull back but we believe they will be there we will look to ramp up our card acquisition we will look at value injection early on in the year well look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year were going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the united states were going to drive really hard at international acceptance i mean look we signed million merchants internationally last year not including china take china off the table for a second but were going to drive international acceptance as weve said were going to continue to work and invest in our network were going to launch kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers and were going to get some traction in china as well so we are really focused in in investing across all dimensions of our each one of our business lines and preparing ourselves for by building that strong foundation of retaining card members acquiring new ones and building that merchant network and continuing to build up network capabilities and digital capabilities we believe with a healthy economy and te consumer spending just about fully recovered well be within our range operator well go next to line of rick shane with jpmorgan go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning id like to start with a question about nonmarketing non rewards expense in  that was literally the only line item thats comparable to levels im curious if you think that theres going to be better opportunity for operating leverage on that metric and what sort of drove the normal rate there versus everything else you saw in the business stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well let me rick take it up one level and then come back if you dont think this is responsive i mean what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing and we have a very clear plan in to manage those to about billion that is below levels if you were to look at some businesses we sold over the years its frankly about where the number was a decade ago in and so we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what i think of as the infrastructure costs of the company which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow theres tremendous leverage from holding that a little below levels theres always a little bit of quarterly noise american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 particularly the  some of the lines in opex youll see every year if you go back and look at history go up a little bit but thats the disciplined approach that were taking here so i dont know if i got to the nub of your question rick but thats probably how we think about it jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co yeah the other thing i would add is that if you look at this number on the face of it its pretty much the same number weve had in from an operating expense perspective but yet the business is very different than it was in were focused on different things weve acquired a bunch of companies which are in here and our focus has been completely different so i think the team has done a really good job of on an ongoing basis taking expense out and then putting investment back in and so as you think about this what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base and the way we look at it thats providing us leverage so if we think about the core business that we had were getting enough leverage out of that to fund other opportunities within the business whether that be kabbage whether that be the acquisition of a mezi or a resy or a loungebuddy so forth and so on and yet you go back years were at the same place and so we believe when we look at it as managers of the business were getting tremendous operating leverage because were able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating costs and thats how we look at it operator well go next to the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning jeff good morning steve stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe a twopart question so steve you noted in your color that for you expect te to be on the consumer side to be fully recovered and a healthy economy so maybe first can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending you outlined opex and marketing this year could be billion will there be a pullback in spending or could we see revenues accelerating as card member growth picks up and then secondly you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below precovid levels were in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pentup demand like myself but cant leverage anything in the near term so can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 how youre thinking about product refreshes and does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of whats included in the value proposition thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i think lets talk about the second one first and if i remember the first question ill come back to it it seemed like a couple of minutes ago im just teasing you ryan but when we look at sort of value injection i think because people couldnt travel what we tried to do was to do two things to not only provide them value in the short term but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card and so when you look at what we did with platinum and with open platinum and centurion by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits we had of our us platinum card members take advantage of those of that value injection we had about of our small business customers take advantage of that but the really interesting point in consumer platinum of our base was not putting wireless on their card they are now so we had an uptick of now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have and so for the first time of our platinum card base actually put wireless on the card which is you might think surprising but people put spending in compartments and put streaming on the card so the value injection is meant for us to do two things number one steer people where we want them to go and number two provide real value to them and we did that and i think that that has really helped us from a retention perspective because obviously people want value well continue to do that and then well look at our overall value propositions just as weve had over the course of the last three years and continue to refresh those and i think youll see those refreshed and well expand the aperture of that so you will expand beyond traditional te value proposition enhancements well look at other te value proposition enhancements because safety and traveling will become even more important i think to our premium cardholders and well work with our partners a lot of the value we put in is either cofunded or merchant funded and well continue to work with our partners to do that so we feel really good about the retention that we saw and we feel really good about the value injection because of the behavioral shift that it drove and we believe that that will be sticky which is why you see an increase in our nonte spending on a sequential basis and we believe that will continue so thats the first part as far as the second part of the question look we do believe that the first question was we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pentup demand i see the vaccine is working we see herd immunity coming and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter if god forbid the vaccines efficacy proves it doesnt work weve got a whole different issue for the entire economy and were not talking about american express traveling were talking about different things at this particular point but all indications are vaccine will work it will be distributed and off well go as far as corporate spending look our corporate card business which is near and dear to all of us drives about of our overall billings and about of that is te there are companies that are still traveling and the te piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines its across lodging its across restaurants its across car rental and its across air as well and so we have pharmaceutical sales reps that travel by car they stay in hotels and they spend food thats still going on where you see not a lot of te spending is consultants who american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 cannot go actually to their clients but when you think about industrials and manufacturing that is still going on and you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts but having said that we dont anticipate that coming back but we dont believe thats a big driver of our overall profitability as weve said its not a big driver of our revenue that billings does not equate to either revenue or profitability and we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our corporate card business jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co and id just add two other things ryan sort of the other leg of the stool is small business where travel just isnt that big a piece of their spending and those small businesses are already going strong and we just need them to continue a steady recovery the other thing i just want to clarify for everyone is reminding you that when we went into months ago on a january call it seems like years ago we gave you guidance for of to and thats the kind of target that were aspiring to achieve in operator our next question will come from the line of chris donat with piper sandler go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my question in terms of the merchant discount rate jeff you said that it would depend on the te spending im just wondering where we are taking a longer term view on optblue and some of the downward pressure youve seen on the mdr in recent years are we basically through that and can we expect maybe the more likely scenarios that you see an increase in mdrs you see more te spend or is there any downside risk to the jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co so two things were completely through any downward pressure from optblue thats in the rearview mirror and obviously if you look at whats happened at discount rate discount rate has been driven down by mix and its like ive always said i always focus on discount rate by industry and mix overall because if you look at sort of where we are right now at or i think thats where we are right now is you say oh my god youre at but youre at with te decline and so as te comes back that mdr will move back up but optblue will not have any pressure at all on that discount rate so we expect as te moves up overall overall discount rate will go up but having said that if nonte winds up going through the roof and that puts pressure on mdr thats fine were okay with that because again we manage this industry by industry and i cant control mix but if in fact our nonte which has a lower mdr on average than te if that continues to grow and grow i think everybody would be happy with that operator well go next to the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 good morning thank you for taking my questions i did want to i appreciate youre looking at it as a little bit of an investment year and repositioning maybe positioning the company for growth so eps is not that much of a focus maybe in but is there another metric that maybe we should focus on whether its billings growth new card acquisitions something like that as we go through the year i guess how will you or do you think the investors should judge american expresss progress towards that through the year towards the goal of getting back to call it a share is there a bogey you could provide maybe on card acquisitions or something else maybe is it million a quarter in new acquisitions something like that anything you could talk about there thank you jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well i think it all comes back mihir as you pointed out to rebuilding growth momentum and so thats a function of watch our success in bringing new customers into the franchise and in putting new products into the hands of our existing customers and well talk about that every quarter watch our success on some of the longer term things that steve talked about how were doing with china how were doing with the kabbage acquisition watch externally whats happening with credit and whats happening with the recovery in te spending and those are the key things that i think you want to watch and its what were managing the company for and what well give you an update on each quarter stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and well continue to update on those things as well as merchant acquisition which is also going to be important so sort of the things that i talked about in my first answer exactly what jeff just said again as we said i think as you see more card acquisition momentum that is a good sign you see us put more value propositions in there but also take a look at our merchant network as well and the macroeconomic and the sort of state of health not only in the united states but in the world in general operator well move on to the line of lisa ellis with moffettnathanson go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hi good morning glad to be joining these calls my question is on the biden administration in two areas stimulus and regulation on stimulus just given your overall experience with how would you expect kind of the proposed next round of stimulus to affect meaning overall like good because of the boost in spending and reduction in delinquencies or more bad because consumers are using a lot of these funds for debt reduction and then second on regulation biden has indicated an increased focus on consumer protection and other aspects of banking regulation so what of his policy areas are you most focused on keeping an eye out for thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well its kind of hard to figure out at this point what they will do what will be done from a consumer regulation perspective you dont know if thats going to be done on debt collection you dont know where that will be but look weve been around years through lots and lots of administrations we started this sort of regulatory journey i guess over the last really focused on our industry over the last years or so and it all started i think with udap american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 and look well comply we will comply and we will do what we need to do and i dont think its going to be a major deterrent to us running our business in any way i mean look have we added more compliance people over the years yes do we spend more time with regulators yes could that be more yeah it could probably be more but when you think about the underlying economics of our business i really dont think its going to impact our spend and if you think about our model our model is get the card have a fee spend and then we have lend were not as dependent on lending revenues or lending profits as our competitors are which is probably where a lot of regulation will come in if it does come in so well see well just see how that all plays out and weve been through ive been through many administrations since ive been at american express well do whats required and weve moved on weve demonstrated we can have success under all scenarios and what theyre not talking about is theyre talking about consumer protection were really not talking about discount rate regulation that has not been broached at all in any of these conversations jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co the only comment lisa id add on stimulus is given the demographic of our customer base clearly we are not what we want are healthy consumers and healthy small businesses who are spending lending is not as you know a big part of our business model so the system being awash in liquidity results in higher paydown rates well thats were happy to take that trade for a healthier economy and for more spending and for more recovery so we feel good about the credit performance and the spend performance weve had thus far and more stimulus should that be the political outcome here i have to view is a good thing for us operator well move on to the line of bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning very good call on the targets i think a couple of the keys are the re acceleration of international that was your highest growing segment i guess geographically prior to the pandemic and then also i mean i think the b2b payments kabbage i think theres some comments steve about watching kabbage so just some commentary around your confidence that and what youre seeing internationally i know youre adding locations but are you confident youre at least maintaining market share or gaining share stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well here is what i would say whats interesting bob is that were adding a lot of locations obviously international is being a little bit more challenged than the us our international spending our international cards tend to be a lot more te focused and so theyre down a little bit more but we believe that will come back and so we havent run the numbers on sort of market share at this particular point but as you know we were certainly gaining market share in like eight of the key markets that we participate in and we believe again that theres that pentup demand for travel american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 our attrition numbers are the same showing the same sort of signs that they show in the united states when we talk about attrition we talk about global attrition and there really is no difference between international how international is performing versus how the us is performing so we feel good that that will come back and both small business and consumer international were two of the fastest growing areas as far as kabbage goes i think the thing that were really excited about is kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses and so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan to get a term loan to have now a business checking account to be able to have your card product to do cash flow analysis on the platform it gives us sort of an allinone platform to serve the needs of small businesses which is why we did that and what weve been shooting for over the last couple of years it was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us and that will be well be rolling that out end of  into  and continuing to make enhancements on kabbage so were really excited about it and the opportunities that it brings from a small business perspective operator well go next to the line of bill carcache with wolfe research go ahead please bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thanks good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey bill jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research can you discuss how the return on each dollar of investment spending today is trending versus prepandemic levels on the consumer side how do the acquisition costs and irr of new accounts youre acquiring today compare versus historical levels and on the commercial side how are you assessing the profitability of those investments jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well i think what id say overall bill is id take you right back to our comments that our investment levels in are going to be driven by that universe of attractive opportunities not necessarily by a particular budget so we were really pleased with what we saw in  citing the example of the us consumer platinum and gold progress that we talked about earlier and we also have some nontravel cobrands on the business side that have been very strong so we feel good about the returns american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 i think youve heard steve and i say for many years that we always generally have more good investment opportunities or marketing opportunities with positive returns than we can fund and were setting off in to aggressively rebuild our growth momentum operator well go next to the line of don fandetti with wells fargo your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning steve on competition youve leaned pretty hard into offense are you seeing the same thing from chase and then is there any significance to their cxloyalty acquisition my sense was maybe it was just like playing catch up but was there anything more strategic to that competitively stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co look i think when we think about competition youve got to think about competition across a wide range of places that we compete and theres no more competitive space than the consumer space in the united states i mean theres obviously weve got competition in the uk weve got some competition obviously for small business here corporate competition and so forth so i think its just important to understand you compete on many many fronts and while the consumer business is a large piece of it and probably the most highly competitive and it has been for probably years look we anticipate that not only jpmorgan but bank of america citi capital everybody is going to be out there looking to get card members to bring more into the fold and to drive top line revenue so i dont think theres been a stepdown in competition i think you will see a i think jamie said on his call hes stepping up his investments and i think its pretty much every ceo would say the same thing so we anticipate that its going to be just as competitive as its been as we have seen over the last few years and look we look forward to it and we look forward to competing and we believe our value propositions will continue to stand up well to our competitors look i dont know about their acquisition and what it is that theyre trying to achieve theyve got lot of smart people over at jpmorgan and i think they do a really great job running their business and weve got a lot of respect for them and so im sure theyll figure out how to integrate this into their value propositions to compete in the most effective way that they deem is the right way to go about it and well continue to do what we do and we feel good about the hand that we hold and off well go and well see what happens but i think for more color on that i would ask jamie and gordon operator and our final question will come from the line of craig maurer with autonomous research go ahead please craig maurer q analyst autonomous research llp yeah good morning hey everybody stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2021 hey craig jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey craig craig maurer q analyst autonomous research llp i wanted to ask quickly about trends youre seeing uk can you discuss how their lockdowns impacted volume at the end of the quarter and into first quarter and secondly what type of rebound are you seeing in australia as that country has now become relatively covidfree thanks jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well two comments in the uk and europe more generally as you would expect craig you saw in december and now into january some significant declines in restaurants and other te but what you continue to see stability in those is the nonte spending so its an interesting observation that as europe has locked down more it has the expected impact on restaurants and lodging that people were doing locally but it doesnt have an impact on te and to go to australia australia like many of our nonus markets was heavily heavily or more heavily than the us driven by te and of course te that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross border travel and there are also many restrictions on crossstate travel within australia so nonte spending in australia as it does around the world looks good but the te spending while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world thats not where the bigger dollars are the bigger dollars is on are on other parts of travel and thats going to be slower to come back and is going to await a lessening of the government lockdowns vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american
