sixth consecutive quarter of strong performance since we announced the growth plan in january of revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and reached a record high for the fifth straight quarter earnings per share of is also a quarterly record and is also up over last year based on our performance through the first half we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of delivering revenue growth of to and eps of to we also remain focused on achieving our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond in a steadystate macro environment i continue to feel very good about our ability to achieve these longterm aspirations let me tell you why as i said on previous calls and at investor conferences we have a business model thats differentiated from others in the industry which gives us some important advantages our business model is built largely around a feebased premium our feebased premium products which drive our expensecentric economics and produce a fastgrowing stream of subscriptionlike revenues spending is the largest contributor of revenues while lending plays a more modest role in our model this revenue mix is a key differentiator for us it all starts with our premium customer base which is built on our trusted brand we have a global scale thats unmatched in the industry and leadership positions with a diverse range of highquality customers we build longterm relationships through our unique membership model which we constantly evolve to attract new customers and grow with them over time american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 our highspending card members attract a wide ph array of merchants and business partners giving our customers and partners even more reasons to stay with us which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth partnerships play an important role in our model with a long history of partnering with brands who share our values of backing customers with worldclass products and services and who value developing broadbased and longterm relationships with us hilton is one of those longstanding partnerships our relationship started years ago when we opened a travel office in a hilton hotel in madrid and grew it to a merchant relationship after we began issuing cards and then became our first cobrand partner in the the partnership has lasted and grown over time because we evolved together and put our customers at the center of what we do today im pleased to announce that weve signed a 10year extension of our relationship with hilton which includes continuing as the exclusive cobrand issuer of hilton consumer and small business cards in the united states as well as extensions of our travel and merchant relationships this extension builds on the strong foundation we built over the years with hilton and gives us a long runway to invest in products and services and ph experiences that attract new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones its a great example of the strength of our business model in that it touches virtually all aspects of our business providing our customers and our partner with exceptional value our philosophy of making continuous strategic investments in our business model is whats driving our growth today and its the way we plan to run our business going forward for our second quarter performance the power of our differentiated model can be seen in our results card member spending hit another alltime high in the quarter with us consumers and card members outside the us both up by double digits which offset some softness in us small business millennial and gen z consumers continue to be the fastestgrowing portion of our card member base with us billings up in the quarter of particular note youll recall our international card business was our fastestgrowing segment for several years prior to the pandemic and its again the fastestgrowing we continue to see strong growth in travel and entertainment spending which increased by double digits in the quarter and remain strong across customer categories and geographies  was a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our resy platform and bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest level since before the pandemic we also saw continued strong demand for our premium products in the quarter with over of the new accounts we acquired on feebased products and more than of new customer accounts acquired globally are coming from millennials and gen zs while the number of new accounts is important we pay particular attention to the quality and potential revenues they represent and when you look at the accounts weve acquired over the last year compared to those we acquired over a comparable period prepandemic the overall revenue being generated by these new accounts is up substantially over importantly we continue to be thoughtful about who we grow with and how and you see that in our results our credit metrics remain bestinclass supported by the premium nature of our customer base our robust risk management capabilities and the thoughtful underwriting actions we take on an ongoing basis that weve discussed with you on these calls over the last several quarters before i turn it over to jeff i want to take a couple minutes to talk about our cfo transition as we announced last month jeff will be stepping down as our cfo on august at which time our deputy cfo christophe le caillec will become cfo of the company first i want to recognize jeff and thank him for his outstanding tenure as our cfo for the past decade hes been an invaluable partner and friend to me and to american express throughout his time at the company jeffs insights strategic acumen and calm focused

business and his experience and thoughtful analysis play a key role in our strategic decisionmaking im sure you will all enjoy getting to know him with that ill now turn it over to jeff for his 85th earnings call as a public company cfo and his 41st and final call as the cfo of american express jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our second quarter results which are tracking with the guidance we gave for the fullyear and reflects steady progress against our longterm growth aspirations starting with our summary financials on slide our second quarter revenues were billion reaching a record high for the fifth straight quarter up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis this revenue momentum drove reported net income of billion and earnings per share of up yearover year this does represent a quarterly eps record for the company and it also reflects the sequential strengthening we expected as we move through the year that i mentioned last quarter pretax preprovision income was billion up versus the same time period last year reflecting the strong growth momentum in our underlying earnings so now lets get into a more detailed look at our results which in our spendcentric business model always begins with a look at volumes which you see on slides through in total youve seen on slide that we did reach a new record level for spending on our network this quarter with total network volumes and billed business up and yearoveryear respectively on an fxadjusted basis of course id remind you the growth rates were particularly elevated last quarter as we lapped the impact of omicron in the first quarter of the prior year we are now seeing the more stable rates that we expect are more representative of the kind of growth rates we will see in the balance of the year goods and services spending grew overall in the second quarter we saw good growth in goods and services spending in us consumer and international card services with and respectively while the growth rate in us sme did continue to slow down a bit further from last quarter in contrast we saw very strong growth in travel and entertainment spending across geographies and customer types up overall driven by sustained demand for travel and dining experiences looking forward i would expect this growth rate to remain in the doubledigits through the rest of this year turning to our largest segment us consumer grew billings strongly at this quarter millennial and gen z customers continued to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing yearoveryear you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services with strong growth across both geographies and customer types spending from international consumers grew while spending from international sme and large corporate customers grew this strength in spending growth from our us consumers and card members outside the us offset the continued softness in us sme spending growth that we have been talking about for the past few quarters american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 looking at commercial services us sme growth came in at this quarter looking forward we will continue to monitor these spending trends our us large and global corporate customers also grew billings in the second quarter as weve said for many years these customers while not a particular growth driver for our business do remain an important foundation for the companys business model taking all of this into account spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our longterm aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing prepandemic now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw good continued sequential growth as well as yearoveryear growth of year overyear growth moderated a bit this quarter as we expected but remains elevated versus prepandemic levels the interestbearing portion of our loan and receivable balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see as our customers continue to rebuild balances importantly the majority of this revolving loan growth in the us continues to come from our high credit quality existing customers we also included a disclosure this quarter showing that only of our us card member loans and receivables comes from customers with a fico less than as you then turn to credit and provision on slides through this high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our bestinclass credit performance our card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remain below pre pandemic levels delinquency rates remained flat quarteroverquarter while writeoff rates continued to move up a bit this quarter as we expected as you can see on slide going forward as weve talked about for many quarters now we continue to expect these delinquency and writeoff rates to increase over time but they are likely to remain below prepandemic levels in turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide the quarteroverquarter growth in our loan balances was the primary driver of our million bill there was also a small component from incorporating a slightly worse macroeconomic outlook this quarter relative to last quarter this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the second quarter as you see on slide we ended the second quarter with billion of reserves representing of our total loans and card member receivables this reserve rate remains about basis points below the levels we had prepandemic or day one cecl we continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through while also reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the second quarter on an fxadjusted basis our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearover year in  as you can see on slide driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the second quarter on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide growth remains quite strong and continues to be driven largely by bringing new accounts on to our feepaying products this quarter we acquired million new cards and the spend revenue and credit profiles of these acquisitions continued to look strong relative to what we saw prepandemic importantly the acquisition trends you see on slide in this and recent quarters are consistent with our longterm growth aspirations moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear driven primarily by the growth in our revolving loan balances to sum up on revenues on slide were seeing broadbased revenue growth across our revenue lines were tracking with our expectations so looking forward we still expect to see revenue growth within our range of to for the full year of the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments weve made and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses these costs came in at total revenues in the second quarter and are tracking with our expectation for them to run at around of total revenues on a fullyear basis on the marketing line we invested billion in the quarter on track with our expectation to have fullyear marketing spend of around billion we american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow slower than revenues while continuing to drive the highquality ph new bookings that steve discussed earlier moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the second quarter also tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around billion for the full year this quarter you see that as we expected we have far less growth in opex relative to our highlevel of revenue growth and looking forward we continue to see opex as a key source of leverage turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter including common stock purchases of billion and million in common stock dividends all on the back of strong earnings generation now as you know this is an offcycle year for amex as a ccar bank but let me briefly remind you of our capital management approach we generally increase our dividend roughly in line with earnings and targeted to payout ratio and you saw us do that as we increased our dividend by to per share last quarter we target a cet1 ratio between and and we ended the second quarter in the middle of that range at as we think about the potential finalization of basel iii id remind you that our to cet1 target range is actually well above our current regulatory minimum of we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth and we dont expect any material nearterm changes to our capital management approach driven by the evolution of these rules so that then brings us to slide and the growth plan to step back for a minute i joined american express years ago in because i was excited about the longterm growth prospects for the company today as i join you for my last earnings call im actually even more excited about those growth prospects steve and i first introduced our new multiyear growth aspirations back in january of and i would point out that christophe was in the room for every key decision we made as we developed that plan with the senior business leaders across amex now in july of we have consistently achieved the aspirations we set out six quarters ago thanks to the great efforts of our colleagues across american express so we are re confirming today our fullyear revenue guidance of to growth with eps in the range of to our revenue momentum and customer acquisition trends are positioning us well for our growth aspirations this year in and beyond so this momentum combined with this being my 85th consecutive earnings call across three industries without a break makes this a good time for me to transition the cfo role to christophe with that ill ask christophe to say a few words before steve and i take your questions christophe le caillec deputy chief financial officer american express co thank you jeff and good morning everyone im excited to continue the strong legacy of performance that steve and jeff have delivered and look forward to spending time with many of you on the call in the coming months with that ill turn the call over back to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions donna american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and congratulations jeff youve had quite a run at american express youve been very helpful throughout your tenure and im sure you will be in your remaining position christophe i look forward to working with you my first question is on billed business growth obviously theres so much noise over the last couple of years and even in this year and im just jeff you talked about stabilization going forward and expecting that could you just talk about what gives you the confidence that you see that stabilization because were still a little bit above trend in terms of that growth and then what you need in the back half to get to that growth guidance on revenues jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co so gosh i guess i dont particularly sanjay see us above trend what gives us confidence is looking at what has actually happened in our business over the course of this year in the first quarter you were clearly lapping omicron and that was in some ways i think the last of the pandemicdriven noise in our results as you got into the second quarter we have seen stabilization across geographies at a level that i would suggest is actually consistent with being in a pretty lowgrowth economy and what youre hearing from us is with the kind of volume growth that you see this quarter which we think has stabilized which we think will continue that is consistent with both the guidance we provided for this year as well as with our longerterm growth aspirations i would point out at some point the economy is likely to get stronger but even with the economy in its current kind of lowgrowth state the volume growth that were seeing now allows us to achieve what we have been committing to for six quarters now stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and look i mean just look at consumer right i mean consumer in the us is up at te is still very very strong we talked about travel bookings travel bookings more than one month out are higher than theyve been prepandemic they were higher than they were at this time last year they were higher than they were obviously in international is really coming back strong for us and as we said its the fastestgrowing part of our business and the other thing ill point out is you had a little hangover of noise from omicron in this quarter because last year you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter and if you look at if you go back and look sequentially last year it was a huge increase sequentially quarter overquarter so we feel really good about it i mean its hard to apologize for record billings and as jeff said its the billings we need to hit our growth plan so we feel really good about it and the other point ill just reiterate again is that look were in a lowgrowth economy right now were still out there acquiring card members credit is really good our base is changing in terms of more millennials and gen z who grow with us and as the economy gets better we expect spending to pick up so we feel really confident operator thank you the next question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc jeff its been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in the future and christophe im looking forward to working with you in the future maybe to drill down into two areas that were highlighted on the call first commercial obviously weve seen a big slowdown there to yearoveryear growth steve maybe just talk about whats driving the slowdown and what do we need to see for a reacceleration and maybe just drill a little bit further on te in terms of your confidence like it seems like sequentially it may have slowed a little bit but i take the point that yearoveryear growth rates are still strong so can you maybe just talk about what you see as the key drivers of that remaining in doubledigits thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean from a te perspective and i think you just have to listen to our friends at delta and what ed had said i mean theyre seeing record growth and for us were seeing we have a line of sight into future bookings and so when you look at sort of consumer te restaurant not only is airline bookings up but if you look at whats going on with restaurants in terms of resy i mean restaurant is probably not the biggest segment that we have in te we have all other but well wind up disaggregating that they grew and so we have really strong te growth and i think that people are just back traveling and so the line of sight into what we see from resy and the activity we see on resy from a restaurant perspective from the activity that we see in our consumer travel business we feel really indiscernible about that as far as small business and corporate look i think lets talk about large corporate first i think large corporate its crawling its way back is the best way to describe it it is a small piece of our business its about of our business right now its an important piece of our business and we value all the corporate relationships that we have but as many of us know the first step is to get people into indiscernible and the second step is to get them out on to the road and i think what youre seeing a little bit less of is those onestop trips that quick hop to london to meet with that one client or that quick sort of run across the country to have an internal meeting youre seeing less of that so i think that will continue to come back we continue to be aggressive obviously at retaining those customers and aggressively acquiring new customers but i think thats going to be slower i dont think thats coming back as fast which is a contrast to consumer as far as small business goes i think when we look at small business i think the biggest thing there from a small business perspective is really the organic growth i think organic growth has slowed i dont think thats an amex phenomenon i think thats a little bit of an industry phenomenon and i think small businesses grew very very rapidly and i think they have slowed down what we have focused in on from a small business perspective is making sure were continuing to acquire more small business customers continuing to meet the other needs that they have which are some lending needs for existing customers and also their deposit needs and so as we grow both aspects of those business and as when theyre ready to grow again well be ready to grow judiciously with them and thats what were focused on american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 so look would we prefer that our sme business was growing like our consumer business sure we would but there are these cycles and at this particular point in time i think youre seeing a little bit of an industrywide slowdown from a small business perspective but again just to pick up on jeffs point from before after the slow down comes a recovery so well be poised for that operator thank you the next question is coming from betsy graseck of merchant services please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and jeff all the best its been great working with you and christophe looking forward to meeting you and working with you as well i did just want to make sure i understood the guide on the rev outlook here because what im hearing and tell me where im wrong what im hearing is that billings growth youre anticipating something similar to what you generated this quarter on a yearonyear basis for the second half of this year and thats a little bit of a slower pace obviously than the rev guide of to clearly was very strong well above that so im just trying to understand if the other lines in revenue are going to more than make up for that ie net interest income maybe you could speak to that a little bit or some of the other fee lines that drive your outlook for the to for the fullyear rev guide thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co so i think its an important question betsy but if you really just look at this quarter the thing i would point out is you do have some unusual noise in the service fees and other revenue line when you look at our slide in the slide deck because in the prior year we had a complicated litigation settlement that drove some unusual movement in that line what were really saying is that we are in a low growth economy but it is consistent with the objectives weve set if you maintain the volume growth that we have and then combine it with the kind of consistent highgrowth in that card fees that youve seen right through the pandemic grew this quarter if you combine it with the fact that you still have customers rebuilding balances a little bit on the net interest income side and you take the noise out on the service fee and other revenue side you then easily get to a number that is very consistent in the back half of the year with what weve guided for the full year stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co and i think here is a great example of the model right i mean its a great example of the threelegged stool weve got card fee growth is very very strong i mean its a third i think its the third straight quarter weve had of card fee plus growth yeah were benefiting a little bit from net interest income as jeff said theres noise in the services fee and other revenue and that will shift but yeah we feel comfortable with billings around where american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 we are today to make that revenue guidance because of the three tiers of revenue that we have so thats what gives us confidence operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question hey jeff i often say this in these circumstances a little bit tongue and cheek that were going to miss you more than youre going to miss us but i think thats absolutely true here its been a pleasure working with you over the years and christophe were looking forward to getting to know you as well i do betsy really sort of pulled on the thread that im interested pursuing as well but would love to sort of think about this a little bit more when we looked at the deceleration of top line in the second quarter if revenue stays on that trajectory for the second half of the year it sort of puts you at the lowend of your top line guidance it sounds like theres a little bit of noise that gives you some confidence but im curious fundamentally do you think we will see some acceleration in the back half to sort of offset any potential risks if you just look at the trend line stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co we still feel really confident that well be within the to and theres really not a lot more to say other than that so you have a little as i said you have a little bit of deceleration from a billings perspective but its a record quarter of billings over billion of billings and so again we feel very confident of the to and well see where it winds up landing within that range but thats the reason we give ranges operator thank you the next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you thank you very much and jeff thank you for your help and good luck to you christophe welcome look forward to meeting you id like to ask about your views on credit normalization kind of a trend in credit normalization as you look at your portfolio what we should expect as we look at the aspirations for so the i mean the back half of is pretty baked but just as we think about that going into and onward jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i think the most important point to make there bob is that we have a portfolio today that is more premium and stronger than what we had in in day one cecl that is why we added the additional disclosure this quarter around these small percentage of our portfolio that it is in the band where you do see challenges and thats the fico band below so we feel really good about where we are from a credit perspective in this environment i think we feel really good about the fact that when you look sequentially you actually saw delinquencies flat there is complexity in the cecl calculation when you try to do comparisons across companies i did make the observation that the way and with the timing of how we do ours we actually incorporated a slightly worse economic outlook this quarter than we did last quarter sitting here on july i think most people would say things of perhaps gotten a bit more optimistic in recent days but well have to see how that influences things american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 at the core though we feel really good about the product choices the acquisition choices and the risk management choices weve made which leave us confident that we will be below this year on credit metrics all of the places we were in and absent some dramatic change in the economy and i think we feel good about what that means for operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ftp securities llc yeah good morning jeff for meeting you in the middle of an ice storm until now i appreciate all the help over the years and christophe looking forward to meeting you soon so my question my two questions really are around one sme just wanted to dig in a little further there if you could help me understand if there was a meaningful difference in growth between the total number and if you just looked at it on the same business activity level and took out the new business ads and second has there been any real difference in credit vintages weve recently seen some data on consumer loans that have shown a real deterioration in recent vintages of loans so wanted to ask about that thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so for the second question first the answer is no its really not but jeff do you want to jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well with the only color id remind you over the course of the past year craig we have talked about the fact that we have consistently made some adjustments from a risk management perspective and i think that is part of why as steve says we just dont see any change from a vintage perspective stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co as far as line of sight into sme i mean the way to think about it is organic is probably flat you obviously had businesses that go out of business and so you have a little bit of sort of same indiscernible that go away but the acquisition is still relatively strong so think about organic is having a neutral impact think about attrition because attrition has a negative impact but no different than what weve seen over the last few years and then acquisition in there i think the biggest difference is really organic and what you saw through the pandemic is you saw small businesses continue to add and add and add and you got to remember small businesses use a card to run their entire business and so there was a lot of buying ahead from a goods and services perspective from an inventory perspective and so were going to watch it really closely in terms of have they finally gotten to sort of full stock and what have you and i think thats the way to think about those three components organic basically flat acquisition up and attrition pretty much stable operator thank you the next question is coming from lisa ellis of moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hey thank you thanks for taking my question you guys highlighted that it is now six quarters since you introduced the structural increase in your longterm plan to doubledigit revenue growth and midteens eps american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 growth a lots happened in the last six quarters were kind of finally returning to normal after the pandemic so can you just highlight when you look at the underlying business drivers required to sustain that model on an ongoing basis what is sort of doing better than you expected maybe where do you need to make some adjustments et cetera just kind of comment on how that strategy and your thoughts about that has evolved as you look forward now coming back into a more normalized economy thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah well i think you got to go back to sort of strategic priorities we always talk about which is focused on premium consumer were focused on small business and were focused on coverage if i look at this i would say that international has come back probably even a little quicker than we had thought within our threeyear horizon i think millennials are playing out even better than what we had thought both from an acquisition perspective and a spending perspective i think when you think about boomers i think theyve been slower to return but it becomes a smaller piece of our business over time corporate i think thats an opportunity going forward from a growth perspective and i think small business started out in the beginning small business winded up being a tale of three cities over this time horizon i think it was really really strong for us last year i think its a little bit more muted its a little bit more muted and i think itll probably pick up and the other thing thats been different when we started with this plan it was done in a much slower it was done we anticipated a more robust economy so what really makes us feel good about this is that weve accomplished this in a slowgrowth environment weve stayed true to who we are from a credit quality perspective and the last thing that ill add is i think weve made some really great coverage gains over this period of time as we continue to march to our goals especially international where i think the team has done a really good job from a coverage perspective and when you think about our longerterm partnerships here we really cemented in our key partnerships over the longterm here obviously with delta and with ph hilton we still have marriott and ba which go out still a number of years so we feel good about it and the interesting part about this is did it play out exactly as we thought it was going to play out no but the flexibility in the model has enabled it to go where we wanted it to go and i think we really got off to a tremendous start in with tremendous revenue growth i mean when we did this threeyear plan we did not project revenue growth last year we were at to i believe when we started the year then we took it up to to and then you got so if you think about sort of where we thought we were going to be were ahead of where we thought we were going to be longerterm and the to guidance that we provided at the beginning of this year was based off of original guidance that was to so were growing over bigger numbers and thats why i feel really good about it and so well continue and i think the most important thing for us is to stay focused and to focus on our priorities and i think the team has done a really good job of that and you have to remember and you guys all know this this is a very good industry to be in and when you play in this industry the way we play in it across three different dimensions of card fees of billings and of net interest income it makes our model completely differentiated from our competitors operator thank you the next question is coming from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 thanks your marketing expense pulled back a bit this quarter you still have high customer acquisitions how are you thinking about marketing expenses going into the second half of the year and if you could provide a kind of quartertodate update in terms of your growth rate of billed business stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co were not going to do a quartertodate update of billed business were kind of days in so theres no real change but in terms of marketing the only thing thats important to know is that we said wed spend about billion on marketing thats our plan to continue to do that how it winds up sort of moving from quarterto quarter i think were probably million from last year or something like this in this particular quarter but it all depends on the programs were running and the timing and everything else and so a week here or a week there can make all the difference in the world sometimes when you think about spending billion billion in a quarter its like million sort of a week so bottom line is we are committed to go after all the great opportunities that are out there and we believe that well wind up spending about billion from a marketing perspective and just to remind everybody the marketing spend for us is predominantly customer acquisition right and affiliate fees and incentives and things like that its not sort of tv and print and just kind of advertising thats what that marketing spend is and thats why it can vary a little bit from quartertoquarter operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer and co please go ahead dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for the question so i was just wondering when you think about your aspirational revenue target has the thought process on the contribution to growth from net card fees to total revenue changed over time where its potentially providing more of a boost towards that revenue goal versus the past versus discount rate revenue thanks guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no look i think one of the big differentiators for us is that card fee i mean you think about that as sort of subscription saas kind of revenue and were really pleased with that but no i mean its in the ballpark of what we thought it was going to be as we put together our aspirations right i mean and so when you look at this three quarters in a row is a big number and the other thing id point out during the pandemic it was growing in doubledigits and so which is its a big contributor and its obviously a higher it has higher growth than discount revenue would but its pretty much in line with where we thought we were going to be jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co i just cant resist adding dominick it for something that grew in doubledigits all through the pandemic has had really high growth rates the last year it is going to continue to grow to be an everbigger part of our revenue indiscernible and i think that is a key strength of the company it really ties customers and engages customers with us and the product and is a critical part to the overall model american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co just one other thing because jeff just sort of reminded me as he said that when we talked about sort of this this doubledigit growth during the pandemic it really speaks to how we think about our customers over the longterm because if we had not invested in our customers during the pandemic you would not have seen that doubledigit growth during the pandemic or coming out of the pandemic it was really important to embrace those customers it would have been easier to drop more money to the bottom line rather than to put more money into our existing customers but thats not how we run the company and we were thinking much more from a long term perspective and by really investing in the value propositions because as you all remember those value propositions from a travel perspective were challenged fast and to put other things in there it really helped to cement those relationships which kept those fees going but more important dropped just normal attrition that we had because we improved our retention rates over the course of the pandemic so i think it speaks to the membership model because this card fee is a decision that our members make to join the franchise and thats really important because that means they see value in the product they see ongoing value in the product and its our job and well continue to do this to continue to insert more values into the product and thats what keeps this thing going and thats why from a strategic perspective the consistent refreshing of our products is really really important to our strategy operator thank you the next question is coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah congratulations jeff and christophe jeff i wanted to clarify on the basel comment are you saying you wont have to run at a higher cet1 than your target of to i know there was some concern around fees being looked at differently wonder if you can clarify that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co don you were cutting out a little bit but i think youre asking about the cet1 target in basel iii and the point i was trying to make is you need to remember a few things here our to cet1 target is actually more driven by our own view and rating agency views versus the regulatory constraints because our regulatory minimum has long been only thats the first point the second point to remember is we have a return on equity of over so our ability to quickly replenish capital whenever we need to without frankly taking more than a brief pause from share repurchase is very high third i know theres been a lot of attention paid to different iterations of the basel iii endgame particularly around ops risk i guess id also just remind people ops risk is only one component there are other components that probably have some positives and probably have some negative impacts on us so i guess well have to see whenever the final rules come out weve been waiting for them for i feel like much of my tenure here but when they come out hopefully later this month and the devils in the details here but i think my overarching message is we dont see it as a material event for this company because its certainly a possible outcome that theres no change in our target and even a modest change in our target with a 30plus roe is not going to have any material impact on share repurchase or the trajectory of our eps growth that weve laid out in the growth plan operator thank you our final question is coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2023 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you for taking my questions and good morning congratulations jeff thank you for all your help and welcome christophe i look forward to getting to know and working with you wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk about the process revenues of the network partnerships i think the old gs business it seems like theres been a little bit of momentum in terms of signing some new partners recently i believe this quarter we actually saw the launch of the square card and processed volumes grew faster than billed business this quarter so just wondering if you could talk about that business a little bit more has there been something has something changed internally are you focused more on that segment whats driving that momentum thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no i dont think anything has changed i think these are its always been something that we have been focused on but to switch or to get a partner to come on to the network is a big deal and there are technical hurdles to wind up crossing and the gs team is out there on a consistent basis looking for new partners and when you think about our overall model were really operating around proprietary countries all the rest of the markets that we operate around the world are gs markets either just from a card acceptance perspective or from a both card acceptance and a card issuing perspective and theres been a lot of work going on with gs over the years to get to increasingly get more and more coverage and so when you look at our improvements in coverage so much of thats been driven by our gs partners and just to remind you that everything that were doing in china is really it really comes under the heading of gs because were in there just as a network we dont acquire merchants we dont issue cards we have a joint venture and thats a gs relationship and look our launch of our card i mean with square thats been in the pipeline for a long time but if you arent in cards or if youre issuing visa mastercards its a little bit different to hook up to our systems to get priority within your own system and so forth so weve been out there on a consistent basis working to get partners i think the square one has a little bit more i guess a little bit more headlines because its a us partnership but the team is out there on a real consistent basis all across asia and south america and africa and so forth really thinking through how we continue to get more coverage and how we get more cards issued so while you may see it a little bit more i can tell you that the team has been working really hard at this for a lot of years kerri s bernstein senior
