that let me turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thank you kerri good morning and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call  was our seventh consecutive quarter of strong performance continuing the momentum weve built over the last few years and aligned with the growth plan we announced in it was the sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues which reached billion up yearoveryear earnings per share of was also a new quarterly record based on our performance to date we remain confident in our ability to achieve fullyear revenue growth and eps growth that is consistent with the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year and we are well positioned as we seek to achieve our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond in a steadystate macro environment my confidence is based on several factors including the many attractive opportunities available to us because of the businesses and geographies we operate in our unique membership model which powers a virtuous cycle of growth the success of the strategic investments weve been making in key areas of our business and our ability to leverage our differentiated business model which includes our premium global customer base integrated payments platform strong partner relationships and trusted brand american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 together these factors have driven our strong performance over the past two years including the continued momentum we saw in the third quarter in the quarter card member spending remained strong up yearover year on an fxadjusted basis spending was strongest in our us consumer segment up and international card services segment up on an fxadjusted basis and us small business spending increased slightly from a yearago millennial and gen z consumers continue to be the fastestgrowing portion of our card member base with spending from this demographic in the us up yearoveryear and they accounted for more than of all new consumer account acquisitions globally in the quarter demand for our products remain robust particularly for feebased products which represented more than of the new accounts acquired in the quarter customers continue to be highly satisfied with our products and services which drives high levels of engagement and retention we were rated the number one us credit card company for customer satisfaction by jd power for the fourth consecutive year and the 13th time in years of the study and our credit metrics remain bestinclass as we continue our focus on growing with discipline and a strong focus on risk management across the portfolio a key reason for the momentum were seeing is the investments weve been making in innovating our value propositions to deliver generational relevance across all age groups resy is a good example of some of the ways were doing this we acquired resy and continued to invest in building out the platform because we know that dining is something that all generations of card members care about weve seen that in our results as restaurants continued to be the largest and one of the fastestgrowing te categories in the third quarter the number of resy users restaurants on the platform and reservations booked all continue to grow significantly in  reservations on the platform set another quarterly record over the last few years weve also ramped up the number of exclusive lifestyle experiences sponsorships and access to events we offer that appeal to our card members across generations and geographies and reinforce the unique value of membership our highly popular experiences cut across entertainment sports food art and fashion they generate strong onsite engagement with our branded activities and offers and they help drive interest among prospects they also continue to attract worldclass partners who work with us to add new ways for our card members and prospects to experience the power of amex membership earlier this week we announced our latest sponsorship an exclusive multiyear agreement with formula to be the official payments partner of formula in the americas this sponsorship is our first new sports vertical in over years and it represents a great opportunity to build on a rapidly growing popularity of formula racing around the world another way were delivering generational relevance is by regularly refreshing and adding value to our products on a global basis these product enhancements are tailored to the interest and spending patterns of our customers of all age groups in each local market so far this year weve made enhancements to over premium products across the company some of the latest of which were refreshes of our platinum card products in japan our business gold card in the us and just yesterday our hilton cobranded consumer cards these examples and many others like them are further enriching our membership model which helps us to attract new premium customers drive retention and deepen engagement with current customers and add more merchants and partners who provide offers and experiences that deliver additional value looking ahead i feel very good about where we are and where were going well continue our strategy of investing for growth and american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 adding more differentiated value to our membership model to deliver generational relevance while continuing to leverage the strengths of our business model all of which gives us a competitive advantage ill now hand the call over to christophe le caillec for additional details on our quarterly results christophe le caillec chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone im excited to have my first earnings call be one where we discuss our continued strong momentum which is reflected in our record revenue and eps in the third quarter i would like to take a minute at the outset to share my perspective on the company as someone who has been here for a long time and through various business environments the company is very focused on driving high levels of profitable revenue growth the key enabler of that growth has been the discipline we use to deploy our resources as a result the underlying quality of our business is very strong and i have confidence in the sustainability of the growth drivers that we are seeing we have accelerated the pace of our revenue and eps growth since before the pandemic that acceleration is a direct result of the strategy that underpins our growth plan which steve described in the quarter that strategy has driven billion more in billings versus last quarter the company is also generating almost billion more in revenue and about million more in net income compared to a year ago this demonstrates the earnings power of our business model now lets take a look at the details of this quarters performance starting with our summary financials on slide third quarter revenues were billion they reached a record high for the sixth straight quarter and were up yearoveryear this revenue momentum drove reported net income of billion and earnings per share of which grew yearoveryear lets now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results in our spendcentric business model that begins with a look at billed business starting on slide total billed business grew billion this quarter versus last year up on an fxadjusted basis as we continue to see the more stable growth rates that we expected this growth was driven by growth in goods services spending consistent with last quarters growth rate and sustained doubledigit growth in travel and entertainment spending this doubledigit te growth has been driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences with restaurant spending our largest category up this quarter total network volumes grew yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis as you look at these results id note that we exited a small product last quarter that was reported in our processed volumes this is reflected in the  growth rate and expect to see the impact of the yearoveryear growth rate continue for the next few quarters until we lap this exit as a reminder processed volume includes volumes from cards where we play more of a network role and from alternative payment solutions that we facilitate the revenue associated with these volumes makes up a small portion of our total revenue which you can see on slide as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses there are a few other key points to take away starting with our largest segment on slide us consumer grew billings strongly at this quarter our focus on attracting engaging and retaining our premium card members is driving growth across all generations american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 and age cohorts millennial and gen z customers continue to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending up this quarter looking at commercial services on slide us sme growth came in at this quarter consistent with last quarters growth rate as steve discussed on our  call organic growth in this segment has slowed given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years importantly we do continue to see strong high quality demand for new accounts within this segment looking forward we focus on continuing to help sme clients run their businesses billings from our us large and global corporate customers were flat yearoveryear as we have said for many years these customers are not a major growth driver for our business but they remain an important foundation for the companys business model and lastly on slide you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services we saw strong growth across our geographies and customer types spending from international consumers and from international sme and large corporate customers each grew overall strength in spending growth from our us consumers and card members outside of the us continues to offset the softness with commercial services that weve been talking about for the past few quarters taking everything into account our spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the full year and our longterm aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were generating pre pandemic now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of as well as good continued sequential growth as our customers continue to rebuild balances the interestbearing portion of our loans and receivables balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see importantly over of our revolving loan growth in the us continues to come from our tenured customers as you then turn to credit and provision on slide through the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show in our bestinclass credit performance as you can see on slide our card member loans and receivables writeoffs and delinquency rates both remain fairly flat to last quarter and below prepandemic levels going forward as weve talked about for many quarters now we continue to expect this delinquency and writeoff rates to increase over time and theyre likely to remain below prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide the quarteroverquarter growth in our loan balances combined with the modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate resulted in a million reserve build this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the third quarter as you see on slide we ended the third quarter with billion of reserves representing of our total loans and card member receivables this reserve rate remained about basis points below the level we had pre pandemic or day cecl we continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit in the balance of year similar to the modest increases weve seen over the past few quarters moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up billion or yearoveryear in the third quarter our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in  as you can see on slide driven by spending trends we discussed earlier net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear on an fx adjusted basis as you can see on slide this growth remains very strong and is powered by the continued american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 attractiveness to both new and existing customers of our feepaying products due to the investment weve made in our premium value propositions as we expected growth moderated a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year reflecting our cycle of product refreshes this quarter we acquired million new cards importantly the acquisition levels you see on slide remain consistent with our longterm growth aspirations the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new card members continued to look strong relative to what we saw prepandemic moving now on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis driven mostly by the growth in our revolving loan balances to sum up revenues on slide were seeing broadbased revenue momentum across our diversified revenue lines for we expect revenue growth to be within the range we communicated in january at around growth for the full year moving to expenses on slide variable customer engagement expenses came in at of total revenues in the third quarter therefore i now expect these costs to run at around of total revenues on the fullyear basis looking forward we view this cost as a key driver of our momentum as we continue to innovate our value propositions to deepen engagement with our premium card members and to attract new ones as steve discussed earlier on the marketing line we invested billion in the quarter i still expect to have marketing spend of around billion for the full year fairly flat to our expense we feel really good about the quality of our new card acquisitions which ive talked about earlier and i continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities given this strong set of opportunities i would expect to increase our marketing spend in the balance of this year and were confident that our sophisticated acquisition engine will continue to do so in an efficient way moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the third quarter as we invest in critical areas such as our talented colleague base and technology taking this into account we now expect our fullyear operating expenses to be around billion looking forward we continue to view marketing and opex as a key source of leverage turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter this included common stock repurchase of billion and million in common stock dividends all on the back of strong earnings generation as you can see on slide we target a cet1 ratio of between to we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of which is wellabove our current regulatory minimum of as we think about the basel iii proposal the rwa increase could consume the buffer above regulatory capital requirements if the proposal is adopted as written notably we believe there are clear opportunities for improvements between the proposal and the final rule in fact the regulators themselves have posed questions about potential issues in applying these rules broadly and we are actively engaged in that dialogue we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth we do not expect any material nearterm changes to our capital management approach that brings me to our growth plan and guidance on slide as steve and i discussed in our third quarter results our third quarter results are a continuation of the strong momentum weve built over the last few years evidenced by our performance across diversified revenue streams american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 for the full year we expect revenue growth of around consistent with the revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year as i discussed before we now expect variable card member engagement expenses to be around of total revenues on a fullyear basis modestly below our original expectation on marketing we still expect to spend around billion for the full year and lastly we now expect our operating expenses to be around billion this year modestly above our original expectation as we invest in areas critical to our success taking everything together our earnings per share guidance remains between and looking forward we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteen eps growth in a steadystate macro environment with that well open up the call for your questions in a moment a final point which relates to our investor relations team here at american express steve and i have decided to move kerri bernstein to the critical role of corporate treasurer id like to thank kerri for leading the ir function during a period of strong performance for the company id then like to welcome kartik ramachandran our new head of investor relations kartik was most recently a key finance leading our us consumer business and has had a number of finance positions over years with the company now let me turn it back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks god morning and congrats christophe kerri kartik steve just a question we hear a lot about the choppy macro backdrop and its impact on spending im just curious if youve seen any changes behavioral over the past quarter that might make you more sanguine on the outlook or do you feel like your customers are unphased and just on a related point i know the delta stuff theres been a lot of headlines on the changes that deltas made to the medallion qualification process im just curious if youve seen any impact thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so thanks sanjay let me start with delta first i think as delta makes changes were in lockstep with them all the way and one of the great things about having delta as a partner is they are a very customerfocused organization and they made some changes the team got some reaction and i think they made some other changes which i think will be and have been received in a very good fashion but as far as spending or card acquisition it has had zero impact so we havent seen anything from a card spending on delta or from a card acquisition in fact delta card spending yearoveryear was up almost so we feel pretty good about that as far as the us consumer lets just talk about the us consumer and international consumer its still strong we had us consumer spending growth in goods services growth on te and that continues to be very strong off a high base and from an international perspective weve seen spending from an international card services perspective and strong both from a goods services and a te perspective and i think its important that ill remind everybody our card base is a really small piece of the overall us economy and one of the reasons we have such great credit metrics is we have a really highquality card member and so at this point in time they have not been impacted by anything but the other thing that i would say is you probably had the same question at this time last year and i probably gave you the same answer and right now look we can only manage the business for what were seeing in our business which is still strong growth and we used the blue chip economic forecast and that calls for pretty much more of the same so in a steadystate macro environment i feel really good about delivering on our plan as christophe said we are wellpositioned and as i said in my remarks were wellpositioned to continue to deliver on our growth plan operator thank you the next question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning steve good morning christophe american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc look as a followup to sanjays question obviously it was good to see the solid revenue growth given the challenging economic backdrop and youre still talking about doubledigit revenue growth next year but can you maybe just talk about some of the pieces or the drivers you expect to see given whats going on in billings growth and are you leaning more into lending in order to drive this growth and then just lastly like do we need to see billings to improve in order to be able to drive doubledigit revenue growth thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well those are a lot of questions ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc i know tried to phase one in this stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co you actually only asked one you just put it in multiple parts ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thats exactly full stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah right well leave that one alone but when you look at our model there are many ways for us to grow revenue we grow revenue from a billings perspective we grow revenue from a card fee perspective and we do grow revenue from a lending perspective the current revenue growth that we had the current billings growth that we have is in line with what our longterm growth aspirations are so where we are from a billings growth perspective we feel really good about that from a fee perspective and i like to point this out is that the major driver of our fee revenue is actually new card acquisition its not raising fees its really new card acquisition and look weve invested were going to invest approximately billion this year well probably step that up next year so were very confident in our card acquisition as christophe said there are a lot of great opportunities out there for us american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 and from a lending perspective and weve mentioned this multiple times our book today we believe is better than our book was in and if our card members we continue to lend responsibly and our card members have various needs at various points in time and i think its that model its our three legged stool of revenue which will continue to provide confidence that were going to be able to deliver doubledigit revenue growth next year christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co and maybe ryan i can add one point on the lending side as steve said we have a premium customer base and were growing lending of that premium customer base of the balances are coming from established card members that we know well so those card members we know revolve with competitors products and historically we underindex on that we capture a big share of their spend a smaller share of that lending and what we do in here is just deepening the relationship with them and capturing a bigger share of their revolving needs operator thank you the next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and congratulations to everyone kerri its been great working with you and good luck so a question steve on the smb business thats a really important business for you its only growing i think therere large opportunities there but can you maybe give a little color on whats going on in smb and your thoughts about smb as we move into stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think this is probably the second quarter in a row its been low growth i think a lot of it a lot of our high growth was really driven by organic growth and we havent seen as much organic growth from a small business perspective i think from an acquisition perspective were still very happy about the opportunities that are out there were still happy about the lending opportunities that are out there and i think small businesses went through a very interesting cycle over the last few years in terms of not having a lot of inventory and stocking up on inventory and so were still very positive on small business albeit the last two quarters were relatively slow but we share your perspective that its still a huge opportunity for us and its a big part of our business from a billings perspective and to remind people our small business footprint is across a variety of small businesses whether its restaurant and retail or professional services and construction and so forth so we still feel good about it and i think that well see just when organic does come back but were still very positive on small business operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question and congratulations kerri really enjoyed working with you and christophe we are looking forward to more dialogue i just have one question there was a comment about raising the reserve rate modestly as we move forward obviously thats not a function of changing economic american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 outlook because you dont know what that will be im assuming its a mix shift issue can you talk about that a little bit in terms of what components are shifting in the mix and the different reserve rates for those products christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah yeah yeah so the trend there is like still a bit of normalization going on so if you look at our delinquency rates they are fairly flat if you squint a little bit youre going to see a couple of basis points increase and thats effectively what i meant when i said that you should expect that reserve rate to increase a little bit where theres still a little bit of normalization happening here but as you know well those delinquency rates and writeoff rates are very strong relative to our historical performance and of course relative to peers so theres nothing that gives me concern in that comment its just to preempt a little bit what we are seeing operator thank you the next question is coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning christophe on the basel iii endgame is the message still unchanged i mean it seems like thats a pretty big increase in rwas and maybe you might have to ultimately dial back the buybacks at some point just wanted to get your thoughts on that christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so this is as you know a complicated set of rules like over pages so let me try to summarize it for you and the way we are thinking about basel iii i think the right starting point is to remind ourselves that first we generate a lot of capital roe in the range the second element of the starting point is that although our regulatory capital is at cet1 at we actually operate with a target of to so thats to basis point north of the regulatory level and what i meant to say in my comment was to say that that buffer could be consumed by the basel iii rules if theyre adopted as currently drafted another way of saying the same thing is that our level of capital today is very healthy given those rules i also need to highlight the fact that in the rules themselves the regulators post some questions about the applicability of these rules to businesses such as ours and they reference the charge card for instance business and as you know over of our revenue comes from fees but those fees are stable visible such as card fees that we talked about a bit earlier and we are actively engaged with the regulators to figure out whats the right thing to do here so well see where we land no one knows but for now i dont expect any change to our nearterm capital management policies and practices operator thank you the next question is coming from jeff adelson of morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes hi thanks for taking my questions just wanted to focus a little bit on the spend versus account growth dynamics it looks like your average spending per card or account is flattening out and your account growth is finally slowing more flat sequentially this quarter even though as you continue to add million new accounts or american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 cards a quarter and indiscernible the backdrop of your marketing a little bit lower this quarter although it sounds like youre going to be leaning back in next quarter to hit that billion so i guess my question is are you seeing something thats causing you to drive a little bit slower account growth here or is there anything going on with attrition or anything with delta stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no i think it comes down to timing and what happens is quarters happen to cutoff on particular days and thats just the way it is but no were committed to the billion overall approximately of marketing you saw a slight sequential drop i think we went under the million for the first time in a while and we look at account growth as or cards acquired from an overall revenue perspective but we still see tremendous opportunities out there which is why we sort of signaled here more than signaled we said were going to raise our marketing expense for next year as well so no were not seeing anything at all that gives us pause and we will continue to acquire those cards as long as those opportunities are out there so you will see a higher level of marketing spending in the next quarter operator thank you the next question is coming from bill carcache of wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning steve and christophe welcome to the call stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc can you share any initial thoughts on the open banking rule that the cfpb recently proposed theres a view that open banking essentially forces banks to hand over the keys to their customer relationships i was just hoping you could speak to any opportunities that may present for amex and then following up on the capital commentary christophe theres a view that you could reduce your op risk if you treated the rewards expense as a contra revenue any thoughts on that would be great thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah look as far as fednow i think lets just go to the uk uk has had open banking for years or so and its really had no impact on our business either positively or negatively so i dont really see this as either a big threat or big opportunity and i think what id like to take you back bill to is what product were actually offering were offering a membership model product basically which has lots of different components other than just commodity paying and our product has so many more benefits from a security perspective a fraud perspective american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 a dispute perspective than an open banking product would have and so i really dont see this as either an opportunity or as a threat to our business either in the short term or in the long term i will turn the other question over to christophe christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so on basel bill there are various things that were discussing with regulators i dont think it would be useful to go through the list here this morning on the call but you raise an important element here which is that nothing is really changing in our business right were still doing the exact same thing and so we need to figure out with regulators what the right level of capital here and not be dependent upon accounting treatment or anything like that so too early to discuss this in detail when we have more clarity well provide you with a ton of basel iii detail operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hi good morning pleasure to meet everybody and kerri thanks so much for all the help i was just curious on your card member rewards as a percentage of billed business it stepped down quite nicely quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear i was just curious if youre seeing anything in particular on the utilization of rewards recently or any commentary around that thank you so much christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so yes our total vce i called out was lower this quarter about so as you know variable card member engagement and rewards is the biggest number there its a very large expense base so were constantly looking at when we do product refreshes when we launch products were looking at ways to make sure that this value proposition works best and we price for this and theres always changes theres always changes as well in terms of how the card members choose to redeem their points from one quarter to another as you know were also adding constantly new redemption partners that changed the mix in terms of the weighted average cost per points so theres at any point in time a lot of variables that will impact that ratio we are very focused on making sure that we have the right ratio versus revenue and we also have the right value proposition that wed be compelling in the marketplace so its a little bit lower this quarter i think we said for the full year because we are seeing its a bit better as well from a fullyear standpoint its still going to be an area of investments for us it drives a lot of growth as well thats one of the key reason why card members sign up for the cards and engage with it and were going to keep working on those value propositions and make sure that we have the right balance here stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co the only other point ill add is that within our value propositions because of our really premium card base lots and lots of partners want to work with us and include benefits within our value propositions to reach our card members and so when you look at the overall value proposition its just not rewards based it is partner based american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 and there are different mechanisms from a funding perspective of how that all works out so thats part and parcel of our value proposition as well operator thank you the next question is coming from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks you continue to outperform on credit at least very much relative to your peers and below prepandemic levels what are your thoughts on net chargeoffs heading into and maybe you could touch a little bit on how the seasoning curves are happening for your recent vintages christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah yeah so were not going to give you a lot of details about on this call we plan to do that at the beginning of next year when we speak about guidance but what i can tell you is that the starting point for us of our credit performance and all our credit decisions is the quality of the products and the fact that it attracts premium card members thats the starting point right we have a very talented risk organization we have a very disciplined execution of our risk decision but it starts with the quality of the product and thats the key differentiator visàvis our peers and thats what we focused on and as you know weve said this many times on this call if anything we are focused even more on the premiumness of the portfolio the new card members because youre talking about vintages new card members were bringing in of those consumer card members are joining the franchise on a feepaying product thats a big statement to join the franchise and so thats what we use to start projecting out theres still as ive said before theres still a little bit of covid noise and normalization going on but we are very pleased with our credit performance that were seeing and as you pointed out the gap versus competitors if anything is increasing further operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ftp securities llc yeah good morning thanks for taking the questions and congrats kerri and kartik on your new roles the net interest yield on card member loans saw a nice improvement in the quarter up basis points quarteronquarter and youre now above  and while i understand what rates are doing the increase was pretty substantial this quarter so i was versus prior quarters so i was wondering how we should expect that to trend and secondly given your visibility due to the accounting treatment of card fees how should we expect that to trend over the coming quarters considering its decelerated for several quarters in a row thank you christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah yeah so on the yield the key thing here there are many moving parts right there are as you know in terms of the funding in terms of their pricing in terms of their there is vintages but the key the biggest element that is driving that small increase in the yield is the revolve rate so the share the revolving balances american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 the interestbearing balances in our total loan balances is increasing a little bit and thats an outcome of our tenured card members rebuilding their balances which is something weve called out for several quarters now and i just want to point out again that most of that growth is coming from most of that growth ie is coming from tenured card members that we know well and we can underwrite well so thats the key driver behind the yield improvement when it comes to card fees youre right we have good visibility because we amortize those fees over months so we see that trend so you should expect that trend to continue a little bit ie the growth rate to moderate as i said a key driver to this is going to be the cycle of product refreshes and its also going to be a function of us investing more marketing dollars bringing on more fee paying card members and that dynamic is just going to play out so you should expect in the next few quarters a bit of a moderation there but i need to call out that its a moderation from a very high level and as we used to say on this call even during the pandemic that specific category was still growing so its still going to grow strongly in doubledigit stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co right and if you go back to the pandemic we were growing in the to and so when you look at the outsized lets call it the growth rates that we had in  and  of you had not acquired cards really in and so when you got to that amortization in the third and fourth quarter of it was lower so the growth rate was a little bit higher as we got in there but look were pretty happy with growth rate over numbers that continue to get bigger operator thank you our final question will come from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in here and congratulations to christophe kerri and kartik i wanted to maybe switch from talking about the card products that the whole call has been talking about a little bit and maybe just talk a little bit about the noncard products i think other loans and receivables is now over billion in total now its obviously been an area where youve spent a lot of time investing in maybe just talk a little bit about that both on the consumer and commercial side where are you seeing some of the strongest growth how do you expect that to trend how much is that contributing to interest yields and etcetera thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so let me sort of just hit from a strategic perspective of what were trying to do and even at billion its still a relatively small piece one of the things were trying to do from a small business perspective is to make sure that we can provide a variety of working capital needs to our small business customers and in that case it can be noncard loans for working capital it can be shorterterm loans for up to two years or so forth and i think part of that was the overall kabbage acquisition that we did to be able to do that because what we wanted to do and it goes along with what we did with sort of our checking account as well is we wanted to make sure that we could provide for small businesses a host of products and services from having a check a transaction account having a lending product having a charge product and then having working capital loans and so i think that really fits in but thats not the driver of growth for us in that segment american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 from a consumer perspective what weve continued to try to do is to really grow our organic footprint with our consumers and you can go back in history it started as a charge card and then we put lending and then we put pay over time and plan it within the product and came up with a savings account and a debit product and also a small component of personal loans and so weve been judicious and careful about how weve gone about that but i think its an important add to make sure that our customers are not going to our competitors when they need products and services like that so thats the sort of strategic sort of backdrop on why we have that kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co okay and with
