option cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information we also make statements in this report and we may from time to time make other statements regarding our outlook for earnings revenues expenses tax rates capital and liquidity levels and ratios asset levels asset quality financial position and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act forwardlooking statements are typically identified by words such as believe plan expect anticipate see look intend outlook project forecast estimate goal will should and other similar words and expressions forwardlooking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions risks and uncertainties to which our forwardlooking statements are subject forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date made we do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forwardlooking statements actual results or future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements as well as from historical performance as a result we caution against placing undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties our businesses financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions including the following changes in interest rates and valuations in debt equity and other financial markets disruptions in the us and global financial markets actions by the federal reserve board us treasury and other government agencies including those that impact money supply and market interest rates changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives changes in customers suppliers and other counterparties performance and creditworthiness impacts of tariffs and other trade policies of the us and its global trading partners the length and extent of economic contraction as a result of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic commodity price volatility our forwardlooking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies these statements are based on our view that our baseline economic forecast is for a severe but short recession in the first half of restrictions on movement because of the covid19 pandemic have led to a huge drop in consumer spending and a steep drop in output as many workers are unable to get to their jobs we expect a significant contraction in us real gdp and steep job losses over the next few months and a large increase in the unemployment rate in through mid2020 in the baseline forecast economic growth resumes in the third quarter as consumers start to spend again fiscal stimulus and extremely low interest rates support the recovery real gdp surpasses its prerecession peak in the second half of and growth is well above its longterm trend through the baseline forecast assumes that the federal open market committee keeps the federal funds rate in its current range of to into given the many unknowns and risks being heavily weighted to the downside our forwardlooking statements are subject to the risk that conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting if efforts to contain covid19 are unsuccessful and restrictions on movement last into the third quarter or beyond the recession would be much longer and much more severe ineffective fiscal stimulus or an extended delay in implementing it are also major downside risks the deeper the recession is and the longer it lasts the more it will damage consumer fundamentals and sentiment this could both prolong the recession andor make any recovery weaker similarly the recession could damage business fundamentals and an extended global recession due to covid19 would weaken the us recovery as a result the outbreak and its consequences including responsive measures to manage it have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect possibly materially on our business and financial performance by adversely affecting possibly materially the demand and profitability of our products and
