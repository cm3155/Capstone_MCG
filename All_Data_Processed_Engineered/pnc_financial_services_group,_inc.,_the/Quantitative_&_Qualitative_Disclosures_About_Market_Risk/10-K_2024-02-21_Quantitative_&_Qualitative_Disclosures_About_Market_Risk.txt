related to these revenue streams within the scope of asc topic revenue from contracts with customers use of estimates we prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported our most significant estimates pertain to the acl and our fair value measurements actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements cash cash equivalents and restricted cash cash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary source of liquidity certain cash balances within cash and due from banks on our consolidated balance sheet are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements investments we hold interests in various types of investments the accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to items such as ownership interest our plans for the investment and the nature of the investment debt securities debt securities are recorded on a tradedate basis we classify debt securities as either trading held to maturity or available for sale debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customerrelated trading activities are classified as trading securities are reported in the other assets line item on our consolidated balance sheet and are carried at fair value for debt securities classified as trading realized and unrealized gains and losses within our capital markets business are included in capital markets and advisory noninterest income other realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in other noninterest income we classify debt securities as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity and carry them at amortized cost less any allowance debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as securities available for sale and are carried at fair value unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in aoci net of income taxes we include all interest on debt securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities in net interest income using the constant effective yield method generally calculated over the contractual lives of the securities effective yields reflect either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition or for debt securities where an otti was recorded the effective interest rate determined based on improved cash flows subsequent to an impairment we compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis these securities gains and losses are included in other noninterest income on the consolidated income statement the cecl standard requires expected credit losses on both held to maturity and available for sale securities to be recognized through a valuation allowance acl instead of as a direct writedown to the amortized cost basis of the security an available for sale security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis if any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security if we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an impaired available for sale security before recovery of the amortized cost basis the credit loss is recorded as a direct writedown of the amortized cost basis credit losses on investment securities are recognized through the provision for credit losses on our consolidated income statement declines in the fair value of available for sale securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet we consider a security to be past due in terms of payment based on its contractual terms a security may be placed on nonaccrual with interest no longer recognized until received when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful as of december nonaccrual or past due heldtomaturity and availableforsale securities were immaterial the pnc financial services group inc form 10ka security may be partially or fully charged off against the allowance if it is determined to be uncollectible including for an available for sale security if we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis recoveries of previously chargedoff available for sale securities are recognized when received while recoveries on held to maturity securities are recognized when expected see the allowance for credit losses section of this note for further discussion regarding the methodologies used to determine the allowance for investment securities see note investment securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio and the related acl equity securities and partnership interests we account for equity securities equity investments private equity investments and investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated under one of the following methods we use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee under the equity method we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance when an equity investment experiences an otherthan temporary decline in value we record a loss on the investment we measure equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value at fair value through net income we do not consider contractual restrictions on the sale of an equity security when measuring fair value both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in noninterest income dividend income on these equity securities is included in other interest income on our consolidated income statement we generally use the practicability exception to fair value measurement for all other investments without a readily determinable fair value when we elect this alternative measurement method the investment is recorded at cost and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment if any plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer adjustments to fair value based on changes in observable price are recorded in other noninterest income these investments are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates impairment and the fair value is less than the carrying value the amount of the writedown is accounted for as a loss included in other noninterest income distributions received on these investments are included in other noninterest income investments described above are included in equity investments on our consolidated balance sheet private equity investments we report private equity investments which include direct investments in companies affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds at estimated fair value these estimates are based on available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution sale or liquidation of the investments fair values of publiclytraded direct investments are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to various discount factors arising from security level restrictions when appropriate the valuation procedures applied to direct investments and indirect investments are detailed in note fair value we include all private equity investments within equity investments on our consolidated balance sheet changes in fair value of private equity investments are recognized in other noninterest income we consolidate affiliated partnerships when we have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a vie the portion we do not own is reflected in noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet loans loans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff managements intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies the economic environment market conditions and the availability of government programs measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan loans that are days or more past due are considered delinquent the cares act credit reporting rules which required exceptions to this policy expired in the third quarter of as such delinquency status at december is being reported for all loans based on the contractual terms of each loan prior period amounts continue to be presented in accordance with the credit reporting rules under the cares act which required certain loans modified due to pandemicrelated hardships to not be reported as past due based on the contractual terms of the loan even when borrowers may not have made payments on their loans during the modification period loans held for investment excluding pcd loans are recorded at amortized cost basis unless we elect to measure these under the fair value option amortized cost basis represents principal amounts outstanding net of unearned income unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans premiums or discounts on purchased loans and chargeoffs amortized cost basis does not include accrued the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 95interest as we include accrued interest in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet interest on performing loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and recorded in interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method over the contractual life loan origination fees direct loan origination costs and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into net interest income using the constant effective yield method over the contractual life of the loan the processing fee received for loans originated through ppp lending under the cares act is deferred and accreted into net interest income using the effective yield method over the contractual life of the loan loans under the fair value option are reported at their fair value with any changes to fair value reported as noninterest income on the consolidated income statement and are excluded from measurement of alll in addition to originating loans we also acquire loans through the secondary loan market portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies certain acquired loans that have experienced a morethaninsignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination ie pcd are recognized at an amortized cost basis equal to their purchase price plus an alll measured at the acquisition date pnc considers a variety of factors in connection with the identification of morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality including but not limited to nonperforming status delinquency risk ratings and other qualitative factors that indicate deterioration in credit quality since origination subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are attributable at least in part to credit quality are recognized through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the alll subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded alll we consider a loan to be collateral dependent when we determine that substantially all of the expected cash flows will be generated from the operation or sale of the collateral underlying the loan or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we have elected to measure the loan at the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell if sale or foreclosure of the property is expected additionally we consider a loan to be collateral dependent when foreclosure or liquidation of the underlying collateral is probable on january we adopted asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures asu which eliminates the accounting guidance for tdrs and replaces tdrs with loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty or fdms fdms occur as a result of our loss mitigation activities a variety of solutions are offered to borrowers including loan modifications that may result in principal forgiveness interest rate reductions term extensions payment delays repayment plans or combinations thereof principal forgiveness includes principal and accrued interest forgiveness interest rate reductions include modifications where the interest rate is reduced andor interest is deferred term extensions extend the original contractual maturity date of the loan payment delays consist of modifications where we expect to collect contractual amounts due but that result in a delay in the receipt of payments specified under the original loan terms we generally consider payment delays to be insignificant when the delay is three months or less repayment plans are offered for some of our credit card and unsecured line of credit products which provide for a reduced payment and interest rate for a specific period of time additionally modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their obligations to us and those that enter into trial modifications fdms exclude loans held for sale and loans accounted for under the fair value option our disclosed fdm population also excludes government insured or guaranteed education loans as loss mitigation activities for these loans are either required by law or they are considered separate from pncs loss mitigation treatments commercial loans with an appraised value of collateral that exceeds the loan value loans with guarantor support and residential mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans are included in our disclosed population of fdms when those loan modifications are granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty fdms continue to be subject to our existing nonaccrual policies expected losses or recoveries on fdms have been factored into the alll estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this note refer to note loans and related allowance for credit losses for more information on fdms prior to the adoption of this asu a tdr was considered a loan whose terms had been restructured in a manner that granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a concession had been granted when we did not expect to collect all amounts due including original interest accrued at the original contract rate as a result of the restructuring or there was a delay in payment that was morethaninsignificant tdrs resulted from our loss mitigation activities and included rate reductions principal forgiveness postponementreduction of scheduled amortization and extensions which were intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral additionally tdrs also resulted from borrowers that had been discharged from personal liability through chapter bankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us in those situations where principal is forgiven the amount of such principal forgiveness was immediately charged off additionally for periods prior to the pnc financial services group inc form 10kpotential incremental losses or recoveries on tdrs had been factored into the alll estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this note once a loan became a tdr it would continue to be reported as a tdr until it was ultimately repaid in full the collateral was foreclosed upon or it fully charged off pnc excluded loans held for sale loans accounted for under the fair value option and certain government insured or guaranteed loans from our tdr population see the following for additional information related to loans including further discussion regarding our policies the methodologies and significant inputs used to determine the alll and additional details on the composition of our loan portfolio nonperforming loans and leases section of this note allowance for credit losses section of this note and note loans and related allowance for credit losses in this report nonperforming loans and leases the matrix that follows summarizes our policies for classifying certain loans as nonperforming loans andor discontinuing the accrual of loan interest income commercial loans classified as loans accounted for at amortized cost where nonperforming and accounted the loan is days or more past due for as nonaccrual the loan is rated substandard or worse due to the determination that full collection of principal and interest is not probable as demonstrated by the following conditions the collection of principal or interest is days or more past due reasonable doubt exists as to the certainty of the borrowers future debt service ability according to the terms of the credit arrangement regardless of whether days have passed or not the borrower has filed or will likely file for bankruptcy and it is not probable the borrower will be able to repay contractual payments due under the loan the bank advances additional funds to cover principal or interest we are in the process of liquidating a commercial borrower or we are pursuing remedies under a guarantee loans excluded from loans accounted for under the fair value option and full collection of principal and interest is not probable nonperforming classification but loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to sell held for sale and full collection of accounted for as nonaccrual principal and interest is not probable loans excluded from loans that are well secured and in the process of collection nonperforming classification and certain government insured or guaranteed loans where substantially all principal and interest is insured nonaccrual accounting commercial purchasing card assets that do not accrue interest consumer loans classified as loans accounted for at amortized cost where full collection of contractual principal and interest is not nonperforming and accounted deemed probable as demonstrated in the policies below for as nonaccrual the loan is days past due for home equity and installment loans and days past due for well secured residential real estate loans the loan had been modified and classified as a tdr prior to the adoption of asu the loan has been modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty and is not government insured or guaranteed the loan has been modified to defer prior payments in forbearance to the end of the loan term notification of bankruptcy has been received the bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan and the first lien mortgage loan is seriously stressed ie days or more past due other loans within the same borrower relationship have been placed on nonaccrual or chargeoffs have been taken on them the bank has ordered the repossession of nonreal estate collateral securing the loan or the bank has chargedoff the loan to the value of the collateral loans excluded from loans accounted for under the fair value option and full collection of principal and interest is not probable nonperforming classification but loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to sell held for sale and full collection of accounted for as nonaccrual principal and interest is not probable loans excluded from certain government insured or guaranteed loans where substantially all principal and interest is insured nonperforming classification and residential real estate loans that are well secured and in the process of collection nonaccrual accounting consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate or automobiles as permitted by regulatory guidance commercial we generally charge off commercial commercial and industrial commercial real estate and equipment lease financing nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan or portion thereof is uncollectible this determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans in making this determination we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern the past due status when the asset is not well secured the expected cash flows to repay the loan the value of the collateral and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform for commercial loans and leases less than a defined dollar threshold balances are generally charged off in full after days for loans and days for leases the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 97consumer we generally charge off secured consumer home equity residential real estate and automobile nonperforming loans to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if the fair value is lower than the amortized cost basis of the loan outstanding and the delinquency of the loan combined with other risk factors such as bankruptcy or lien position indicates that the loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible as per our historical experience these nonperforming loans would also be charged off when the collateral has been repossessed we charge off secured consumer loans no later than days past due most consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by automobiles or residential real estate are charged off once they have reached days past due for secured collateral dependent loans collateral values are updated at least annually and subsequent declines in collateral values are charged off resulting in incremental provision for credit loss subsequent increases in collateral values may be reflected as an adjustment to the alll to reflect the expectation of recoveries in an amount greater than previously expected limited to amounts previously chargedoff accounting for nonperforming assets and leases and other nonaccrual loans for nonaccrual loans interest income accrual and deferred feecost recognition is discontinued additionally depending on whether the accrued interest has been incorporated into the acl estimates as discussed in the accrued interest section of this note the accrued and uncollected interest is either reversed through net interest income if a cecl reserve is not maintained for accrued interest or charged off against the allowance if a cecl reserve is maintained for accrued interest except for credit cards where we reverse any accrued interest through net interest income at the time of a chargeoff as per industry standard practice nonaccrual loans that are also collateral dependent may be charged off to reduce the basis to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if payment is received on a nonaccrual loan generally the payment is first applied to the remaining principal balance payments are then applied to recover any chargedoff amounts related to the loan finally if both the principal balance and any chargeoffs have been recovered then the payment will be recorded as interest income for certain consumer loans the receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income on a cash basis cash basis income recognition is applied if a loans amortized cost basis is deemed fully collectible and the loan has performed for at least six months for tdrs prior to the adoption of asu payments were applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan was deemed nonperforming tdrs were generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans however after a reasonable period of time generally six months in which the loan performed under restructured terms and met other performance indicators it was returned to performingaccruing status tdrs resulting from i borrowers that had been discharged from personal liability through chapter bankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and ii borrowers that were not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms were not returned to accruing status for fdms payments are applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan is deemed nonperforming consumer loans modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans if they are not government insured or guaranteed commercial loans modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans subject to the banks policies for nonperforming loans and leases fdms may remain on accruing status if the bank expects to collect all contractual principal and interest due under the loan and the borrower remains current collateral coverage guarantor andor sponsor support and debt service coverage are factors that may be considered in the accruing status of an fdm loan fdm loans classified as nonperforming and nonaccrual loans may return to accruing status after a reasonable period of time generally six months in which the loan performs under modified terms and meets other performance indicators this return to accruing status demonstrates that the bank expects to collect all of the loans remaining contractual principal and interest loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulting from i borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and ii borrowers that are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the modified terms are not returned to accrual status other nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accruing status until the borrower has performed in accordance with the loans contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least six months the period of time which was determined to demonstrate the expected collectability of the loans remaining contractual principal and interest nonaccrual loans with partially chargedoff principal may return to accruing status if the loan performs after a reasonable period of time generally six months and the loan meets other performance indicators when a nonperforming loan is returned to accruing status it is then considered a performing loan nonaccrual loans with fully chargedoff principal are prohibited from returning to accruing status foreclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deedinlieu of foreclosure oreo comprises principally residential and commercial real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations after obtaining a foreclosure judgment or in some jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments the property will be sold when we are awarded title or completion of deedinlieu of foreclosure we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is the pnc financial services group inc form 10kinitially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell based upon the estimated fair value less cost to sell the amortized cost basis of the loan is adjusted and a chargeoffrecovery is recognized to the alll we estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals or sales agreements with third parties subsequently foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at the acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in other noninterest expense for certain mortgage loans that have a government guarantee we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure the receivable is measured based on the loan balance inclusive of principal and interest that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor see note loans and related allowance for credit losses for additional information on fdms nonperforming assets and credit quality indicators related to our loan portfolio allowance for credit losses our acl is based on historical loss experience current borrower risk characteristics current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors we maintain the acl at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities loans equipment finance leases other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date the remaining contractual term of assets in scope of cecl is estimated considering contractual maturity dates prepayment expectations utilization or draw expectations and any contractually embedded extension options that do not allow us to unilaterally cancel the extension options for products without a fixed contractual maturity date eg credit cards we rely on historical payment behavior to determine the length of the paydown or default time period we estimate expected losses on a pooled basis using a combination of i the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period ii a period of reversion to longrun average expected losses where applicable and iii the longrun average expected losses for the remaining estimated contractual term for all assets and unfunded lending related commitments in the scope of cecl the acl also includes individually assessed reserves and qualitative reserves as applicable we use forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period for this purpose we use forecasted scenarios produced by pncs economics team which are designed to reflect potential trajectories of the business cycles and their related estimated probabilities the forecast length that we have currently determined to be reasonable and supportable is three years as noted in the methodology discussions that follow forwardlooking information is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates such forwardlooking information includes forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables which are estimated using quantitative macroeconomic models analysis from pnc economists and management judgment the reversion period is used to bridge our threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period and the longrun average expected credit losses we consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period such as contractual maturity of the asset observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the longrun average period the reversion period is typically one to three years if not immediate the longrun average expected credit losses are derived from longrun historical credit loss information adjusted for the credit quality of the current portfolio and therefore do not consider current and forecasted economic conditions see the following sections related to investment securities loans and leases unfunded lending related commitments and other financial assets for details about specific reserve methodologies allowance for investment securities a significant portion of our investment securities are issued or guaranteed by either the us government us treasury or a government entity or a governmentsponsored agency fnma or fhlmc taking into consideration historical information and current and forecasted conditions we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these securities investment securities that are not issued or guaranteed by the us government or a governmentsponsored agency consist of both securitized products such as nonagency mortgage and assetbacked securities as well as nonsecuritized products such as corporate and municipal debt securities a discounted cash flow approach is primarily used to determine the amount of the allowance required the estimates of expected cash flows are determined using macroeconomic sensitive models taking into consideration the reasonable and supportable forecast period and scenarios discussed above additional factors unique to a specific security may also be taken into consideration when estimating expected cash flows the cash flows expected to be collected after considering expected prepayments are discounted at the effective interest rate for an availableforsale security the amount of the allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its estimated fair value the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 99see note investment securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio allowance for loan and lease losses our pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of risk parameters such as pd lgd ead and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan loan segment or lease we also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated contractual term in our expected loss estimates we use historical credit loss information current borrower risk characteristics and forecasted economic variables for the reasonable and supportable forecast period coupled with analytical methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan loan segment or lease pd lgd and ead parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the longrun average period and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario each scenario is then weighted to determine our total estimated loss the following matrix provides key credit risk characteristics that we use to estimate these risk parameters loan class probability of

above which is the period between the end of the forecast period and when losses are estimated to have completely reverted to the longrun average once we have developed a combined estimate of credit losses ie for the forecast period reversion period and longrun average under each of the forecasted scenarios we produce a probabilityweighted credit loss estimate in addition we add or deduct any qualitative components and other adjustments such as individually assessed loans to produce the alll see the individually assessed component and qualitative component discussions that follow in this note for additional information about those adjustments discounted cash flow prior to january we used a discounted cash flow methodology for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes in addition to our tdr portfolios we determined effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for estimated prepayments changes in the alll due to the impact of the passage of time under the discounted cash flow estimate were recognized through the provision for credit losses effective january we discontinued our use of a discounted cash flow methodology and we now use a pooled expected loss methodology based upon the quantification of risk parameters such as pd lgd and ead for a loan or loan segment individually assessed component loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows for commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold reserves are based on an analysis of the present value of the loans expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold are reserved for under a pooled basis as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics for consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent chargeoff and alll related to recovery of amounts previously charged off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell qualitative component while our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors the acl also accounts for factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves such qualitative factors may include but are not limited to industry concentrations and conditions changes in market conditions including regulatory and legal requirements

securities the allowance for pcd loans or securities is determined at the time of acquisition as the estimated expected credit loss of the outstanding balance or par value based on the methodologies described previously for loans and securities in accordance with cecl the allowance recognized at acquisition is added to the acquisition date purchase price to determine the assets amortized cost basis allowance for unfunded lending related commitments we maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on offbalance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable eg unfunded loan commitments letters of credit and certain financial guarantees at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures other than the estimation of the probability of funding this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for pooled loans and leases see the allowance for loan and lease losses section of this note for the key credit risk characteristics for unfunded lending related commitments the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated income statement see note loans and related allowance for credit losses for additional information about this allowance allowance for other financial assets we determine the allowance for other financial assets eg trade receivables servicing advances on pncowned loans and balances with banks considering historical loss information and other available indicators in certain cases where there are no historical current or forecast indicators of an expected credit loss we may estimate the reserve to be close to zero as of december and december the allowance for other financial assets was immaterial loans held for sale we designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell them at the time of designation to held for sale any acl is reversed and a valuation allowance for the shortfall between the amortized cost basis and the net realizable value is recognized excluding the amounts already charged off similarly when loans are no longer considered held for sale the valuation allowance net of writedowns is reversed and an allowance for credit losses is established excluding the amounts already charged off writedowns on loans held for sale if required are recorded as chargeoffs through the valuation allowance adjustments to the valuation allowance on held for sale loans are recognized in other noninterest income we have elected to account for certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value the changes in the fair value of commercial and residential mortgage loans are measured and recorded within residential and commercial mortgage within noninterest income each period see note fair value for additional information the pnc financial services group inc form 10kinterest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loans contractual interest rate in certain circumstances loans designated as held for sale may be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy we transfer these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value however any loans originated or purchased for the held for sale portfolio and for which the fair value option has been elected remain at fair value for the life of the loan loan sales loan securitizations and retained interests we recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met we have sold mortgage and other loans through securitization transactions in a securitization financial assets are transferred into trusts or to spes in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from us in a securitization the trust or spe issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust the senior classes of the assetbacked securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the time of issuance these ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lowerrated subordinated classes of assetbacked securities as well as subordinated or residual interests in certain cases we may retain a portion or all of the securities issued interest only strips one or more subordinated tranches servicing rights and in some cases cash reserve accounts if sale accounting is achieved securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in noninterest income at the time of initial sale gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale we generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates interest rates prepayment speeds credit losses and servicing costs if applicable with the exception of loan sales to certain us governmentchartered entities our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the retained interests we originate sell and service commercial mortgage loans under the fnma dus program under the provisions of the dus program we participate in a losssharing arrangement with fnma when we are obligated for losssharing or recourse our policy is to record such

limited liability company or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets generally that either does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entitys most significant economic activities through those voting rights or similar rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support a vie often holds financial assets including loans or receivables real estate or other property vies are assessed for consolidation under asc consolidation when we hold a variable interest in these entities we consolidate a vie if we are its primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria i has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie upon consolidation of a vie we recognize all of the vies assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests on

mortgage servicing rights we provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential loans these contracts are either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale all acquired or originated servicing rights are initially measured at fair value fair value is based on the present value of the expected future net cash flows including assumptions as to deposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings discount rates estimated prepayment speeds and estimated servicing costs the pnc financial

note fair value for additional information goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level on the acquisition date a reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment at least annually in the fourth quarter management performs the goodwill impairment test at a reporting unit level the goodwill impairment test may also be performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date when such events or circumstances may indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value examples of events or circumstances that are considered for more frequent goodwill impairment testing include but are not limited to changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations and other relevant pnc or reporting unit specific events when performing a goodwill impairment test pnc may first perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is morelikelythan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after considering all relevant events and circumstances pnc determines it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative impairment test is not necessary if pnc elects to bypass the qualitative analysis or concludes via qualitative analysis that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit which is compared to its carrying amount the fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flows andor market comparability methodologies if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting units fair value the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and

buildings over an estimated useful life of up to years we amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to years or the respective lease terms whichever is shorter we purchase as well as internally develop and customize certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions software development costs incurred in the planning and postdevelopment project stages are charged to noninterest expense costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces installation coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straightline method over periods generally ranging from one to years implementation costs of software hosting arrangements are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the associated arrangement including extension options we are reasonably certain to exercise on a straightline basis we review the remaining useful lives and carrying values of premises and equipment to determine

date of subsequent reissue the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the firstin firstout basis earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the twoclass method to determine income attributable to common shareholders unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the twoclass method distributed dividends and dividend equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce the amount of income attributable to common shareholders in a period with a loss no allocation will be made to the participating securities as they do not have a contractual obligation to absorb losses income attributable to common shareholders is then divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or the twoclass method for the diluted calculation we increase the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock from the beginning of the year or date of issuance if later and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method these adjustments to the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share for periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations any potential dilutive shares will be antidilutive in this scenario no potential dilutive shares will be included in the continuing operations discontinued operations or total earnings per common share calculations even if overall net income is reported see note earnings per share for additional information fair value of financial instruments the fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in note fair value derivative instruments and hedging activities we use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market primarily interest rate and credit risks inherent in our business activities as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities we manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures we recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship for all other derivatives changes in fair value are recognized in earnings the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 105we utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return or general rights to reclaim cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges we designate the hedging instrument based on the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation we formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objective and strategy before undertaking an accounting hedge to qualify for hedge accounting the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship in addition a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged for accounting hedge relationships we formally assess both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item if it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued we assess effectiveness using statistical regression analysis where the critical terms of the derivative and hedged item match effectiveness may be assessed qualitatively for derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges ie hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk such as changes in benchmark interest rates changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk to the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item the difference is reflected in the consolidated income statement in the same income statement line as the hedged item for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges ie hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows the gain or loss on derivatives is reported as a component of aoci and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect earnings and recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows for derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of aoci we discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised or the derivative is dedesignated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or for a cash flow hedge it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period we purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative for financial instruments not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings we assess at inception of the transaction if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative if the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and meets the definition of a derivative the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value we enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale we also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans these commitments are accounted for as freestanding derivatives which are recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in noninterest income see note financial derivatives for additional information income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment thus at the enactment date deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in income tax expense the recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income we establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized based upon all available positive and negative evidence we have elected to apply the proportional amortization method to our qualifying lihtc and nmtc equity investments

price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date and is determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants the fair value hierarchy established by gaap requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are level fair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities level assets and liabilities may include debt securities equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market and certain us treasury securities that are actively traded in overthecounter markets level fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly the majority of level assets and liabilities include debt securities and listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active and certain debt and equity securities and overthecounter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable inputs level fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation we characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information with reasonably narrow bidask spreads and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information wide bidask spreads a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums yields or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance or any combination of the above factors we also consider nonperformance risks including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value assets and liabilities measured at fair value by their nature result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets and liabilities classified within level inherently require the use of various assumptions estimates and judgments when measuring their fair value as observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of level assets and liabilities we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques these techniques include the use of a variety of inputs assumptions including credit quality liquidity interest rates or other relevant inputs across the entire population of our level assets the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 141and liabilities changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions either an increase or a decrease in any of these areas underlying our estimates may have resulted in a significant increasedecrease in the level fair value measurement of a particular asset andor liability from period to period any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes our model risk management group reviews significant models on at least an annual basis in addition the valuation committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation reviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis residential mortgage loans held for sale we account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis the election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices where available prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants the prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans these adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans accordingly the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as level commercial mortgage loans held for sale we account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value we determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans for loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained the fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows which is an unobservable input this adjustment is not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in the input to the fair value of the loans accordingly commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies are classified as level valuation assumptions may include observable inputs based on the benchmark interest rate swap curve whole loan sales and agency sales transactions the significant unobservable input for commercial mortgage loans held for sale excluding those to be sold to agencies is managements assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate the spread over the benchmark curve includes managements assumptions of the impact of credit and liquidity risk significant increases decreases in the spread applied to the benchmark would have resulted in a significantly lower higher asset value the wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio based on the significance of the unobservable input we classified this portfolio as level securities available for sale and trading securities securities accounted for at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios we primarily use prices obtained from pricing services dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities the majority of securities were priced by third party vendors the thirdparty vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions we monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews including detailed reviews of the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities and through price validation testing securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote which are also subject to price validation testing price validation testing is performed independent of the risktaking function and involves corroborating the prices received from thirdparty vendors and dealers with prices from another third party or through other sources such as internal valuations or sales of similar securities security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security securities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after considering the activity level in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value when a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical security this price is used to determine fair value and the security is classified within level of the hierarchy level securities include us treasury securities when a quoted price in an active market for the identical security is not available fair value is estimated using either an alternative market approach such as a recent trade or matrix pricing or an income approach such as a discounted cash flow pricing model if the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on market observable information then the security is classified within level of the hierarchy level securities include agency debt securities agency residential mortgagebacked securities agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities certain nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities the pnc financial services group inc form 10kcollateralized by nonmortgagerelated corporate and consumer loans and other debt securities level securities are predominantly priced by third parties either by a pricing vendor or dealer in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation securities are classified within level of the hierarchy securities classified as level consist primarily of nonagency residential mortgagebacked and asset backed securities collateralized by first and secondlien residential mortgage loans fair value for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing obtained from thirdparty vendors in some cases fair value is estimated using a dealer quote by reference to prices of securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar securities market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency as a result these securities are generally valued by the thirdparty vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable market activity where available significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions default rate and loss severity and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions significant increases decreases in any of those assumptions in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement certain infrequently traded debt securities within other debt securities available for sale and trading securities are also classified in level and are included in the insignificant level assets net of liabilities line item in table the significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk these inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security significant increases decreases in credit andor liquidity risk could have resulted in a significantly lower higher fair value estimate loans loans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans these loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as level however similar to residential mortgage loans held for sale if these loans are repurchased and unsalable they are classified as level in addition repurchased va loans where only a portion of the principal will be reimbursed are classified as level the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation based on our historical loss rate we have elected to account for certain home equity lines of credit at fair value these loans are classified as level significant inputs to the valuation of these loans include credit and liquidity discount cumulative default rate loss severity and gross discount rate and are deemed representative of current market conditions significant increases decreases in any of these assumptions would have resulted in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement equity investments equity investments includes money market mutual funds as well as direct and indirect private equity investments money market mutual funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities and classified within level of the hierarchy the valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and the longterm nature of such investments various valuation techniques are used for direct investments including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity independent appraisals anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction a multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most significant unobservable input used in such calculation significant decreases increases in the multiple of earnings could have resulted in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement generally direct equity investments are classified as level indirect investments are not redeemable however we receive distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee which we expect to occur over the next years we value indirect investments in private equity funds using the nav practical expedient as provided in the financial statements that we receive from fund managers due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied adjustments to the managerprovided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund indirect investments valued using nav are not classified in the fair value hierarchy mortgage servicing rights msrs msrs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis assumptions incorporated into the msrs valuation model reflect managements best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the msrs although sales of msrs do occur and can offer some market insight msrs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available residential msrs the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates spread over the benchmark curve and other factors due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs residential msrs are classified as level the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential msrs are constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve significant increases the pnc financial services group inc form 10k 143decreases in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would have resulted in lower higher fair market value of residential msrs as a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential msrs fair value we obtained opinions of value from independent brokers these brokers provided a range bps based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions we compare our internallydeveloped residential msrs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers if our residential msrs fair value falls outside of the brokers ranges management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted for the periods presented our residential msrs value did not fall outside of the brokers ranges commercial msrs the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates discount rates and other factors due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing commercial msrs are classified as level significant increases decreases in constant prepayment rates and discount rates would have resulted in significantly lower higher commercial msr value determined based on current market conditions and expectations financial derivatives exchangetraded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as level the majority of derivatives that we enter

financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market primarily interest rate and credit risks inherent in our business activities as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities we manage these risks as part of our overall asset and liability management process and through our credit policies and procedures derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not recorded on the balance sheet the notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract the underlying is a referenced interest rate security price credit spread or other index residential and

generally utilize a net presentation on the consolidated balance sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements the master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default the master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either partys net position collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the positions with the counterparty as of the preceding day collateral representing initial margin which is based on potential future exposure may also be required to be exchanged in certain cases minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is exchanged any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted when appropriate against the applicable derivative fair values on the consolidated balance sheet however the fair value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the net presentation on the consolidated balance sheet in order for derivative instruments under a master netting agreement to be eligible for closeout netting under gaap we must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well founded basis that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable upon an event of default including upon an event of bankruptcy insolvency or a similar proceeding of the counterparty enforceability is evidenced by a legal opinion that supports with sufficient confidence the enforceability
