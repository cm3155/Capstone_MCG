the integration of the acquired business anticipated benefits such as cost savings from synergies or strategic gains from being able to offer enhanced product sets may take longer or require greater resources to achieve in some cases it may prove impossible to realize them in their entirety the success of an acquisition generally is at least partially dependent on our ability to retain and expand

hard to predict the results of such legal proceedings it may also be hard to anticipate what legal proceedings may be started following an acquisition table end our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration depends in part on the information we can gather with respect to the business we are

an acquired business an acquired companys financial and business information and data may not be maintained at the level of detail or comprehensiveness to meet all of our postacquisition needs our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory issues including delays in obtaining required approvals our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted as well by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit systemic risk and the potential for a financial institution to become too big to fail our business and financial performance could be adversely affected directly or indirectly by disasters natural or otherwise by terrorist activities or by international hostilities neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters whether caused naturally or by human conduct pandemics terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted however these occurrences could adversely impact us for example by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course also their impact on our borrowers depositors other customers suppliers or other counterparties could result in indirect adverse effects on us other indirect adverse consequences from disasters pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities could result from impacts to the financial markets the economy in general or in any particular region or key parts of the infrastructure such as the power grid on which we and our customers rely these types of indirect effects whether specific to our counterparties or more generally applicable could lead for example to an increase in delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses they could also cause a reduction in demand for lending or other services that we provide to the extent that climate change increases the frequency or severity of adverse weather conditions the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or our customers would be worse our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning this includes our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that might occur the adverse impact of disasters pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with many of which we depend on but have limited or no control over
