youve seen we had a strong second quarter and we generated billion in net income or diluted earnings per share our results included a gain on a portion of our visa class b shares which was substantially offset by other items in the quarter including a securities repositioning robs going to provide more details on that visa gain financial results and outlook in a second but ill highlight a few items first off net interest income has moved past its trough and both nii and nim grew in the quarter and by the way this would have occurred independent of the million impact that we got from the securities repositioning importantly we are on a growth trajectory towards expected record nii in we continue to add new customers and see strong business momentum across our franchise particularly in the new and expansion markets dda growth accelerated in our branches and we continue to add new corporate and commercial banking clients above historical rates in our retail business we launched our first new credit card in several years pnc cash unlimited a highly competitive card that offers back on all purchases we plan to launch several new cards in the months and year ahead average deposits held relatively flat to the first quarter levels a little bit ahead of our expectations and our expenses remained wellcontrolled and we generated positive operating leverage during the second quarter robs going to touch on this in a minute but we have increased our continuous improvement program target for as expense discipline remains a top priority the credit environment continues to play out as weve expected including an increase in chargeoffs within the cre office portfolio where we remain adequately reserved outside of cre office credit quality remains the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 relatively stable finally we further strengthened our capital levels during the quarter our strong balance sheet allows us to continue supporting our customers and communities investing in our business and people and delivering returns for shareholders our financial strength and stability are also reflected in the latest results from the feds stress test in which we maintained our stress capital buffer at the regulatory minimum of and importantly for the second year in a row pnc has had the lowest starttotrough capital depletion in our peer group further demonstrating our bestin class resiliency with this in mind our board recently approved an increase in quarterly stock dividend by in summary we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are wellpositioned to drive further growth and expansion into and beyond before i turn it over to rob as always i just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers and with that ill turn it over to rob to take you through the quarter rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average linked quarter basis loans of billion were stable investment securities increased billion or and our cash balances at the federal reserve were billion a decrease of billion or primarily reflecting the deployment of cash into higher yielding securities deposit balances averaged billion a decline of billion or less than due to a seasonal decline in corporate balances borrowed funds increased billion or and were of total liabilities at quarterend aoci was negative billion and improved million compared with march our tangible book value increased to per common share a increase linked quarter and a increase compared to the same period a year ago we remain wellcapitalized and our estimated cet1 ratio increased to as of june regarding the basel iii endgame we expect the inclusion of aoci in the final rule and our cet1 ratio with the impact of aoci would be and while we recognize the likelihood of changes to certain other aspects of the basel iii endgame npr under the currently proposed capital rules our estimated fully phasedin expanded risk based cet1 ratio would be approximately we continue to be wellpositioned with capital flexibility we returned roughly million of capital to shareholders during the quarter which included million in common dividends and million of share repurchases and as bill just mentioned our board recently approved a increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to per share our recent ccar results underscored the strength of our balance sheet and as previously announced our current stress capital buffer remains at the regulatory minimum of for the fourquarter period beginning in october slide shows our loans in more detail compared to the first quarter average loan balances were stable commercial loans were essentially flat as utilization remains well below both the prepandemic historical average of roughly and the second quarter level of importantly we continue to grow customer relationships and cib loan commitments increased during the second quarter although the direction of the nearterm economy remains uncertain capex to sales levels and inventory growth rates remain below historical averages both of which are typically leading indicators of eventual commercial loan growth average consumer loans declined approximately million or less than driven by lower residential the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 real estate and home equity loan balances and the yield on total loans increased basis points to in the second quarter slide details our investment security and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion increased billion or reflecting the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding securities primarily us treasuries the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to driven by higher rates on new purchases as of june the securities portfolio duration was years during the second quarter our forward starting swaps increased to billion with the addition of these swaps weve locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing through at a level that is approximately basis points higher than maturities the total weighted average receive fixed rate of our swap portfolio including the forward starters increased basis points to and the duration of the portfolio was years slide highlights the securities repositioning we executed during the second quarter we sold securities with a book value of billion and a market value of billion we recognized a million loss on the sale and reinvested the billion of proceeds into securities with yields approximately basis points higher than the securities sold the repositioning is expected to benefit our net interest income by million in with roughly million of that being realized in the second quarter and the estimated earnback period for this transaction is less than years turning to slide we expect considerable runoff of lowyielding securities and swaps through the end of which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher yielding assets providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income accumulated other comprehensive income improved to negative billion on june compared to negative billion on march the improvement was primarily due to the securities repositioning aoci will continue to accrete back as our securities and swaps mature resulting in further growth to tangible book value slide covers our deposits in more detail average deposits declined billion or reflecting seasonally lower corporate balances regarding mix consolidated noninterestbearing deposits were of total deposits in the second quarter down less than percentage point from the first quarter additionally average noninterest bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline in the second quarter of since the fed began raising rates in which gives us confidence that the noninterestbearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized and our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased by only basis point during the second quarter to we believe our rate paid on deposits is approaching its peak level but we do expect some potential drift higher as interest rates remain elevated turning to the income statement and as bill mentioned there were several significant items in the quarter and i want to provide a bit more detail taken together these significant items have a minimal impact to our earnings per share totaling to a net eps benefit of as we previously disclosed we participated in the visa exchange program allowing us to monetize of our visa class b1 shares and convert our remaining holdings to million visa class b2 shares through the exchange we recognized a million pretax gain in addition we had significant items that occurred in the second quarter that largely offset the gain and they are as follows first as i mentioned earlier we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio and through the sale of certain lowyielding securities recognized a million loss second we recorded a negative million visa derivative fair value adjustment associated with visa class b2 shares primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution and lastly we recognized a million pnc foundation contribution expense the foundation supports our communities in early childhood education the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 turning to slide we highlight our income statement trends second quarter net income was billion or per share total revenue of billion increased million or compared to the first quarter of net interest income grew by million or in the second quarter notably this is the first time nii has increased in six quarters marking the beginning of an expected upward trajectory and our net interest margin was an increase of basis points noninterest income increased million or and included million of the significant items i previously detailed noninterest expense of billion increased million or and included the million foundation contribution expense notably we generated positive operating leverage in both the linked quarter and yearoveryear comparisons provision was million in the second quarter reflecting portfolio activity and our effective tax rate was turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends second quarter revenue was up million or driven by higher noninterest income and net interest income net interest income of billion increased million or driven by higher yields on interestearning assets fee income was billion and increased million or linked quarter looking at the detail asset management and brokerage noninterest income was stable linked quarter as the benefit of higher average equity markets was offset by lower annuity sales due to the elevated first quarter activity capital markets and advisory fees increased million or driven by higher ma advisory activity and loan syndications partially offset by lower underwriting fees card and cash management increased million or reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and higher treasury management fees mortgage revenue declined million or primarily due to lower residential mortgage activity other noninterest income of million increased million and included million related to this quarters significant items turning to slide our noninterest expense of billion was well controlled increasing by only million or expenses for the second quarter included the million contribution to the pnc foundation while the first quarter of included million fdic special assessment importantly noninterest expense excluding the foundation contribution declined million or compared with the second quarter of notably personnel declined as a result of the workforce reduction actions we took last year as bill mentioned we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts at the beginning of the year we set a continuous improvement program goal of million recently we have identified initiatives that support increasing our cip by an additional million raising our full year target to million as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by an individual secured loan within our assetbased lending business total delinquencies of billion were stable with march net loan chargeoffs were million in the second quarter and included million of net chargeoffs related to our cre office portfolio and our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on june stable with march slide provides more detail on our cre office credit metrics cre office npls were stable in the second quarter as chargeoffs and paydowns offset inflows to nonperforming loans and the migration of criticized loans to nonperforming status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the challenges inherent to this portfolio as the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 expected net loan chargeoffs within the cre office portfolio increased and totaled million in the second quarter ultimately we expect additional chargeoffs on this portfolio the size of which will vary quartertoquarter given the nature of the loans as of june our reserves on the office portfolio were of total office loans and inside of that on the multitenant portfolio accordingly we believe were adequately reserved importantly we continue to manage our exposure down and as a result our balances declined or approximately million linked quarter in summary pnc posted a solid second quarter and were well positioned for the second half of the year regarding our view of the overall economy were expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the year resulting in real gdp growth of approximately in and unemployment to increase modestly to slightly above by yearend we expect the fed to cut rates two times in with a 25basispoint decrease in september and another in december looking at the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of we expect average loans to be stable net interest income to be up to fee income to be up to other noninterest income to be in the range of million and million excluding visa and securities activity we expect core noninterest expense to be up to we expect third quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million regarding our full year guidance for ease of comparability to prior guidance we exclude the first quarter fdic special assessment as well as the second quarter visa gain and other significant items considering our reported first half operating results third quarter expectations and current economic forecast our full year guidance is as follows for the full year compared to full year we expect average loans to be down less than which equates to nominal loan growth in the second half of we recognize the potential for greater loan growth and should that occur itll be accretive to our full year average despite lower expected loan volumes we expect full year nii to be at the better end of our previous expectations or down approximately we expect our securities repositioning and betterthanexpected deposit dynamics to offset the impact of the lowerthan expected loan volume we expect noninterest income to be up to slightly lower than our previous guidance due to continued softness in mortgage activity and to a lesser extent loanrelated capital markets fees as a result total revenue is expected to be down to and inside the range of our previous guidance we now expect core noninterest expense to be down approximately versus our previous guidance of stable in part due to our increased cip target and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first questions come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so on nii i know you guided to the upper end of the range even though youve got slower loan growth clearly due to your nim improving at least thats one driver theres others as well i just wanted to understand how youre thinking about the securities restructuring from here is this something that you would consider continuing or is it we should look at it as a oneoff from using the visa gains and i ask just from the context of trying to think through nim trajectory from here thanks william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc you should think of it as a oneoff i mean you never say never and i dont know what the future holds but practically at this point we dont have to do any restructuring on anything to hit that stated goal of the record nii robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and we dont have any plans to do that william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then could you speak to how youre thinking about deposit pricing and levels i mean clearly there was taxrelated outflows and things like that this quarter and with loan growth being muted should we be anticipating deposits stable to down or are you going to out there trying to get deposit growth just again asking from the context of how we should think about deposit pricing as we work through our models thanks so much robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 yeah sure sure betsy i would say the short answer to that is stable to down is our expectation with an emphasis on stable things have really stabilized yearoveryear as you know so our expectation is some downward drift but not anywhere near the level that weve seen in the last couple of years betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thanks so much appreciate it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your questions john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on your nii outlook its good to hear the nii inflection and the confidence there excluding the million benefit from the securities repositioning in the back half of this year i mean it appears that the underlying nii run rate for the back half was guided a bit lower is that mainly loan growth thats the driver i mean if you could just talk through that a little bit in terms of the factors impacting that run rate indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it wasnt if you backed out the restructuring that would still be higher and we did that while muting our loan growth assumption and we did that because we kind of just got tired of saying that hey loan growth is going to come at some point so we took it out of the forecast if it shows up well benefit like everybody else the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and i think thats an important point thats the big difference in this quarter we changed our guidance for average loans to be up or approximately for the year john to as you can see now down less than we dont control that theres a basis for some loan growth in the second half of the year but the important point is weve taken it out of our guidance and our nii improves to the better end of the previous guidance not just due to the securities restructuring but also the positive deposit dynamics and so forth john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right no thanks for the clarification that helps robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure john pancari q analyst evercore isi and then just separately on the capital on the capital front clearly the aoci benefit from the securities repositioning is certainly noted how does that how do you feel now in terms of the pace of buybacks as you look out just given where you stand now on cet1 and from a fully phasedin how does that make you feel about the pace of buybacks here could it remain at the million pace per quarter or possibly accelerate robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean right now were on pace and we continue to we expect to continue the pace that weve been on for the first couple of quarters and as you know the new rules are still in flux so theres not finalization there and then beyond that i think a driver will be what happens with loan growth which would be a factor in terms of that being our highest and best use of our capital william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but thatll be a factor in terms of deciding on buybacks but the important part is that we are buying back shares william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think john just on buybacks i mean at some point i got to believe loan growth comes back but to the extent it doesnt were generating a lot of capital obviously in excess of our dividend and well face that question if were not using that capital for loan growth should we accelerate deployment and buybacks were not there yet but that happens down the road if loan growth doesnt materialize because were generating a lot of capital the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thats helpful thanks bill operator thank you our next questions come from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just going back to william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning going back to slide i presume that the stabilization in deposit rate paid which is quite notable as part of the upgrade of the core nii guide even without the restructuring and you answered rob betsys question i gather on a balances standpoint robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc but perhaps give us a sense on how you think deposit rate paid will trend from here and maybe robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc under the scenario of rates staying where we are versus the scenario of what the forward curve is pricing and how quickly you may be able to reprice robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure our plan so slide is a good slide and it clearly shows a decline in the increase of the rate paid the short answer to one of your questions there is we do expect the rates paid to drift up a little bit but in contrast more like a handful of basis points versus the contrast to the previous quarters where you see basis points or basis points and even basis points in the recent quarters so its slowed down considerably thats our expectation in the shortterm erika when we get into rate cuts well see well be able to move pretty quickly on the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 the high rates paid on commercial and wealth but we still do have these interestbearing consumer deposits that are below market that will grind higher so thats something that weve talked about before and just something that well need to keep our eye on erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question refers back to slide in terms of the forward starters when i look back at your 10q disclosure it seems like youre largely neutral to interest rates and i know that you and bill have talked a lot about the different factors that drive the inflection point in the nike swoosh im wondering if the addition of the william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc billion in forward starters with the receive fixed of does that impact the magnitude of the swoosh for william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats a good question robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well my answer to that would not necessarily be the magnitude but the certainty william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc so essentially what weve done is locked in some of the swoosh william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah probably basis points ago one of the issues of course when everybody talks about fixed rate asset repricing is what is it repriced to and of course therefore we are exposed to whatever that fiveyear rate is a year and two out and those forward starting swaps simply at a very opportunistic point locked in materially higher rates than where we are today to robs point that just locks in the certainty of what well be able to produce on a goforward basis erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 no got it and then bill i think thats such a good point because i think when people are thinking of fixed asset repricing sometimes they misthink about the as opposed to whatever it could be at right by the end of next year and to that to your point william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc youve locked in the certainty okay thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question rob i was hoping you could maybe touch on sort of major fee components in light of the softer expectation i mean it sounds like its just a or mostly a function of mortgage which sort of is what it is robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co but just curious to hear sort of what do you think is going well what will need heavier lift that kind of thing robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its mostly a refinement scott so for the full year guide around the fees we lowered our expectations of increase as you know from up to to up to so still up and a small shift most of that coming from continued softness in mortgage which we expect to be on the continue in the balance half or second half of the year little bit less than what we were expecting to a lesser extent tied to the reduced loan guidance we do have loanrelated fees within our capital markets segment think loan syndication so generally speaking if theres fewer loans therell be fewer loan syndication fees so thats just a direct correlation there to that guide and again we could see loan growth and if thats the case then those fees would come back but thats the general thinking everything else on schedule so to speak r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you rob and then i wanted to ask a little bit of a kind of finepointed one on loan growth i think bill in your sort of prepared remarks you noted the introduction of your first new credit card in a while as well as plans to introduce more the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co can you sort of contextualize your aspirations for that business and the sort of the path to get there over time william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean basically we want to have our fair share of consumer lending products with the clients we serve in our traditional dda and other products and we dont today were there in home equity were probably close in mortgage were underpenetrated in auto and in card and in card in particular we just havent had good offerings weve had ph scaled technology weve had slow we werent we need to improve and its an opportunity for us r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect all right thank you guys very much william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ph sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe rob just it looks like youve locked in a lot of asset repricing as we think about where the nim should normalize relative to the give us a sense i mean you probably have this number do we hit at some point next year in terms of what the normalized rate would be and can we get to a 3plus nim next year even with maybe four or five rate cuts robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 sure so we dont necessarily provide nim guidance because its more an outcome than anything but to answer your question weve operated in call it a normal environment at a nim margin so if we we definitely expect to go up into if we approach those levels it wont be like we havent been there before so its reasonable ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick one on credit quality i think i heard bill say not a whole lot ex cre office but give us a sense if youre seeing any cracks within the ci customer base from the prolonged period of like just higher for longer rates just how do you handicap the risk of a downturn or a recession over the coming months or the next year robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so when we take a look at our total reserves and our total portfolio cre office aside things are pretty stable maybe on quartertoquarter basis consumer is a little bit better commercial noncre is a little bit worse but not bad so definitely some more movements some downgrades reflecting the higher rates slower economic activity in our commercial book but no patterns or any themes to point out ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and outlook for reserves is stable from robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah reserves are stable yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your questions bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey bill the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc following up on your nim and nii commentary is there a point as we start to get cuts where you would start to worry that those rate cuts would potentially begin to negate some of the repricing benefit and then separately amid the debate over whether the curves going to steepen or flatten depending on the outcome of the election maybe could you just give us a little bit of a perspective on how pnc is positioned for either a flatter or a steeper yield curve environment william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure were largely indifferent i mean at the very very margin we benefit on the fed cut rates from a floating rate standpoint of course were exposed to the steepness of the curve because that plays into how we reprice maturing fixed rate assets and thats a variable its a variable for us its a variable for everybody its one of the reasons we locked some of it in my own belief and our positioning is such that even though we would expect the fed to cut here i think in the end somewhat sticky inflation the fact that deficits matter is going to cause the curve to steepen out so we locked some of it in i dont feel terribly worried about the need to lock the rest of it in i dont know but i just think were in a good place were going to do fine bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats helpful and then on the asset quality side slide shows that steady upward trajectory in npls but the reserve rate is relatively stable to down slightly as you mentioned and so it looks like the loss content that you see in the portfolio is stable its certainly not rising despite the rising npls maybe could you speak a little bit to that and are there any implications of loan repricing that you are concerned about for example would you expect any impact on the credit performance of your customers as their loans begin to reset to higher rates william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean just quickly the movement particularly in office cre right from criticized to nonperforming related reserving and chargeoffs is all going as weve expected thats the natural progression of that cycle nothings changed were not surprised by anything were reserved for it credit quality of corporate america as it relates to at what point do the people who have locked in fixed rates at low rates start to have to pay more ultimately the margin is going to impact the way we rate somebody i think about multifamily as an example where higher rates have hurt coverage ratios its not going to cause losses but its caused us to downgrade that asset class simply because the excess isnt there and i think thatll flow through to corporate america over a period of time as well but im not particularly worried about it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and id just add that our reserves are adequate the increase in the noncre npls in commercial really was one single large credit that is in our business credit fully secured loans so william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 yeah not in the us robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc so its doesnt have a lot of loss content william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thanks bill and rob bill if i could squeeze in one last one for you i wanted to get your thoughts on the fednow instant payment services which has been getting some attention is there a fee opportunity there i guess what level of engagement are you seeing from pnc customers do you see potential for lower cost instant digital payments disintermediating debit it would just be helpful to hear your thoughts on the overall risk versus potential benefits of that to pnc william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont think fednow has any impact on pnc to be honest with you weve been active with realtime payments in the clearing house and the use cases all the ones you can think about from insurers who want to pay real time claims in a disaster through to certain payroll capabilities through to zelle for example and fednow doesnt add or subtract anything to that opportunity the challenge you have with realtime payments both at the clearing house and fednow at the fed is they are not networks they are a rail to move money and the distinction between that is a network has very clear rules on whos responsible for items that dont transmit the right way whos responsible for fraud whos responsible for returns on and on and on and neither of those two networks purposefully were built or sorry neither of those two payment rails purposefully were built indiscernible purposefully for moving money indiscernible so i dont think long term it has much of an impact to be honest with you bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks a lot good morning you guys gave us that great william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great table last december with the repricing of fixed assets through and im just wondering how much carryforward will there also be through should we think about that kind of ratably and obviously its been six months since you gave us that slide but just wondering just how that rolls as we look further ahead thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well ken were going to refrain from guidance on the call here today but itll continue to increase but the real change in the dynamic occurs obviously in that first and second quarter of and then grows from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay yeah thats why im asking the building blocks question as opposed to the nii question robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure yeah sure sure sure ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then on the expenses so you guys have been doing a great job holding the line and i just wanted to ask like it looks like theres a pretty decent ramp baked into the second half on expenses and im just wondering like what influences that because it seems like expenses will be growing faster than revenues in the second half so or certainly faster than fees so could you just walk through is that conservatism theres some catchup on investments that youre making any context on that thanks rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure sure no weve outperformed on the first half no doubt about it and we feel great about that and thats one of the reasons why we increased our cip goal and also increased our guidance for the full year expenses in the third quarter it doesnt all happen uniformly in the third quarter we do have some investments coming online technology investments coming online that bring some depreciation expense weve got an additional day those sorts of things so its all part of the plan its just expenses dont fall uniformly throughout the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then obviously as that plays forward and if nii is better next year you can also afford more cost growth but well hear about that later robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please proceed with your questions mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi similar to some of the others maybe this is like the game of jeopardy i think the answer is you have continued improvement program with expense savings going from million up to million you have securities repositioning thats giving you a boost to nii for the rest of this year and you have fixed asset repricing that helps your securities yield go up by basis points your forward payment swaps go up by basis points and a little bit some other things so the answer is all those things are going in the right direction yet you still have a guide for negative operating leverage for this year so i guess what is the question or why is that or you cant eke it out or robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well sure so the now the question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah go ahead robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so just to keep with your jeopardy approach there the question would be whats loan growth going to be in the second half mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful so robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc so it did come down mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 yeah so whats going bill you were very adamant three quarters ago about loan growth and look if you get nii in your range even without getting loan growth i think people would rather take that than not but were hearing all the capital the biggest capital market players are just gushing with their expectations that this is a big capital markets recovery the worlds back everything else h8 data actually showed a little bit better i think you might have underperformed the h8 data this quarter on loan growth so is it a that youre just being more prudent and conservative and youre not seeing the pricing that you want or b your mix is just a little bit differently or c maybe your teams not executing quite as well as youd like them to do william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think youre trying to read into this too hard look were basically on h8 maybe a little soft on consumer because our card book didnt grow when ci comes back traditionally well do better weve been actually adding dhe theyre just not drawing it were winning clients all we did mike was this whole notion of if were giving guidance on the expectation and some crystal ball that says there is going to be loan growth when thus far we dont see evidence of it we just took it out if it shows up then its additive to everything we do and we certainly arent underperforming were winning clients at a pace that we never have so its literally this notion of when do they draw on lines and we just we got tired of talking about it when they do it well benefit and itll add to all of those numbers that youre looking at mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and any meat on those bones about customer acquisition you did mention loan utilization that seems a pretty low level versus a year ago and historical william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so i guess that would back up what youre saying but how much are you growing loans you expanded to so many msas and implemented teams and did all that stuff that helps sometimes in other times it doesnt help as much william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i dont rob do you know dhe numbers the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no i dont know i dont know off the top of my head but william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so weve grown exposures and weve won clients at a pace well beyond particularly in the new markets but overall well beyond what weve managed to do historically we ought to and we will produce some of those metrics for you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no thats all good id just add to that mike capex to sales as we said in our opening comments capex to sales ratios are low inventory levels are low so theres just theres a lot pointing to loan growth its just we dont control it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just the last followup on that because bill youve been around for a while and rob the disconnect between what were hearing and seeing in the capital markets and that activity picking up versus the still subdued loan growth as you say capex inventory are lower just seems ceo confidence is up people are ready to do all sorts of things yet when the rubber meets the road with you guys youre just not seeing it that much william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right youre trying to isolate us and were not isolated i would happily tell you loan growth is going to be which is what all our peers are going to say and if they hit robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc we dont know that right william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc if we hit or sorry if they hit then well hit robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc or maybe a little better william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i just the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont see anything suggesting thats going to happen so maybe i mean what would you rather have us do here put in our forecast a wehopethishappens number or just give you numbers that we know are going to happen mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no i understand underpromise and overdeliver its what we try to do its just in the past you said at this stage of the cycle and historically youve seen loan growth come back so it sounds like william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc this cycle might be it might be a little bit different might not be william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think ive spent a lot of time pondering this mike i dont look at the margin its got to be that the cost of holding inventory right just the cost of that drawn revolver is big time on the radar of corporates who are managing their own profitability if you can run with lower inventory your interest rates go way down when fed funds is so i think thats part of it i think this whole uncertainty as we come up into the election on whats it going to look like from a regulatory basis what am i allowed to invest in am i going to get it approved all of that theres a lot of pentup energy behind that and well see but i dont know and it literally was this thing of rather than keep guessing and wishing if it happens its a great outcome but we dont need to rely on it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it okay thank you william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes operator thank you operator instructions our next questions come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning bill i havent heard you guys talk too much about credit card and you mentioned a new product and some more coming just thoughts on kind of the strategy for card going forward and the targeted customer and then any interest in acquiring portfolios which has not really been on the radar in the past thanks william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no were not going to acquire portfolios the product that we have historically offered our existing clients and the service levels websites processing that went along with it were less than what we aspire to we have an ability to get higher penetration with our existing clients offer them better products have better technology historically we prioritized tech investments inside of our core retail space so think online mobile real time and we just havent put the same energy although about a year ago we started to into what we do in credit card some of that is service technology ease for customers application all of that stuff some of it is just getting better at approvals and were not going to change our credit box but were missing a lot of clients who are in that credit box because we make it too hard for them robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah or in simple terms were just underpenetrated relative to industry averages nothing hugely aspirational other than just to have our fair share william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that makes sense and then just separately i think you still have half of your original visa stake and whats kind of the plan on that and i assume thats in the ph million range marktomarket for visa net of hedges and stuff like that but just frame whats left and the timing of it thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc im sorry i missed the front part of that question william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc visa visa indiscernible matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh just the remaining visa stake and the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc oh what happens with the back half so the that we did not have the ability to monetize well visa controls that schedule some of its reliant on the litigation resolution and some of its reliant on the schedule theyve laid out which is sort of a multiyear exchange so well just continue to monitor it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi bill hi rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc so you guys have a good fortune of having insights into the commercial real estate business through midland your cmbs servicer can you give us some insights and color on what midland is seeing in terms of their pipeline of increased special servicing which of course i know has higher revenue but more importantly maybe directionally shows us where credit is heading robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats a good question gerard ironically their special servicing balances actually went down in the quarter which is a little bit of a headscratcher we dont think thats necessarily indicative of a trend we do expect it to continue to go up but from the start and i think youve asked this question before its been much much slower in terms of those increases of the balances than you would have expected william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and i went through forecast on sort of expectations on maturity bubbles and property types and we dont expect that balance its not going to grow at the pace that intuitively you might have thought of a year ago robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc you would have thought yeah and that we thought a year ago the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah because ph if things arent getting cured theyre getting sold off pretty quickly for things that are really bad theres still a lot of capital in the market so theyre turning it faster than perhaps we would have thought gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc are they seeing any change in the product is it still primarily commercial office or is it moving into any other product areas robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc its mostly office gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its interesting its all of the above for all of the historical reasons robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so theres still a little retail theres hotels thatll show up in there theres multifamily that is in the multifamily that went to freddie fannie and then increasingly its office and the bubble down the road looks more like office robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and then just on your commercial real estate in the slide you give us obviously good detail and youve always told us about this multitenant office is the issue it looks like obviously with criticized how far are the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 you along in analyzing or reviewing that portfolio are you completely through it and now its going a second time or any color there william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean were robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well weve analyzed william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean were completely through it every quarter robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean a couple of things i dont know if we put this out there but theres actually not that many loans so we dont have thousands of small loans these are typically larger loans and so weve gone asset by asset and as anything gets close to being troubled we look at three different appraisals one of which is our own self generated using more extreme negative assumptions than what you might get from a commercial appraiser we use higher vacancy rates higher interest rates longer time to lease up higher cost to rehab all that other stuff in our evaluation so we go through this we know all the properties we keep looking at them we know whats going to happen to them we know the timelines look its not a great outcome but theres nothing in there that i think is going to surprise us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and just one last one on this bill geographically are you guys finding certain parts of the country weaker than others i know theres a lot of talk about the big urban markets class b and c buildings how about from your vantage point what do you guys seeing
