quarter we executed well and delivered solid financial results we generated billion in net income and adjusting for the fdic special assessment per share rob will provide details on our results in a moment but ill start with a few thoughts first we continued to grow our business in the first quarter we added new customers across our segments and increased deposits on a spot basis were continuing to invest heavily in our franchise to drive growth and gain share particularly in our retail banking technology platform or payments businesses and our expansion markets to that end in the first quarter we announced a multiyear investment of nearly billion in our branch network to renovate more than locations and open new branches in key locations including austin dallas denver houston miami and san antonio second expenses were wellmanaged during the quarter as weve indicated expense discipline remains a top priority and we are on track to maintain stable core expenses in third credit quality remained stable during the quarter the office portfolio remains an area of focus but we are adequately reserved overall and particularly with respect to cre we believe our thoughtful approach to managing risk customer selection and longterm relationship development will continue to serve us well and fourth we continued to build on our strong liquidity and capital position during the quarter providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to help us support our clients grow our businesses and capitalize on future opportunities the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 in summary we delivered solid results during the first quarter and positioned ourselves well for the balance of and beyond last month we launched a brand campaign celebrating our boring approach to banking now obviously were using humor in the campaign to have a little fun and grab the publics attention but inside of that humor is honesty about who we are how we think about risk and how we run our company in short it is everything we do to be steady and predictable finally i just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers for each other and for all of our stakeholders so with that ill turn it over to rob to take you through the quarter rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide four and its presented on an average linked quarter basis loans of billion decreased billion or investment securities declined billion or and our cash balances at the federal reserve were billion an increase of billion or on a spot basis our cash at the fed was billion up from billion in the prior quarter reflecting higher periodend deposits deposit balances averaged billion a decline of billion or reflecting seasonally lower commercial deposits however on a spot basis deposits were up billion reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits borrowed funds increased billion to billion primarily driven by parent company debt issuances early in the quarter at quarterend aoci was a negative billion compared to a negative billion at december reflecting the impact of higher interest rates our tangible book value increased to per common share an increase compared to the same period a year ago we remain wellcapitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of march while we recognize the likelihood of potentially substantial changes to the basel iii endgame npr under the currently proposed capital rules our estimated fully phasedin expanded riskbased cet1 ratio would be approximately as of march we continue to be wellpositioned with capital flexibility share repurchases approximated million or roughly million shares and when combined with million of common dividends we returned million of capital to shareholders during the quarter slide shows our loans in more detail compared to the fourth quarter average loan balances decreased primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances commercial loans were billion a decrease of billion driven by lower utilization as well as soft loan demand within the corporate institutional bank utilization rates have remained below yearend levels and have not increased in the first quarter as is historically typical we expect utilization to increase throughout the year notably each percent of utilization within cib equates to billion of loan growth consumer loans declined approximately million driven by lower credit card and home equity balances and total loan yields increased basis points to in the first quarter slide details our investment security and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion decreased as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturity the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities as of march the securities portfolio duration was four years the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 our receivefixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled billion on march the weighted average receivefixed rate of our swap portfolio increased basis points to and the duration of the portfolio was two years through the end of of our securities and swap portfolio is scheduled to mature which will allow us to reinvest into higher yielding assets providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income in the second half of the year accumulated other comprehensive income was negative billion at march which will accrete back as our securities and swaps mature resulting in continued tangible book value growth slide covers our deposits in more detail average deposits decreased billion to billion during the quarter as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by a seasonal decline in commercial deposits regarding mix consolidated noninterestbearing deposits were in the first quarter down slightly from in the fourth quarter notably on a spot basis in the first quarter noninterestbearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline since the fed began raising rates in which gives us confidence that the noninterestbearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the first quarter up from in the prior quarter and as of march our cumulative deposit beta was and consistent with our expectations we believe our deposit betas have approached their peak levels although we do expect some potential drift higher through the period leading up to a fed rate cut which we currently expect to occur in july in regard to the timing and amount of potential rate cuts we recognize theres a lot of fluidity and uncertainty however our nii will largely be unaffected by any shortterm interest rate movement or lack thereof this is because our floating rate assets are aligned with our floating rate liabilities including our high beta commercial interestbearing deposits and our longterm debt which is almost entirely swapped to floating rates importantly going forward we remain wellpositioned for the nii benefit of repricing low yielding fixed rate securities and loans maturing during the latter half of and into turning to the income statement on slide first quarter net income was billion or per share which included a pretax noncore noninterest expense of million or million aftertax related to the increased fdic special assessment excluding noncore expenses adjusted eps was per share total revenue of billion decreased million or compared to the fourth quarter of net interest income declined by million or and our net interest margin was a decline of basis points resulting primarily from higher funding costs noninterest income decreased million or noninterest expense of billion declined million or and included million fdic special assessment importantly core noninterest expense was billion and decreased million or provision was million in the first quarter reflecting portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors and our effective tax rate was turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends first quarter revenue was down million or driven by lower net interest income and in part a seasonal decline in fee income net interest income of billion declined million or reflecting increased funding costs lower loan balances and one less day in the quarter fee income was billion and decreased million or linked quarter looking at the detail asset management and brokerage revenue was up million or reflecting higher average equity markets capital markets and advisory fees declined million or driven by lower ma advisory activity off elevated fourth quarter levels partially offset by higher underwriting fees card and cash management decreased million or driven by seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes partially the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 offset by higher treasury management fees lending and depositrelated fees declined million or reflecting the reduction of customer fees on certain checking products residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined million or and included lower residential mortgage activity other noninterest income of million decreased million or reflecting lower gains on sales the first quarter also included a negative million visa fair value adjustment compared to a negative million adjustment in the fourth quarter turning to slide our core noninterest expense of billion decreased million or linked quarter reflecting strong expense management importantly compared to the first quarter of core noninterest expense declined million or with a decline in every expense category this broadbased result reflects the impact of expense actions taken in as weve previously stated we implemented expense management actions that will drive million of cost savings in these actions include the million workforce reduction effort last year which was realized in our first quarter expense run rate and our million continuous improvement program goal which were well on track to achieve we remain diligent in our expense management efforts and these actions give us confidence that well keep our yearoveryear expenses stable our credit metrics are presented on slide while overall credit quality remains resilient the pressure we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector has continued nonperforming loans increased million or linked quarter almost entirely driven by commercial real estate which increased million and inside of that approximately million was related to the cre office portfolio total delinquencies of billion decreased million or linked quarter driven by lower consumer and commercial delinquencies net loan chargeoffs were million in the first quarter and our annualized net chargeoff to average loans ratio was basis points our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on march stable with december slide provides more detail on our cre office credit metrics while npls have increased over the past few quarters our criticized balances have remained relatively consistent the migration of criticized loans to non performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio in the first quarter net loan chargeoffs within the cre office portfolio were million essentially in line with the previous quarter level ultimately we expect continued chargeoffs on this portfolio and accordingly we believe we are adequately reserved as of march our reserves on the office portfolio were of total office loans and inside of that on the multitenant portfolio importantly we continue to manage our exposure down and as a result our balances declined or approximately million linked quarter in summary pnc reported a solid first quarter and were wellpositioned for the remainder of the year regarding our view of the overall economy were expecting economic expansion in the second half of the year resulting in real gdp growth of approximately in and unemployment to increase modestly to by year end we expect the fed to cut rates two times in with a basis point decrease in july and another in november looking at the second quarter of compared to the first quarter of we expect average loans to be stable net interest income to be down approximately and as i mentioned previously we expect nii and net the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 interest margin to trough in the second quarter fee income to be up to other noninterest income to be in the range of million and million excluding visa activity taking the component pieces of revenue together we expect total revenue to be stable we expect total core noninterest expense to be up to we expect second quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million as a reminder pnc owns million visa class b shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately billion under the terms of visas current exchange program scheduled to close on or about may class b shareholders will have the opportunity to monetize of their holdings weve not included the impact of monetizing the visa gain in our forecast turning to slide our full year guidance is unchanged from our january earnings call and as a reminder for the full year compared to the full year we expect average loan growth of approximately total revenue to be stable to down inside of that our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of to and noninterest income to be up to core noninterest expense which excludes the fdic assessment is expected to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first questions come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay just want to make sure you can hear me okay robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no this is great the first question just has to do with how youre thinking about the nii indicating the trough improving from there and i would think that the majority of that improvement is coming from loan growth but correct me if i am wrong how are you thinking about that nii trajectory into the second half of the year and then well ill start there the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc okay good morning betsy this is rob so in terms of nii and the trajectory that were on we knew at the beginning of the year that we would trough around this time in the second quarter and thats whats happening we expect to grow from that trough level based on the repricing of our fixed rate assets as rates settle down there is some reliance on the back half for loan growth but all consistent with our full year guidance average loans up betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just on that loan growth fees william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc you go ahead bill william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i was just going to say that the largest driver is repricing of fixed rate assets we expect some loan growth but its not a heroic number in there its simply the roll out of our securities book betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it yeah all right and on the loan side it is interesting to see the utilization rates ticking down here do you think thats just a function of fed funds and thats the base rate from which ci is priced off of or is there other dynamics there besides just rate william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a variety of things i think the capital markets activity in the first quarter and investmentgrade debt put a lot of cash into the system and you saw companies that could hit that market pay down the revolver so that was sort of a nearterm impact to it as we look out there hasnt been any real inventory build which i would expect given retail sales there hasnt been much capex and capacity utilization has been holding constant at a pretty high level so at some point this needs to turn but i think the first quarter kind of surprised us and my best guess was that was on the back of just how liquid the public markets were betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it thanks so much really appreciate it bill the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your questions john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the expense front looks like within expenses they came in a bit better than expected maybe on the comp side and certain other areas and you cited the solid expense management and your cost save efforts would you say that the trends are coming in perhaps a bit better than you had forecasted as you look at your expense phase and is there any thought process that potentially your full year outlook could prove conservative in terms of your stable expectations robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc john this is rob so id say for the full year were still planning and guiding towards stable in the first quarter youre right were off to a good start in terms of realizing the expense actions that we took last year and the cip program that we have this year but its a little early in the year to roll that all forward and like i said were off to a good start and were wellpositioned for stable john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks rob thats helpful and then just separately on the credit side you could see the commercial real estate stress that you mentioned and you prudently added to the office reserve in the quarter but relatively stable or down a little bit in terms of your firmwide reserve could you maybe talk about the progression in credit and other areas are you seeing any mounting stress at all in ci that could potentially keep the reserve currently stable or could you continue to from a firmwide perspective bleed the reserve here william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc bleed is a bad word the credit action at the moment is in the real estate book and specifically inside of office consumer at the margin a little bit worse but there isnt anything systematic going on in ci that would cause us to have any different expectations of what we see now and were reserved for the moment based on our economic forecast robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pressure is in the cre book specifically the office book the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then just related to that are you seeing migration in the office book that is surprising given your forecast that you added notably to the office reserve is there anything there that surprise you in terms of your reappraisals or your work on that front robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no no surprises everything is progressing as we expected we started with the criticized the npls are up a little bit but everything is consistent with what weve been seeing john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks rob operator thank you our next questions come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning looking at slide here where you show the runoff of the fixed rate securities and swaps and any way to size the revenue pickup from this either anchoring to the forward curve or current rates we put out some crude analysis that showed about a billion impact and just said it was linear so half this year half next but obviously its rough cut at it so i dont know if you have any comments on that or frame it on using your estimates thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no i would say so we laid it out in the slides in terms of what we see in terms of runoff and obviously the projected aoci burn down as it relates to capital but all of thats in our guide so in terms of what our expectations are in terms of that behavior thats in our full year nii guide which is down to but just to make the point in terms of what we were saying earlier go forward the biggest variable is the repricing of our fixed rate assets and in this case securities william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc matt i think what everybodys struggling with here is this notion of whats the fed going to do in the next period of time is it new cuts or no cuts or three cuts remember we started out with six cuts robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc we didnt william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 yeah we did not but the market did we know based on forward curve the repricing of our fixed rate assets the amount of money incremental money we will earn from that has increased because term rates have increased at the same time the assumption that the fed will maintain rates here longer causes us to pause on what happens to deposit pricing through time right so theres a tradeoff higher rates in the long run obviously help us on our fixed rate assets deposit repricing continues on if the fed holds longer a much slower pace than its been in the past but i think it would be a bit of a heroic assumption for anybody to say that deposit costs wont continue to creep up in the face of a steady fed and so thats the tradeoff in the near term longer term the repricing of the fixed rate assets dwarfs the repricing of deposits and thats kind of why we say look in the second quarter we trough and then we pick up from there robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and then to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc that makes sense and then sorry if i missed it earlier but did you reiterate your view that net interest income would be record level and if you did what would derail that the higher for longest doesnt sound like that will change it is there still a loan growth component or if rates go down too much just what would be the risk of achieving that if you still have that view thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean the biggest risk would a massive curve inversion such that we were repricing fixed rate securities at lower yields at robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc than they are today william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well i mean than what they were three months ago our original assumptions in that forecast yields were ph bps lower than they are right now if they were to fall well below that we would be at risk at that record number although still a high number robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and matt this is rob its rob ill take the opportunity to reiterate our view that will be a record nii matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 perfect thank you very much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi bill hi rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc rob you talked about the utilization of the ci loans that it was lower in the first quarter and normally it kind of ticks up a bit question on that do you think your customers are just uncertain about their outlooks which is kind of held them back from drawing down on lines of credit or do you think that theyre having access to other lenders meaning private credit market or the public markets that has taken away opportunities for banks to have these companies increase those lines of utilization william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc i think its both william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the capital markets activity in the first quarter the private credit side on leveraged finance doesnt really impact us but the public markets were wide open by the way our fees were up in that space for serving clients that way but naturally at the margin that causes our utilization to go down the other issue you cant ignore right but weve seen capital spend and inventory build be next to nothing even though capacity utilization is high retail sales are high and at some point thats got to give but i do think there continues to be hesitancy on manufacturers in particular just in the face of this economy and i think thats part of it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and looking for a stability factor which will help the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i know rob i think you touched on in an answer to a question about the commercial real estate outlook office in particular and you guys everything appears to be going in your expectations what kind of pricing declines in appraisals that have come up and where youve had to reappraise certain properties are you seeing price declines on those appraisals or more any color there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean much higher than that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc variance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the variance is all over the place but as a practical matter if we were underwritten at the start at to on whatever the appraised value was at that point in time a big chunk of the book right now is effectively at par when we look at resolutions that weve gone through weve had everything from we get out hold till we lose on the dollar on a given loan robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats the variance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so its buildingspecific its marketspecific thats driving this but loss rates are a lot higher if you looked at office and said hey how much value has fallen its a lot higher than personally across the spaces in my view is closer to or or even higher robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and youre thinking ahead in terms of where were going william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well its not showing up in appraisals here were just seeing it in actual resolution of properties the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your questions david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys just back on the nii guide you mentioned the largest driver of the growth youre looking for in the back half of the year is coming from the repricing then you got the loan growth as another factor was just wondering what youre assuming for deposit flows within that as well i would assume that those could be a little bit better just from a seasonal perspective in the back half of the year and then on the securities rolling off how much of that liquidity is getting plowed back into the securities book and what kind of yields youre looking at there at this point on purchases william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so ill let rob hit deposits in a second the assumption i mean we have rolloff of both fixed rate loans and fixed rate securities and the yields we assume in our forecast at this point are just forward curve adjusted for whatever the right spread is of the asset were replacing so likeforlike robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and then just on the deposits back at the beginning of the year we expected deposits to decline year overyear lowsingledigits we still expect that albeit in the first quarter we did outperform that a bit but our expectations are for slightly lower deposits through the balance of the year david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then on the loan growth outlook which you talked about i guess on an endofperiod basis last quarter does higher for longer impact that expectation at all and whats your outlook for the longer end of the curve through the year william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no i dont know that i thought much about how higher for longer impacts loan growth or not the outlook that we have for rates at this point our official outlook is we have what do we say two cuts starting in july at this point with the curve largely staying where it is our forecast whether were using current forward curve or even when rates were lower our nii forecast isnt terribly sensitive to what were assuming at least for this year because the incremental amount we make from higher yields on bonds and loans repricing were assuming is largely offset on the deposit costs the leakage that occurs if the fed doesnt cut rates so were not making heroic assumptions on rates we dont really care where they go in the near term what we know is once we get through the second quarter here that the repricing of fixed rate assets simply starts to dwarf the potential repricing on deposits independent on where rates are the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it great thanks guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess maybe the tenth question on your loan growth outlook for the back half i think i guess the macro concern is that higher for longer will eventually tip this economy into a recession would love to hear bill rob your perspective based on what you are hearing from your bankers clients if we dont get any rate cuts for the year based on what youre seeing like could we have a blind spot where the economy really kind of tails off where a lot of these things catch up we enter some version of a ph stagflation just how do you handicap that downside risk heading into the back half of the year william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look i think thats a possibility one of the peculiar things about utilization is when credit conditions tighten utilization increases its actually one of the primary drivers of utilization so bizarrely loan growth would increase if you ran because utilization would increase if you ran into that scenario but i do worry about that look eventually if the only way to get rid of inflation is to really hurt the economy i worry less about loan growth and more about longterm credit losses for the whole industry just as right now everybody is planning for a soft landing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and you still think soft landing is base case in terms of most likely outcome right now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and separately one i think thanks for your advocacy on bank ma just wanted to follow up on the letter you wrote to the occ one are you finding any kind of sympathy within the regulatory apparatus around the case for allowing for larger bank ma and is there any possibility that we see dealmaking pick up ahead of the elections william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sorry and any possibility of what the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc of dealmaking picking up ahead of the november elections william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look the letter was selfexplanatory and weve kind of beaten the topic to death i guess what i would suggest is i think the banking industry by and large is set up to do well over the next months or so simply through rates normalizing assuming you didnt have big concentrations to real estate in office and i think everybody in the near term is focused on that i think long term some of the charts weve put in that letter its just hard to ignore you see the two largest banks in the country who in the last four years grew of size larger than truist us bank and pnc put together i dont know what the regulators think or dont think about that the intent of the letter was to just point out that if what they wrote in the occ comment letter was to freeze ma across the country for any bank over billion i think you can see the outcome that well have in this country which is a massive consolidation with the giant national banks its all my point was ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and do you see the backdrop conducive for dealmaking over the coming months quarters or william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at what robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc anything near term william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc for us robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah or the industry william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no i think most banks tend to hang out the next months because their earnings are going to improve and their internal forecasts are going to look good and everythings rosy i worry about the outyears but in the near term i imagine everybodys internal look looks pretty good robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and we dont control others timing indiscernible the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc excellent got it thank you so much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your questions bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob following up on your comments around soft loan demand and utilization rates assuming we avoid recession and the soft landing scenario plays out how would you respond to the view that the ingredients may not be in place for a reacceleration in loan growth given this environment where fed funds is running above cpi and the fed cant cut amid sticky inflation we spent most of the postgfc era with fed funds running below cpi and had midsingledigit loan growth but would just love your thoughts on the risk that loan growth may not go up much if the fed cant cut below cpi and do you lean more heavily into your fee based businesses if that happens william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im not sure fed funds versus cpi necessarily has much to do with loan growth i think loan growth ultimately is driven by the economy and the economy has been running hotter than most people had assumed and its been running hotter than most people had assumed without big inventory builds if you look at fourth quarter gdp there was a drawdown on inventories inventories are directly correlated with the utilization of loan growth and capex has been muted so if the economy slows if the fed has to slow the economy to a point where its not a soft landing in order to get inflation under control that can hurt loan growth but if the economy is strong you just saw retail sales eventually its going to translate into loan growth independent of whether or not theres positive real rates robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think thats a strong correlation there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and then as a followup on your comments about the visa b shares how should we think about the dollar amount and the use of proceeds robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 well so yeah as i mentioned our comments on may well have the opportunity to monetize of our holdings which our holdings are roughly billion in unrealized gains and that will just be capital and well look at how we apply everything in terms of our excess capital but well wait until we get the capital to do that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you for taking my questions robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well monetize half of the billion operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning just a followup on the fee side i think when you spoke in january you talked about expected slowness in capital markets and ma to begin the year and then i think you were thinking about a growth overall just wondering just how thats looking in terms of the body language youre getting from those middle market clients in harris williams and then also if you have any other color on what you think the other drivers of fees are going to be thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean the harris williams pipeline at the moment is larger larger than its ever been but its larger than it was last year robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc just their first quarter relative to their fourth quarter is light and thats what drove the quarteronquarter change in our total fees robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so ken to answer your question we are sticking to the expectation for growth in capital markets yearoveryear bills right first quarter was off elevated fourth quarter levels but in terms of the comp last year in the second and third quarter capital markets was really soft harris williams is really soft and the pipeline suggests we are not going to repeat that will be well above those levels the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it all right and last one just on the asset and wealth side i think youve had some pretty good flows and things like that first quarter starting point was more of the markets i know you put a lot of effort into that business any sense of just change in terms of like asset flows and new business wins and incremental potential revenue growth out of that business specifically william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we have had success over the last year kind of repositioning who and what we are in the market bringing in new assets to accelerate that to a level where it becomes a meaningful part of our company i think is a bit of a challenge its a service to our clients and were good at it but the trends are going the right way robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i would just add to that ken obviously the business is doing well with the equity markets supporting that the growth opportunity is in the new bbva markets in the southwest where youll recall bbva really didnt have a wealth management business so were de novo so to speak in all those markets but were up and running with teams asset inflows are occurring and long term thats where the incremental growth will come from ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and one more just to follow up is that an area that you could add to inorganically over time i know its tough just because of multiples and whatnot but youve done it organically as you just said william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats a tough business in my view to add to inorganically cultural difference is the way you go to market the outright price and the goodwill associated with the return on equity that comes with that makes it all really difficult to do and at least historically the opportunity to grow organically is much stronger than going out and trying to add to it through purchase ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next questions come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please proceed with your questions mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi it looks like you were leaning into the expense control this quarter but im just trying to figure out ahead so you mentioned million of cost savings for this year how much of that was in the first quarter but you also mentioned billion of extra spending for branches how much of that was in the first quarter and how should we the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 think about those offsets and i know its a tough fight to get positive operating leverage this year do you feel better or worse or the same as you did three months ago thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well let me chunk that down so well start with the positive operating leverage for the full year we still think thats pretty tough not including any visa gains of course simply because of the nii and the rate issues and those run rates we do feel good about our expenses weve projected and guided to being stable yearoveryear were off to a good start in the first quarter a little bit ahead of where we expected to be but we still got a long way to go so all of the items that you talked about theyre in there but the guidance is stable over yearover year which is important to us mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay ill shift gears back bill you were talking about commercial real estate look you reserved for office and you said the value of the underlying properties are probably down to or more so i guess that is reflected in your reserving which i think is more than the average bank do you see a difference by and i know it changes by region and subregion and property and type and all that but do you see a difference by region whether its the big cities give a little sense of that variance you said its all over the place can you just fill out a few data points around that that would be great william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no surprise parts of california are the worst but it really comes down to the building and the market i mean you could have a building thats in the right place in pittsburgh and its doing absolutely fine and you could have a building thats in the wrong place in pittsburgh and its literally worth zero and thats the market were playing with right now now inside of that whole thing we do feel that weve been ahead of this game that were reserved correctly that we are conservatively taking marks and we have the opportunity to do so but this is going to play out over time and your eyes arent lying to you when you look out and see vacancies and i think ourselves and the large banks have been pretty open about its going to be an issue its not a massive book of business for us im not particularly worried about it were wellreserved but its going to roll through the country and impact some of the smaller banks i think in a way that is probably larger than people robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just one short followup on that one the longer rates stay higher do you expect this to bleed over from office to other areas of commercial real estate the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc with the margin yes but it is kind of just at the margin so you see debt service coverage ratios decline as interest costs take more of the cash flow out and in multifamily for example rents arent increasing at the pace they once were the massive difference though mike is that all other types or virtually all other types of real estate are cash flowing so theres a value to them right they just might not cash flow to support the original amount of debt they had the problem you have in office is in many instances theres no cash flow at all its really a unique animal at the moment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please proceed with your questions john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp hey guys just wanted to just touch base on how youre thinking about capital build obviously youre building organically youve got some visa that will add bps bps next quarter i guess are you just kind of thinking of gradually kind of building from this reported and the fully loaded to get to or or so over the next year do a little bit of buybacks just kind of whats the plan there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well you phrased the question almost exactly correctly so congratulations john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp almost william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc when you think about it inside we have always moving pieces so inside of the npr basel iii endgame the one thing its all up in the air but the one thing that you got to believe is going to stick is aoci and so if thats the case then our printed a3 number is kind of our real number and that would be otherwise too low for us if we want to build that through time some of that will happen just from the rundown of the book and some of that will happen through us building capital the ultimate where should we be basel iii endgame everything settled out number i dont know that weve necessarily set yet other than its higher than where we sit today on the a3 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats fair thats fair and weve got capital flexibility as you know john and thats where you want to be right now with the fluidity of everything the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research
