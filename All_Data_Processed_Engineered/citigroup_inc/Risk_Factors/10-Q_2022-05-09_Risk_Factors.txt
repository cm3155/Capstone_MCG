accessed through citis broker dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which are typically collateralized by government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory secured funding of billion as of march decreased from the prioryear period and increased sequentially driven by normal business activity the average balance for secured funding was approximately billion for the quarter ended march the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity the majority of this activity is secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions

the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new

related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments the estimated impact to citis net interest income ire was largely unchanged from the fourth quarter of with increased expected gains in nonusd currencies offset by decreased expected gains due to usd rate moves the decline in the estimated impact to aoci primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of citis investment securities and related interest rate derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates as of march citi expects that the billion initial negative impact to aoci would be offset in stockholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio over approximately

assumptions around the projected balance sheet holding it static coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions to ire these changes will be implemented and disclosed before the end of and will result in a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring

the impact this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may to citis net interest income and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of march citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro and indian rupee in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted change in fx spot rate1 change in tce due to fx translation net of hedges as a percentage of tce take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared

adjustment also known as diversification benefit equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the vars relating to each risk type the determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes the total trading var includes marktomarket and certain

iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions as of march there was one backtesting exception observed for citis regulatory var for the prior months
