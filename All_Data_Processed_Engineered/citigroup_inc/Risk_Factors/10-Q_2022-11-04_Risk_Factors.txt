securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making

commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modelling and other factors during the third quarter of citi transitioned its ire analysis employing enhanced methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes included among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions notably accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes resulted in a higher impact to citis net interest income over a 12month period see the table below for details under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio var it excludes impacts from any positions which are included in total trading and credit portfolio var citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis common equity tier and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates while limiting the potential impact on its aoci and regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity market risk market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see market risk overview and risk factors in citis form 10k market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis nontrading market risk policy managements asset liability committee alco establishes citis risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book which are subject to approval by citigroups board of directors corporate treasury is responsible for the daytoday management of citis banking book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the alco citis banking book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from treasury risk management a second line of defense team reporting to the treasury chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rate eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in maturity of instruments resulting from changes in interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their clientfacing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk

million and million for september june and september respectively includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments citis balance sheet is asset sensitive assets reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios the estimated impact to citis net interest income in a bps upward rate shock scenario as of the third quarter of increased modestly quarterover quarter and decreased yearoveryear primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to us dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in citis balance sheet at progressively higher interest rate levels the marginal net interest income benefit is lower as citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currencyspecific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the million initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately three months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different scenarios of changes in interest rate for the us dollar and all other currencies in which citi has invested capital as of september the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the

each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated the estimated impact to citis net interest income under the previous ire measure is million million million million and million for scenarios through respectively includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income remains larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities for other currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension

due to fx translation net of hedges as a percentage of tce changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of september citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates and the quarterly impact of these changes

model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market

citi has separately described these risks in deconsolidation risk below during the third quarter of citi continued to reduce its operations in russia and russiarelated exposures resulting in a net decrease in total russia exposure of billion shown in the table above as well as a change in composition of exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced citis third party credit risk depreciation of

exposure also reflected a shift to a higher proportion of stronger credit names including a higher proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are headquartered outside of russia primarily in the us and europe the decline in overall exposure was also driven by a reduction in exposures to russian counterparties not held by ao citibank citis net investment in russia was
