risk factors the following discussion presents what management currently believes could be the material risks and uncertainties that could impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition other risks and uncertainties including those not currently known to citi or its management could also negatively impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition thus the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties that citi may face for additional information about risks and uncertainties that could impact citi see executive summary and each respective business results of operations above and managing global risk below the following risk factors are categorized to improve the readability and usefulness of the risk factor disclosure and while the headings and risk factors generally align with citis risk categorization in certain instances the risk factors may not directly correspond with how citi categorizes or manages its risks marketrelated risks macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties could continue to have a negative impact on citi citi has experienced and could experience in the future negative impacts to its businesses results of operations and financial condition as a result of various macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges uncertainties and volatility these include among other things significantly elevated levels of inflation higher interest rates global supply shocks and lower economic growth rates as well as an increasing risk of recession in europe the us and other countries for example in the us the uk the eu and other economies experienced significantly higher levels of widespread inflation as a result the federal reserve board frb and other central banks have substantially raised interest rates reduced the size of their balance sheets and taken other actions in an aggressive effort to curb inflation these actions are expected to slow economic growth increase the risk of recession and increase the unemployment rate in the us and other countries all of which would likely adversely affect citis consumer and institutional clients businesses and results of operations elevated levels of inflation are also expected to continue to result in higher labor and other costs thus putting further pressure on citis expenses interest rates on loans citi makes are typically based off or set at a spread over a benchmark interest rate and would likely decline or rise as benchmark rates decline or rise respectively while citi expects its overall net interest income would generally increase due to higher interest rates higher rates could adversely affect its funding costs levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or product revenues citis net interest income could be adversely affected due to a flattening a lower spread between shorterterm versus longerterm interest rates or longer lasting or more severe inversion shorterterm interest rates exceeding longerterm interest rates of the interest rate yield curve as citi similar to other banks typically pays interest on deposits based on shorterterm interest rates and earns money on loans based on longerterm interest rates for additional information on citis interest rate risk see managing global riskmarket riskbanking book interest rate risk below additionally citis balance sheet includes interestrate sensitive fixedrate assets such as us treasuries us agency securities and residential mortgages among others whose valuation would be adversely impacted in a risingrate environment andor whose hedging costs may increase russias war in ukraine has caused supply shocks in energy food and other commodities markets worsened inflation increased cybersecurity risks increased the risk of recession in europe and heightened geopolitical tensions actions by russia and any further measures taken by the us or its allies could continue to have negative impacts on regional and global energy and other commodities and financial markets and macroeconomic conditions adversely impacting jurisdictions where citi operates and citis customers clients and employees citis ability to continue to reduce its operations and exposure in russia including completion of the winddown of its consumer and local commercial banking operations and nearly all of its institutional banking services in the country may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties local market conditions and sanctions and other governmental regulations or actions moreover citis remaining operations in russia subject citi to various other risks among which are foreign currency volatility including appreciations or devaluations restrictions arising from retaliatory russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business including without limitation its provision to its customers of certain securities services sanctions or asset freezes and other deconsolidation events examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of citis subsidiary bank in russia ao citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities including expropriation ie the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government court administrator trustee or regulator revocation of banking license and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management in the event of a loss of control of ao citibank citi would be required to write off its net investment in the entity recognize a cta loss through earnings and recognize a loss on intercompany liabilities owed by ao citibank to other citi entities outside of russia in the sole event of a substantial liquidation as opposed to a loss of control citi would be required to recognize the cta loss through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve additionally citi may incur reputational harm if its actions are perceived to be misaligned with citis announced reductions of its operations and exposure in russia for additional information about these risks see the operational processes and systems cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors and managing global riskother risks country riskrussia below covid19 is expected to continue to adversely affect global health and could negatively impact macroeconomic conditions in the extent of the impact remains uncertain and will largely depend on future developments in china the us and other countries such as the severity and duration of the public health consequences including the course of variants the public response and government actions covid19 could again disrupt supply chains worsen inflation and reduce economic activity these factors could adversely impact citis businesses and results of operations and financial condition additional areas of uncertainty include among others economic and geopolitical challenges related to china including related policy actions distress in chinese real estate finance and other credit markets tensions or conflicts between china and taiwan andor between china and the us significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets including foreign currency volatility and devaluations and continued strength in the us dollar other geopolitical tensions and conflicts protracted or widespread trade tensions financial market other economic and political disruption driven by populist movements and governments natural disasters other pandemics and election outcomes including the effects of divided government in the us such as with respect to raising of the federal debt limit for example citis marketmaking businesses can suffer losses resulting from the widening of credit spreads due to unanticipated changes in financial markets moreover adverse developments or downturns in one or more of the worlds larger economies would likely have a significant impact on the global economy or the economies of other countries because of global financial and economic linkages strategic risks citis ability to return capital to common shareholders substantially depends on regulatory capital requirements including the results of the ccar process and doddfrank act regulatory stress tests citis ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets whether through its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program substantially depends among other things on regulatory capital requirements including the annual recalibration of the stress capital buffer scb which is based upon the results of the ccar process required by the frb and recalibration of the gsib surcharge citis ability to return capital also depends on its results of operations and financial condition including the capital impact related to its remaining divestitures such as among other things any temporary capital impact from cta losses net of hedges between transaction signings and closings and achievement

in regulatory capital rules requirements or interpretations could continue to have a material impact on citis regulatory capital for example on october citis required regulatory cet1 capital ratio increased to from due to an increase in the scb requirement see below for information on calculation of the scb in addition on january citis required regulatory cet1 capital ratio further increased to from under the standardized approach as the current gsib surcharge increased to from due to these increases as well as macroeconomic uncertainty citi paused common share repurchases beginning as of the third quarter of in addition the us banking agencies are considering a number of changes to the us regulatory capital framework in the future including but not limited to revisions to the us basel iii rules and potential changes to the gsib surcharge slr and discretionary countercyclical capital buffer all of these potential changes could negatively impact citis regulatory capital position or increase citis regulatory capital requirements all firms subject to ccar requirements including citi will continue to be subject to a rigorous regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices including but not limited to governance risk management data quality and internal controls citis ability to return capital may be adversely impacted if such an evaluation of citi results in negative findings the frb has stated that it expects capital adequacy practices to continue to evolve and to likely be determined by its yearly crossfirm review of capital plan submissions similarly the frb has indicated that as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements several parameters of the annual stress testing process may continue to be altered including the severity of the stress test scenario the frb modeling of citis balance sheet pre provision net revenue and stress losses and the addition of components deemed important by the frb for information on limitations on citis ability to return capital to common shareholders as well as the ccar process supervisory stress test requirements and gsib surcharge see capital resources overview and capital resourcesstress testing component of capital planning above and the risk management risk factor below beginning january citi was required to phase into regulatory capital at per year the changes in retained earnings dtas and acl determined upon the january cecl adoption date as well as subsequent changes in the acl through december the frb has stated that it plans to maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the supervisory stress test cycle while continuing to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework the impacts on citis capital adequacy of the frbs incorporation of cecl into its supervisory stress tests on an ongoing basis and of other potential regulatory changes in the frbs stress testing methodologies remain unclear for additional information regarding the cecl methodology including the transition provisions related to the adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of

severely adverse scenario over a nine quarter ccar measurement period plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends subject to a minimum requirement of the scb is calculated by the frb using its proprietary data and modeling of each firms results accordingly citis scb may change annually based on the supervisory stress test results thus potentially resulting in additional volatility in the calculation of citis required regulatory cet1 capital ratio under the standardized approach similar to the other regulatory capital buffers a breach of the scb may result in graduated limitations on capital distributions for additional information on the scb see capital resourcesregulatory capital buffers above although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of and the ultimate impact to citi from these changes to the frbs regulatory capital stress testing and ccar regimes these changes could increase the level of capital citi is required or elects to hold including as part of citis management buffer thus potentially impacting the extent to which citi is able to return capital to shareholders citi must continually review analyze and successfully adapt to ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes in the us and globally citi its management and its businesses continue to face ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes both in the us and globally while the areas of ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes facing citi are too numerous to list completely examples include but are not limited to i potential fiscal monetary tax sanctions and other changes promulgated by the us federal government and other governments including as a result of priority shifts depending on individuals political parties and other groups in governmental positions ii potential changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to citi including the basel iii rules see the capital return risk factor and capital resourcesregulatory capital standards developments above and iii rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the us and globally related to climate change and other esg areas that vary and may conflict across jurisdictions including any new disclosure requirements see the climate change risk factor below references to regulatory refer to both formal regulation and the views and expectations of citis regulators in their supervisory roles for example in february the consumer financial protection bureau proposed significant changes to the maximum amounts on credit card late fees which if adopted as proposed would reduce credit card fee revenues in branded cards and retail services in pbwm in addition us and international regulatory and legislative initiatives have not always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis and areas of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to their scope interpretation timing structure or approach leading to inconsistent or even conflicting requirements including within a single jurisdiction for example in the european commission adopted as part of capital requirements directive v crd v a new requirement for major banking groups headquartered outside the eu which would include citi to establish an intermediate eu holding company where the foreign bank has two or more institutions broadly meaning banks brokerdealers and similar financial firms established in the eu while in some respects the requirement mirrors an existing us requirement for nonus banking organizations to form us intermediate holding companies the implementation of the eu holding company requirement could lead to additional complexity with respect to citis resolution planning capital and liquidity allocation and efficiency in various jurisdictions further ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes make citis and its managements longterm business balance sheet and strategic budget planning difficult subject to change and potentially more costly and may impact its results of operations us and other regulators globally have implemented and continue to discuss various changes to certain regulatory requirements which would require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to citi its businesses and business planning for example while the basel iii regulatory reforms and revised market risk framework have been finalized at the international level there remain significant uncertainties with respect to the integration of these revisions into the us regulatory capital framework business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes which can change dramatically upon finalization or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide and such guidance can change regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly increased citis compliance risks and costs see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below and can adversely affect citis businesses results of operations and financial condition citis continued investment and other initiatives as part of its transformation and strategic refresh may not be as successful as it projects or expects as part of its transformation and other strategic initiatives citi continues to make significant investments to improve its risk and control environment modernize its data and technology infrastructure and further enhance safety and soundness for additional information on these investments see executive summary above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citi also continues to make businessled investments as part of the execution of its strategic refresh for example citi has been making investments across the company including for example hiring front office colleagues and enhancing product capabilities and platforms to improve client digital experiences and add scalability and implementing new capabilities and partnerships citi has also been pursuing productivity improvements through various technology and digital initiatives organizational simplification and location strategies citis multiyear transformation initiatives involve significant execution complexity and there is inherent risk that these will not be as productive or effective as citi expects or at all conversely failure to properly invest in and upgrade citis technology and processes could result in citis inability to meet regulatory expectations be sufficiently competitive serve clients effectively and avoid operational errors for additional information see the operational processes and systems and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factors below moreover citis ability to achieve expected returns on its investments and productivity improvements depends in part on factors that it cannot control including among others macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties customer client and competitor actions and ongoing regulatory requirements or changes citis strategic refresh also includes the divestiture of its remaining consumer banking businesses in legacy franchises including mexico consumersbmm in order to simplify the company and enhance its allocation of resources these divestitures involve significant uncertainty and execution complexity and may result in additional cta or other losses charges or other negative financial or strategic impacts which could be material for information about risks related to citis operations in russia see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor above and managing global riskother riskscountry riskrussia below for additional information about cta losses see executive summary and the capital return risk factor above and the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor below citis investment and other initiatives may continue to evolve as its business strategies the market environment and regulatory expectations change which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement and limit their effectiveness climate change presents various financial and non financial risks to citi and its customers and clients climate change presents both immediate and longterm risks to citi and its customers and clients with the risks expected to increase over time climate risks can arise from both physical risks those risks related to the physical effects of climate change and transition risks risks related to regulatory market technological stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a lowcarbon economy physical and transition risks can manifest themselves differently across citis risk categories in the short medium and long terms physical risks from climate change include acute risks such as hurricanes and floods as well as consequences of chronic changes in climate such as rising sea levels prolonged droughts and systemic changes to geographies and any resulting population migration such physical risks could have adverse financial operational and other impacts on citi both directly on its business and operations and indirectly as a result of impacts to citis clients customers vendors and other counterparties these impacts can include destruction damage or impairment of properties and other assets disruptions to business operations and supply chains and reduced availability or increase in the cost of insurance physical risks can also impact citis credit risk exposures for example in its mortgage and commercial real estate lending businesses transition risks may arise from changes in regulations or market preferences toward lowcarbon industries or sectors which in turn could have negative impacts on asset values results of operations or the reputations of citi and its customers and clients for example citis corporate credit exposures include oil and gas power and other industries that may experience reduced demand for carbonintensive products due to the transition to a lowcarbon economy failure to adequately consider transition risk in developing and executing on its business strategy could lead to a loss of market share lower revenues and higher credit costs additionally if citis response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient or citi is unable to achieve its objectives or commitments relating to climate change its businesses reputation attractiveness to certain investors and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer for example the need to decarbonize in a gradual and orderly way while promoting energy security may lead to continued exposure to carbonintensive activity that in turn may raise such reputational risks even as some regulators seek to mandate additional disclosure of climaterelated information citis ability to comply with such requirements and conduct more robust climaterelated risk analyses may be hampered by lack of information and reliable data data on climaterelated risks is limited in availability often based on estimated or unverified figures collected and reported on a lag and variable in quality modeling capabilities to analyze climaterelated risks and interconnections are improving but remain incomplete moreover us and nonus banking regulators and others are increasingly focusing on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions both directly and with respect to their clients for example in december the frb requested comment on draft principles that would provide a highlevel framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climaterelated financial risks for frbsupervised financial institutions with more than billion in assets legislative and regulatory changes and uncertainties regarding climaterelated risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs for citi for additional information see the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes risk factor above in addition citi could face increased regulatory reputational and legal scrutiny as a result of its climate risk sustainability and other esg related commitments and disclosures citi also faces potentially conflicting antiesg initiatives from certain us state governments that may impact its ability to conduct certain business within those jurisdictions as well as from congress for information on citis climate and other sustainability initiatives see sustainability and other esg matters below for additional information on citis management of climate risk see managing global riskstrategic risksclimate risk below citis ability to utilize its dtas and thus reduce the negative impact of the dtas on citis regulatory capital will be driven by its ability to generate us taxable income at december citis net dtas were billion net of a valuation allowance of billion of which billion was deducted from citis cet1 capital under the us basel iii rules primarily relating to net operating losses foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards of the net dtas at december billion related to foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards net of a valuation allowance the carryforward utilization period for ftcs is years and represents the most timesensitive component of citis dtas the ftc carryforwards at december expire over the period of citi must utilize any ftcs generated in the thencurrentyear tax return prior to utilizing any carryforward ftcs the accounting treatment for realization of dtas including ftcs is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies forecasts of future taxable earnings will depend upon various factors including among others macroeconomic conditions in addition any future increase in us corporate tax rates could result in an increase in citis dta which may subject more of citis existing dta to exclusion from regulatory capital while improving citis ability to utilize its ftc carryforwards citis overall ability to realize its dtas will primarily be dependent upon its ability to generate us taxable income in the relevant tax carryforward periods although utilization of ftcs in any year is generally limited to of foreign source taxable income in that year overall domestic losses odl that citi has incurred in the past allow it to reclassify domestic source income as foreign source failure to realize any portion of the net dtas would have a corresponding negative impact on citis net income and financial returns citi has not been and does not expect to be subject to the base erosion anti abuse tax beat which if applicable to citi in any given year would have a significantly adverse effect on both citis net income and regulatory capital for additional information on citis dtas including ftcs see significant accounting policies and significant estimatesincome taxes below and notes and citis interpretation or application of the complex tax laws to which it is subject could differ from those of governmental authorities which could result in litigation or examinations and the payment of additional taxes penalties or interest citi is subject to various incomebased tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities as well as the numerous non us jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are inherently complex and citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to its entities operations and businesses for example the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd pillar initiative contemplates a global minimum tax with respect to earnings in each separate country eu member states are required to adopt the oecd pillar rules in and other nonus countries are expected to follow suit under these rules citi will be required to pay a topup tax to the extent that citis effective tax rate in any given country is below the us is not expected to pass pillar legislation in the near term but the topup tax can be collected by other countries while many aspects of the application of the rules remain uncertain citi does not expect a material effect to its earnings in addition citi is subject to litigation or examinations with us and nonus tax authorities regarding nonincome based tax matters while citi has appropriately reserved for such matters where there is a probable loss and has disclosed as reasonably possible matters that are morelikelythannot the outcome from the matters may be different than citis expectations citis interpretations or application of the tax laws including with respect to withholding stamp service and other nonincome taxes could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority which could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes penalties or interest which could be material see note for additional information on litigation and examinations involving nonus tax authorities a deterioration in or failure to maintain citis co branding or private label credit card relationships could have a negative impact on citi citi has cobranding and private label relationships through its branded cards and retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and merchants whereby in the ordinary course of business citi issues credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants the five largest relationships across both businesses in us personal banking constituted an aggregate of approximately of citis revenues in for additional information see personal banking and wealth management above citis cobranding and private label agreements often provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term competition among card issuers including citi for these relationships is significant and citi may not be able to maintain such relationships on existing terms or at all citis cobranding and private label relationships could also be negatively impacted by among other things the general economic environment including the impacts of significantly elevated levels of inflation higher interest rates global supply shocks and lower economic growth rates as well as an increasing risk of recession changes in consumer sentiment spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors a decline in sales and revenues partner store closures any reduction in air and business travel or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant early termination due to a contractual breach or exercise of other early termination right or other factors including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations or other similar events whether due to the challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise these events particularly early termination and bankruptcies or liquidations could negatively impact the results of operations or financial condition of branded cards retail services or citi as a whole including as a result of loss of revenues increased expenses higher cost of credit impairment of purchased credit card relationships and contractrelated intangibles or other losses see note for information on citis credit card related intangibles generally citis inability in its resolution plan submissions to address any shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance provided could subject citi to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations and could eventually require citi to divest assets or operations title i of the doddfrank act requires citi to prepare and submit a plan to the frb and the fdic for the orderly resolution of citigroup the bank holding company and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code in the event of future material financial distress or failure on november the frb and fdic issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on july by the eight us gsibs including citi the frb and fdic identified one shortcoming but no deficiencies in citis resolution plan the shortcoming related to data integrity and data quality management issues specifically weaknesses in citis processes and practices for producing certain data that could materially impact its resolution capabilities if a shortcoming is not satisfactorily explained or addressed before or in the submission of the next resolution plan the shortcoming may be found to be a deficiency in the next resolution plan for additional information on citis resolution plan submissions see managing global riskliquidity risk below under title i if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that citis resolution plan is not credible which although not defined is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow citi to be resolved in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of citi under the us bankruptcy code and citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies citi could be subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations if within two years from the imposition of any such requirements or restrictions citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies then citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact citis reputation market and investor perception operations and strategy citis performance and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and other strategic initiatives could be negatively impacted if it is not able to compete for retain and motivate highly qualified colleagues recent employment conditions and inflationary pressures have made the competition to hire and retain qualified employees significantly more challenging and costly citis performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified colleagues specifically citis continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business to manage its businesses effectively and to execute its transformation and other strategic initiatives including for example hiring front office colleagues to grow businesses or hiring colleagues to support transformation of its risk controls data and finance infrastructure and compliance depends on its ability to attract new colleagues and to retain and motivate its existing colleagues if citi is unable to continue to attract retain and motivate the most highly qualified colleagues citis performance including its competitive position the execution of its transformation and other strategic initiatives and its results of operations could be negatively impacted citis ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues depends on numerous factors some of which are outside of its control for example the competition for talent recently has been particularly intense and attrition rates have risen due to factors such as low unemployment a strong job market with a large number of open positions and changes in workers expectations concerns and preferences in part due to the pandemic including an increased demand for remote work options and other job flexibility also the banking industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of employee compensation than other industries including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation which can make it unusually challenging for citi to compete in labor markets against businesses including for example technology companies that are not subject to such regulation other factors that could impact its ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues include among other things citis presence in a particular market or region the professional and development opportunities and employee benefits it offers its reputation and its diversity for information on citis colleagues and workforce management see human capital resources and management below citi faces increased competitive challenges including from financial services and other companies and emerging technologies citi operates in an increasingly evolving and competitive business environment which includes both financial and non financial services firms such as traditional banks online banks financial technology companies and others these companies compete on the basis of among other factors size reach quality and type of products and services offered price technology and reputation certain competitors may be subject to different and in some cases less stringent legal and regulatory requirements whether due to size jurisdiction entity type or other factors placing citi at a competitive disadvantage for example citi competes with other financial services companies in the us and globally that continue to develop and introduce new products and services in recent years non traditional financial services firms such as financial technology companies have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions such as citi and have sought bank charters to provide these services these firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals to borrow save and invest money emerging technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry for example despite recent turmoil in the digital asset market there is sustained interest from clients and investors in digital assets financial services firms and other market participants have begun to offer services related to those assets however citi may not be able to provide the same or similar services for legal or regulatory reasons and due to increased compliance and other risks in addition changes in the payments space eg instant and 24x7 payments are accelerating and as a result certain of citis products and services could become less competitive increased competition and emerging technologies have required and could require citi to change or adapt its products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively with competitors including new market entrants simultaneously as citi develops new products and services leveraging emerging technologies new risks may emerge that if not designed and governed adequately may result in control gaps and in citi operating outside of its risk appetite for example instant and 24x7 payments products could be accompanied by challenges to forecasting and managing liquidity as well as increased operational and compliance risks moreover citi relies on third parties to support certain of its product and service offerings which may put citi at a disadvantage to competitors who may directly offer a broader array of products and services also citis businesses results of operations and reputation may suffer if any third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings whether due to operational incidents or otherwise for additional information see the operational processes and systems cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors below to the extent that citi is not able to compete effectively with financial technology companies and other firms citi could be placed at a competitive disadvantage which could result in loss of customers and market share and its businesses results of operations and financial condition could suffer for additional information on citis competitors see the cobrand and private label cards and qualified colleagues risk factors above and supervision regulation and other competition below operational risks a failure or disruption of citis operational processes or systems could negatively impact its reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition citis global operations rely heavily on its technology including the accurate timely and secure processing management storage and transmission of confidential transactions data and other information as well as the monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex transactions in real time citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and clientspecific information for its consumer and institutional customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions citis operations must also comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates with the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the internet mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and customers and clients increasing use of online banking and trading systems and other platforms large global financial institutions such as citi have been and will continue to be subject to an everincreasing risk of operational loss failure or disruption including as a result of cyber or information security incidents for additional information see the cybersecurity risk factor below although citi has continued to upgrade its technology including systems to automate processes and enhance efficiencies operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources not all of which are fully within citis control these include among others human error such as manual transaction processing errors which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties operational or execution failures or deficiencies by third parties insufficient or limited straightthrough processing between legacy systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy systems leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses accidental system or technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure or other similar losses or damage to citis property or assets see also the climate change risk factor above for example citi has experienced and could experience further losses associated with manual transaction processing errors including erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by citi traders that cause system and market disruptions and losses for citi and its clients irrespective of the sophistication of the technology utilized by citi there will always be some room for human error in view of the large transactions in which citi engages such errors could result in significant losses while citi has change management processes in place to appropriately upgrade its operational processes and systems to ensure that any changes introduced do not adversely impact security and operational continuity such change management can fail or be ineffective operational incidents can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with which citi does business such as failures by internet mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures or processes safeguard their systems or prevent system disruptions or cyberattacks incidents that impact information security andor technology operations may cause disruptions andor malfunctions within citis businesses eg the temporary loss of availability of citis online banking system or mobile banking platform as well as the operations of its clients customers or other third parties in addition operational incidents could involve the failure or ineffectiveness of internal processes or controls given citis global footprint and the high volume of transactions processed by citi certain failures errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified which would further increase the consequences and costs operational incidents could result in financial losses as well as misappropriation corruption or loss of confidential and other information or assets which could significantly negatively impact citis reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition cyberrelated and other operational incidents can also result in legal and regulatory actions or proceedings fines and other costs see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below for information on citis management of operational risk see managing global riskoperational risk below citis and third parties computer systems and networks will continue to be susceptible to an increasing risk of continually evolving sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in the theft loss misuse or disclosure of confidential client or customer information damage to citis reputation additional costs to citi regulatory penalties legal exposure and financial losses citis computer systems software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers disruptions of service phishing malware ransomware computer viruses or other malicious code cyberattacks and other similar events these threats can arise from external parties including cyber criminals cyber terrorists hacktivists individuals or groups using cyberattacks to promote a political or social agenda and nationstate actors as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities the increasing use of mobile and other digital banking platforms and services cloud technologies and connectivity solutions to facilitate remote working for citis employees all increase citis exposure to cybersecurity risks citis wind down of its businesses in russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks for additional information about citis exposures related to its russia operations see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and managing global riskother riskscountry risk russia below third parties with which citi does business as well as retailers and other third parties with which citis customers do business may also be sources of cybersecurity risks particularly where activities of customers are beyond citis security and control systems for example citi outsources certain functions such as processing customer credit card transactions uploading content on customerfacing websites and developing software for new products and services these relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by thirdparty hosting of or access to citi websites which could lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code resulting in security breaches impacting citi customers furthermore because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearing houses including as a result of derivatives reforms over the last few years citi has increased exposure to cyberattacks through third parties while many of citis agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions citi may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under these provisions to adequately offset any losses citi may incur from thirdparty cyber incidents citi and some of its thirdparty partners have been subject to attempted and sometimes successful cyberattacks from external sources over the last several years including i denial of service attacks which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers ii hacking and malicious software installations intended to gain unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems iii data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account data and iv malicious software attacks on client systems in attempts to gain unauthorized access to citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client transactions while citis monitoring and protection services were able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they became significant they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents there can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again and they could occur more frequently via novel tactics and on a more significant scale further although citi devotes significant resources to implement maintain monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security because the techniques used to initiate cyberattacks change frequently or in some cases are not recognized until launched or even later citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or otherwise proactively address these methods in addition given the evolving nature of cyber threat actors and the frequency and sophistication of the cyber activities they carry out the determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber incident may not become apparent for a substantial period of time following discovery of the incident also while citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing such as performing security control assessments of thirdparty vendors and limiting thirdparty access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions these actions cannot prevent all thirdpartyrelated cyberattacks or data breaches cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal confidential or proprietary customer client or employee information damage to citis reputation with its clients and the market customer dissatisfaction and additional costs to citi including expenses such as repairing systems replacing customer payment cards credit monitoring or adding new personnel or protection technologies cyber incidents can also result in regulatory penalties loss of revenues exposure to litigation and other financial losses including loss of funds to both citi and its clients and customers and disruption to citis operational systems for additional information on the potential impact of operational disruptions see the operational processes and systems risk factor above moreover the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms cybersecurity protection services and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance protection of consumers personal data while citi maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self insured deductibles cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and may not take into account reputational harm the costs of which are impossible to quantify for additional information about citis management of cybersecurity risk see managing global riskoperational riskcybersecurity risk below changes or errors in accounting assumptions judgments or estimates or the application of certain accounting principles could result in significant losses or other adverse impacts us gaap requires citi to use certain assumptions judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements including among other items the estimate of the acl reserves related to litigation regulatory and tax matters valuation of dtas the fair values of certain assets and liabilities and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment these assumptions judgments and estimates are inherently limited because they involve techniques including the use of historical data in many circumstances that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which citi operates nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes for example many models used by citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not hold in times of market stress limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances if citis assumptions judgments or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events citi could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts some of which could be significant citi could also experience declines in its stock price be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and incur fines and other losses for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing citis financial statements see significant accounting policies and significant estimates below and notes and for example the cecl methodology requires that citi provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan portfolios and other financial assets as applicable at the time those assets are originated or acquired this estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses citis acl estimate depends upon its cecl models and assumptions forecasted macroeconomic conditions including among other things the us unemployment rate and us inflationadjusted gross domestic product real gdp and the credit indicators composition and other characteristics of citis loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets these model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time resulting in variability in citis acl and thus impact its results of operations and financial condition as well as regulatory capital due to the cecl phasein for additional information on the cecl phasein see the capital return risk factor above moreover citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that are reported in the cta components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in accordance with us gaap a sale substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations such as those related to citis remaining divestitures or legacy businesses would result in reclassification of any foreign cta component of aoci related to that foreign operation including related hedges and taxes into citis earnings for example in the second quarter of citi incurred a cta loss net of hedges in aoci released to earnings of approximately million million aftertax related to the substantial liquidation of a legacy uk consumer operation for additional information see legacy franchises and corporateother above and note for additional information on citis accounting policy for foreign currency translation and its foreign cta components of aoci see notes and changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations could have a material impact on how citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations periodically the financial accounting standards board fasb issues financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of citis financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective including those areas where citi is required to make assumptions or estimates changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations whether promulgated or required by the fasb the sec banking regulators or others could present operational challenges and could also require citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally andor with respect to particular businesses see note for additional information on citis accounting policies and changes in accounting including the expected impacts on citis results of operations and financial condition if citis risk management processes strategies or models are deficient or ineffective citi may incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and mitigation processes and strategies including the use of models in enacting processes and strategies as well as in analyzing and monitoring the various risks citi assumes in conducting its activities for example citi uses models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives across the company citi also relies on data to aggregate assess and manage various risk exposures management of these risks is made more challenging within a global financial institution such as citi particularly given the complex diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which citi operates as well as that losses can occur unintentionally from untimely inaccurate or incomplete processes and data as discussed below in october citigroup and citibank entered into consent orders with the frb and occ that require citigroup and citibank to make improvements in various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls see citis consent order compliance above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citis risk management processes strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques including the use of historical data in many circumstances assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which citi operates nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes for example many models used by citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not necessarily hold in times of market stress limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances citi could incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted if citis risk management processes including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner strategies or models are deficient or ineffective such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial regulatory or risk reporting moreover citis basel iii regulatory capital models including its credit market and operational risk models currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval which may result in refinements modifications or enhancements required or otherwise to these models citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the occ and frb prior to implementing certain riskweighted asset treatments as well as certain model changes resulting in a more challenging environment within which citi must operate in managing its riskweighted assets modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the us banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to citi have resulted in and could continue to result in significant changes to citis riskweighted assets these changes can negatively impact citis capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital requirements credit risks credit risk and concentrations of risk can increase the potential for citi to incur significant losses citi has credit exposures to consumer corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the us and various countries and jurisdictions globally including endof period consumer loans of billion and endofperiod corporate loans of billion at december for additional information on citis corporate and consumer loan portfolios see managing global riskcorporate credit and consumer credit below a default by a borrower or other counterparty or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral exposes citi to credit risk despite citis target client strategy various macroeconomic geopolitical and other factors among other things can increase citis credit risk and credit costs particularly for certain sectors industries or countries for additional information see the cobranding and private label credit card and macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below for example a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their obligations as well as result in citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to citi citi is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses additionally due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in marketwide losses while citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures as applicable such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events under the cecl accounting standard the acl reflects expected losses which has resulted in and could lead to additional volatility in the allowance and the provision for credit losses as forecasts of economic conditions change for additional information see the incorrect assumptions or estimates and changes to financial accounting and reporting standards

see each respective businesss results of operations above and managing global riskcredit risk and managing global riskother riskscountry risk below and notes and concentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography especially credit and market risks can also increase citis risk of significant losses for example citi routinely executes a high volume of securities trading derivative and foreign exchange transactions with nonus sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry including banks insurance companies investment banks governments central banks and other financial institutions moreover citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations for additional information about these exposures see note a rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in related or dependent industries and such conditions could cause citi to incur significant losses liquidity risks citis businesses results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted if it does not effectively manage its liquidity as a large global financial institution adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to citis businesses citis liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control such as general disruptions in the financial markets governmental fiscal and monetary policies regulatory changes or negative investor perceptions of citis creditworthiness unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources citi competes with other banks and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits which represent citis most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding the competition for deposits has continued to increase in recent years including as a result of online banks and digital banking and fixed income alternatives for customer funds furthermore it is expected that the market for deposits will become more competitive in the current higher interest rate environment citis costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads for example during interest rates in the us increased significantly thus affecting citis cost of funding changes in citis credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to citi such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or citis financial prospects and can be highly volatile for additional information on citis primary sources of funding see managing global riskliquidity risk below citis ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater extent than expected or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis citis ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets a sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of underwriting and capital markets activity in addition clearing organizations central banks clients and financial institutions with which citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions which could further impair citis liquidity if citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity its businesses results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted in addition as a holding company citigroup inc relies on interest dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations several of citis us and nonus subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments including any local regulatory stress test requirements and interaffiliate arrangements entered into in connection with citigroup incs resolution plan citigroup incs brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses limitations on the payments that citigroup inc receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity a bank holding company is required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks as a result the frb may require citigroup inc to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of citigroup inc or its shareholders or creditors reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations credit rating agencies continuously review the credit ratings of citi and certain of its subsidiaries and a ratings downgrade could adversely impact citis funding and liquidity the credit rating agencies such as fitch ratings moodys investors services and sp global ratings continuously evaluate citi and certain of its subsidiaries their ratings of citi and its rated subsidiaries longterm debt and shortterm obligations are based on several factors including the financial strength of citi and such subsidiaries as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of citi and its subsidiaries such as the agencies proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings and outlooks rating downgrades could negatively impact citi and its rated subsidiaries ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on citi and its rated subsidiaries ability to obtain funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers which could require citi and its rated subsidiaries to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements in addition a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers and on contractual provisions and other credit requirements of citis counterparties and clients that may contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for citi to hold thirdparty funds furthermore a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to citi or are not possible to quantify some of citis counterparties and clients could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties of which citi may or may not be aware certain of citis corporate customers and trading counterparties among other clients could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments with citi in response to ratings downgrades changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only citis funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain citi businesses for additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in citis or citibanks credit ratings see managing global risk liquidity risk below compliance risks ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes and heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the us and globally have increased citis compliance regulatory and other risks and costs citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the us and other jurisdictions in which it does business which may overlap or conflict across jurisdictions resulting in substantial compliance regulatory and other risks and costs in addition there are heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the us and globally for large financial institutions as well as their employees and agents with respect to governance infrastructure data climate and risk management practices and controls these requirements and expectations also include among other things those related to customer and client protection market practices antimoney laundering and increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes a failure to comply with these requirements and expectations even if inadvertent or resolve any identified deficiencies could result in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions enforcement proceedings penalties and fines for additional information on such regulatory consequences see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below over the past several years citi has been required to implement a significant number of regulatory and legislative changes including new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes across its businesses and functions and these changes continue the changes themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation and will require continued investments in citis global operations and technology solutions in some cases citis implementation of a regulatory or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules examples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include i various laws relating to the limitation of crossborder data movement andor collection and use of customer information including data localization and protection and privacy laws which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to other laws including antimoney laundering laws and ii the us banking agencies regulatory capital rules and requirements which have continued to evolve for additional information see the capital return risk factor and capital resources above in addition certain us regulatory agencies and nonus authorities have prioritized issues of social economic and racial justice and are in the process of considering ways in which these issues can be mitigated including through rulemaking supervision and other means even while congress is signaling and certain us state governments are pursuing potentially conflicting antiesg priorities citi is subject to extensive legal and regulatory proceedings examinations investigations consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries that could result in significant monetary penalties supervisory or enforcement orders business restrictions limitations on dividends changes to directors andor officers and collateral consequences arising from such outcomes at any given time citi is a party to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations additionally citi remains subject to governmental and regulatory investigations consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries citi could also be subject to enforcement proceedings not only because of violations of laws and regulations but also due to failures as determined by its regulators to have adequate policies and procedures or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis as previously disclosed the october frb and occ consent orders require citigroup and citibank to implement targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls these improvements will result in continued significant investments by citi during and beyond as an essential part of citis broader transformation efforts to enhance its risk controls data and finance infrastructure and compliance although there are no restrictions on citis ability to serve its clients the occ consent order requires citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition including any portfolio or business acquisition excluding ordinary course transactions moreover the occ consent order provides that the occ has the right to assess future civil money penalties or take other supervisory andor enforcement actions such actions by the occ could include imposing business restrictions including possible limitations on the declaration or payment of dividends and changes in directors andor senior executive officers more generally the occ andor the frb could take additional enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes that citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above the global judicial regulatory and political environment has generally been challenging for large financial institutions and financial institutions have been subject to continued regulatory scrutiny the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of citis operations also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and authorities in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in foreign jurisdictions as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions violations of law by other financial institutions may also result in regulatory scrutiny of citi responding to regulatory inquiries and proceedings can be time consuming and costly us and nonus regulators have been increasingly focused on the culture of financial services firms including citi as well as conduct risk a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents including third parties that could harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such as improperly creating selling marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto failures to safeguard a partys personal information or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest in addition to the greater focus on conduct risk the general heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and other inquiries as well as remediation requirements more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings civil litigation and higher compliance and other risks and costs further while citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented in addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in citis culture such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings moreover the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which citi is subject has remained elevated us and certain nonus governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against or have sought criminal convictions from financial institutions and individual employees and criminal prosecutors in the us have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements against financial entities and individuals and other criminal sanctions for those institutions and individuals these types of actions by us and international governmental entities may in the future have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers and business and the inability to offer certain products or services andor operate certain businesses citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies consent orders sanctions substantial fines and penalties remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future including for matters or practices not yet known to citi any of which could materially and negatively affect citis businesses business practices financial condition or results of operations require material changes in citis operations or cause citi reputational harm additionally many large claimsboth private civil and regulatoryasserted against citi are highly complex slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories the outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings although citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements citis estimates of and changes to these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above in addition certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved for further information on citis legal and regulatory proceedings see note other risks citis emerging markets presence subjects it to various risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs during emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately of citis total revenues citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in latin america asia other than japan australia and new zealand and central and eastern europe the middle east and africa in emea citis presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks such as limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments foreign currency volatility including devaluations and continued strength in the us dollar sustained increases in interest rates sovereign debt volatility election outcomes regulatory changes and political events foreign exchange controls including inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and uncertainties and volatility including with respect to russia and china see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and managing global riskother riskscountry risk russia and ukraine below limitations on foreign investment sociopolitical instability including from hyperinflation fraud nationalization or loss of licenses restrictions arising from retaliatory russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business sanctions or asset freezes potential criminal charges closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets and these risks can be exacerbated in the event of a deterioration in relationships between the us and an emerging market country for example citi operates in several countries that have or have had in the past strict capital controls currency controls andor sanctions such as argentina and russia that limit its ability to convert local currency into us dollars and or transfer funds outside of those countries for instance due to currency controls in argentina citi faces a risk of devaluation on its unhedged argentine pesodenominated assets which continue to increase for additional information on argentinarelated risks see managing global risk other riskscountry riskargentina below moreover if the economic situation in a country in which citi operates were to deteriorate below a certain level us regulators through the interagency country exposure review committee icerc may impose mandatory loan loss or other reserve requirements on citi which would increase its credit costs and decrease its earnings in addition political turmoil and instability and geopolitical tensions and conflicts such as the russia ukraine war have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe which have required and may continue to require management time and attention and other resources such as monitoring the impact of sanctions on certain emerging market economies as well as impacting citis businesses results of operations and financial conditions in affected countries the transition away from and discontinuance of libor or any other interest rate benchmark could have adverse consequences for citi libor and other rates or indices deemed to be benchmarks have been the subject of ongoing us and nonus regulatory scrutiny and reform the libor administrator ceased publication of nonusd libor and oneweek and twomonth usd libor on a permanent or representative basis on december with plans for all other usd libor tenors to permanently cease or become nonrepresentative after june as a result citi ceased entering into new contracts referencing usd libor as of january other than for limited circumstances where regulators recognized that it may be appropriate for banks to enter into new usd libor contracts including with respect to market making hedging or novations of usd transactions executed before january through a global effort by the financial services industry and regulators alternative reference rates have been identified andor developed and are being used to replace libor and other benchmark rates alternative reference rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of libor and may fluctuate differently than and not be representative of libor in order to compensate for these differences certain of citis financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment however there can be no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of libor either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements moreover the transition presents challenges related to contractual mechanics of existing contracts that reference usd libor and are governed by nonus law or reference the usd libor ice swap rate certain of these legacy instruments and contracts are not covered by any legislative solution and do not provide for fallbacks to alternative reference rates which makes it unclear what the applicable future replacement benchmark rates and associated payments might be after the current benchmarks cessation citi may be unable to amend certain instruments and contracts due to an inability to obtain sufficient levels of consent from counterparties or security holders although this will depend on the precise contractual terms of the instrument such consent requirements are often conditions of securities such as floating rate notes the financial conduct authority fca a uk regulator has proposed that one three and sixmonth usd libor be published on a synthetic basis which would only be available through september in addition the transition away from and discontinuance of libor and other benchmark rates have subjected financial institutions including citi to heightened scrutiny from regulators failure to successfully transition away from libor and other benchmark rates could result in adverse regulatory actions disputes including potential litigation involving holders of
