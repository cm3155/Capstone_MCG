described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors since the third quarter of citi has employed enhanced ire methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes included among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions notably accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes resulted in a higher impact to citis net interest income over a 12month period under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment

to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis

instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their clientfacing products such

securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income is larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward parallel rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities for other currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of march citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis cta in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency

with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis cet1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis

and russiarelated exposures resulting in a net decrease in total russia exposure of billion as shown in the table above as well as a change in the composition of its exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced citis thirdparty credit risk see discussion below the sequential decline in exposure was driven by i a billion decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against the us dollar ii decreases in local currency terms of a billion reduction in deposits held within the central bank of russia driven by client deposit withdrawals iii a billion decrease due to loan repayments and sales iv a billion reduction in reverse repo balances and v a billion reduction of thirdparty crossborder exposures the decline in exposure was partially offset by an increase of billion in exposure in local currency terms driven by billion of dividends received by citi as custodian for investor clients in russia that citi was unable to remit due to regulatory restrictions partially offset by payments to clients and tax authorities the decline in overall exposure was also driven by a modest reduction in exposures to russian counterparties not held by ao citibank citis continued risk mitigation efforts

these processes may require citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of

investors regulators and the public citis response to the war in ukraine including any action or inaction may have a negative impact on citis reputation with some or all of these parties for example citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its current presence in russia and association with russian individuals or entities whether subject to sanctions or not including citis inability to support its global clients in russia which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving russian assets or interests failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations including those related to sanctions perceived misalignment of citis actions to its stated strategy in russia and the reputational impact from citis activity and engagement with ukraine or with nonrussian clients exiting their russia businesses citi has considered the potential for reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks citi established a russia special review process with managements reputation risk committee with oversight for significant russiarelated reputation risks and completed a number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a russian nexus while citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in russia citi will continue to manage those operations during the winddown process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations also sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact citis reputation in addition citi currently performs services for conducts business with or deals in nonsanctioned russian owned businesses and russian assets this has attracted and will likely continue to attract negative attention despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country cessation of new business and client originations and reduction of other
