competitive position regulatory environment and commodity prices facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given

transportation citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of march since the onset of the covid19 pandemic citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligorspecific factors have changed particularly where additional stress has been seen as obligor risk ratings are downgraded the probability of default increases downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses in addition downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk or may result in citis seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector citi will continue

securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding

funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank as of march citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits unchanged from the prior quarter for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above market risk market risk emanates from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information

the us dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was million for a bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of march includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above citi decreased its net interest revenue exposure due to an increase in interest rates the decrease was predominantly in us dollar exposure which was million as of march primarily driven by an increase in investment securities the relatively small quarterly change in the estimated impact to aoci primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of citi treasurys investment securities and related interest rate derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates citi expects that the negative impact to aoci would be offset in stockholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio over a period of time as of march citi expects that the negative billion impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately months the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products in addition in the table below the magnitude of the impact to citis net interest revenue and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities in millions

instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of march citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on citis tce and common equity tier capital ratio are shown in the table below for additional information on the changes in aoci see note to the consolidated financial statements in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted

assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets as of december the addon was as set forth in the table below citis average trading var increased to million at march from million at

effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to

and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions as of march there were no backtesting exceptions observed for citis regulatory var for the prior months
