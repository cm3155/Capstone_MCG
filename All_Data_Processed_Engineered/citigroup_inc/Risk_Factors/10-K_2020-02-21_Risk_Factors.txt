risk factors the following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the material risks and uncertainties that could impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition other risks and uncertainties including those not currently known to citi or its management could also negatively impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition thus the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties that citi may face for additional information about risks and uncertainties that could impact citi see executive summary and each respective business results of operations above and managing global risk below the following risk factors are categorized to improve the readability and usefulness of the risk factor disclosure and while the headings and risk factors generally align with citis risk categorization in certain instances the risk factors may not directly correspond with how citi categorizes or manages its risks marketrelated risks macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties globally could have a negative impact on citis businesses and results of operations in addition to the significant macroeconomic challenges posed by the pandemic see the pandemicrelated risk factor below citi has experienced and could experience in the future negative impacts to its businesses and results of operations as a result of other macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges uncertainties and volatility for example the recent action of russian military forces and support personnel in ukraine has escalated tensions between russia and the us nato the eu and the uk the us has imposed and is likely to impose material additional financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain russian organizations andor individuals with similar actions either implemented or planned by the eu and the uk and other jurisdictions during the week of february the us the uk and the eu each imposed packages of financial and economic sanctions that in various ways constrain transactions with numerous russian entities and individuals transactions in russian sovereign debt and investment trade and financing to from or in certain regions of ukraine citis ability to engage in activity with certain consumer and institutional businesses in russia and ukraine or involving certain russian or ukrainian businesses and customers is dependent in part upon whether such engagement is restricted under any current or expected us eu and other countries or uk sanctions and laws sanctions and export controls as well as any actions by russia could adversely affect citis business activities and customers in and from russia and ukraine moreover actions by russia and any further measures taken by the us or its allies could have negative impacts on regional and global financial markets and economic conditions for additional information about these and other related risks see the operational processes and systems cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors below for additional information about citis exposures in russia see managing global riskother riskscountry riskrussia below additionally governmental fiscal and monetary actions or expected actions such as changes in interest rate policies and any program implemented by a central bank to change the size of its balance sheet could significantly impact interest rates economic growth rates the volatility of global financial markets foreign exchange rates and global capital flows further it remains uncertain to what extent central banks may keep interest rates low or whether central banks might raise interest rates or reduce the size of their balance sheets particularly as inflationary pressures continue and the us and global economies continue to improve while earlier in the pandemic the federal reserve board frb and other central banks took actions to support the global economy including by further reducing their benchmark interest rates mismatches between supply and demand of goods and services contributed to a rise in inflation in prompting the frb to announce the approaching end of the period of extraordinarily low interest rates interest rates on loans citi makes are typically based off or set at a spread over a benchmark interest rate and would likely decline or rise as benchmark rates decline or rise respectively while the interest rates at which citi pays depositors are already low and unlikely to decline much further declining or continued low interest rates for loans could further compress citis net interest income citis net interest income could also be adversely affected due to a flattening of the interest rate yield curve eg a lower spread between shorterterm versus longerterm interest rates as citi similar to other banks typically pays interest on deposits based on shorterterm interest rates and earns money on loans based on longerterm interest rates in contrast an abrupt and sustained increase in interest rates could interfere with the global macroeconomic recovery whether due to continued or increased inflationary pressures or otherwise and while citi estimates its overall net interest income would generally increase due to higher interest rates higher rates could adversely affect citis funding costs levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or product revenues for additional information on citis interest rate risk see managing global riskmarket risknet interest income at risk below additional areas of uncertainty include among others an elevated level of inflation resulting in adverse spillover effects the ability of congress to raise the federal debt ceiling slowing of the chinese economy including negative economic impacts associated with such slowdown or any policy actions significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets other geopolitical tensions and conflicts protracted or widespread trade tensions financial market other economic and political disruption driven by antiestablishment movements natural disasters other pandemics and election outcomes for example citis marketmaking businesses can suffer losses resulting from the widening of credit spreads due to unanticipated changes in financial markets in addition adverse developments or downturns in one or more of the worlds larger economies would likely have a significant impact on the global economy or the economies of other countries because of global financial and economic linkages these and additional global macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges uncertainties and volatilities have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition including its credit costs revenues across icg and gcb and aoci which would in turn negatively impact citis book and tangible book value strategic risks rapidly evolving challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic in the us and globally will likely continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses and results of operations and financial condition the covid19 pandemic has affected all of the countries and jurisdictions in which citi operates including severely impacting global health financial markets consumer and business spending and economic conditions the extent of the future pandemic impacts remain uncertain and will likely evolve by region country or state largely depending on the duration and severity of the public health consequences including the duration and further spread of the coronavirus as well as any variants becoming more prevalent and impactful further production distribution acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines availability and efficiency of testing the public response and government actions the future impacts to global economic conditions may include among others further disruption of global supply chains higher inflation higher interest rates significant disruption and volatility in financial markets additional closures reduced activity and failures of many businesses leading to loss of revenues and net losses further institution of social distancing and restrictions on businesses and the movement of the public in and among the us and other countries and reduced us and global economic output the pandemic has had and may continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses and overall results of operations and financial condition which could be material the extent of the impact on citis operations and financial performance including its ability to execute its business strategies and initiatives will continue to depend significantly on future developments in the us and globally such developments are uncertain and cannot be predicted including the course of the coronavirus as well as any weakness or slowing in the economic recovery or a further economic downturn whether due to further supply chain disruptions inflation trends higher interest rates or otherwise the pandemic may not be sufficiently contained for an extended period of time a prolonged health crisis could reduce economic activity in the us and other countries resulting in additional declines or weakness in employment trends and business and consumer confidence these factors could negatively impact global economic activity and markets cause a continued decline in the demand for citis products and services and in its revenues further increase citis credit and other costs and may result in impairment of longlived assets or goodwill these factors could also cause an increase in citis balance sheet riskweighted assets and acl resulting in a decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures as well as regulatory demands for higher capital levels andor limitations or reductions in capital distributions such as common share repurchases and dividends moreover any disruption or failure of citis performance of or its ability to perform key business functions as a result of the continued spread of covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect citis operations the impact of the pandemic on citis consumer and corporate borrowers will vary by sector or industry with some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels particularly as credit and customer assistance support further winds down which could lead to increased pressure on their results of operations and financial condition increased borrowings or credit ratings downgrades thus likely leading to higher credit costs for citi these borrowers include among others businesses that are more directly impacted by the institution of social distancing the movement of the public and store closures in addition stress levels ultimately experienced by citis borrowers may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in prior estimates or models used by citi resulting in an increase in citis acl or net credit losses particularly as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and government support programs diminish ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the us and globally to address the economic impact from the pandemic could further affect citis businesses operations and financial performance citi could also face challenges including legal and reputational and scrutiny in its efforts to provide relief measures such efforts have resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions and regulatory and government actions and proceedings such actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines adverse to citi in addition the different types of government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with varying degrees of effectiveness citi has taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its colleagues however these measures could result in additional expenses and illness of employees could negatively affect staffing for a period of time in addition citis ability to recruit hire and onboard colleagues in key areas could be negatively impacted by pandemic restrictions as well as citis covid19 vaccination requirement see the qualified colleagues risk factor below further it is unclear how the macroeconomic or business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic the postpandemic environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial markets fiscal monetary tax and regulatory environments and consumer customer and corporate client behavior these developments and changes could have an adverse impact on citis results of operations and financial condition ongoing business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make citis longerterm business balance sheet and strategic and budget planning more difficult or costly citi and its management and businesses may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in this environment to the extent that it is not able to adapt or compete effectively citi could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer see the competitive challenges risk factor below citis ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets substantially depends on regulatory capital requirements including the results of the ccar process and regulatory stress tests citis ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets whether through its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program substantially depends among other things on regulatory capital requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which is based upon the results of the ccar process required by the frb as well as the supervisory stress tests required under the dodd frank act as described in more detail below citis ability to return capital also depends on its results of operations and financial condition the capital impact related to divestitures forecasts of macroeconomic conditions its implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework and effectiveness in planning managing and calculating its level of riskweighted assets under both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach supplementary leverage ratio slr and global systemically important bank holding company gsib surcharge which has been made more challenging due to elevated levels of liquidity in the financial system related to the pandemic see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor above changes in regulatory capital rules requirements or interpretations could have a material impact on citis regulatory capital both as a result of changes in citis reported regulatory capital and integration into the ccar process and regulatory stress tests for example citi was required to adopt the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr as of january which resulted in an approximate billion increase in citis riskweighted assets under the standardized approach citi voluntarily suspended common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of in anticipation of the adverse impact resulting from the adoption of saccr citi will be required to adopt saccr for purposes of the supervisory stress test during the cycle and saccr may be considered by management during the cycle for purposes of managements own capital adequacy assessment in addition the us banking agencies may potentially consider a number of changes to the us regulatory capital framework in the future including but not limited to revisions to the us basel iii rules recalibration of the gsib surcharge and slr and enactment of the discretionary countercyclical capital buffer all of these potential changes could negatively impact citis regulatory capital position or increase citis regulatory capital requirements all ccar firms including citi will continue to be subject to a rigorous regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices including but not limited to governance risk management and internal controls citis ability to return capital may be adversely impacted if such an evaluation of citi resulted in negative findings in addition citis ability to accurately predict interpret or explain to stakeholders the results of the ccar process and thus to address any market or investor perceptions may be limited as the frbs assessment of citis capital adequacy is conducted using the frbs proprietary stress test models for additional information on limitations on citis ability to return capital to common shareholders as well as the ccar process supervisory stress test requirements and gsib surcharge see capital resourcesoverview and capital resources stress testing component of capital planning above and the risk management risk factor below the frb has stated that it expects leading capital adequacy practices to continue to evolve and to likely be determined by the frb each year as a result of its crossfirm review of capital plan submissions similarly the frb has indicated that as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements several parameters of the annual stress testing process may continue to be altered including the severity of the stress test scenario the frb modeling of citis balance sheet preprovision net revenue ppnr and stress losses and the addition of components deemed important by the frb beginning january citi was required to phase into regulatory capital at per year the changes in retained earnings deferred tax assets and acl determined upon the january cecl adoption date as well as subsequent changes in the acl between january and december the frb has stated that it plans to maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the supervisory stress test cycle while continuing to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework the impacts on citis capital adequacy of the frbs incorporation of cecl in its supervisory stress tests on an ongoing basis and of other potential regulatory changes in the frbs stress testing methodologies remain unclear for additional information regarding the cecl methodology including the transition provisions related to the adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the cecl methodology see capital resourcescurrent regulatory capital standards regulatory capital treatmentmodified transition of the current expected credit losses methodology above and note to the consolidated financial statements in addition the frb has integrated the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements for citigroup the scb equals the maximum decline in citis common equity tier capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario over a ninequarter ccar measurement period plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends subject to a minimum requirement of effective october citis scb was the scb is calculated by the frb using its proprietary data and modeling of each firms results accordingly citis scb may change annually or possibly more frequently based on the supervisory stress test results thus potentially resulting in volatility in the calculation of the scb similar to the other regulatory capital buffers a breach of the scb would result in graduated limitations on capital distributions for additional information on the scb including its calculation see capital resourcesregulatory capital buffers above although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of and the ultimate impact to citi from these changes to the frbs regulatory capital stress testing and ccar regimes these changes could increase the level of capital citi is required or elects to hold including as part of citis management buffer thus potentially impacting the extent to which citi is able to return capital to shareholders citi its management and its businesses must continually review analyze and successfully adapt to ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes in the us and globally despite the adoption of final regulations and laws in numerous areas impacting citi and its businesses over the past several years citi its management and its businesses continually face ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes both in the us and globally while the areas of ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes facing citi are too numerous to list completely various examples include but are not limited to i potential fiscal monetary regulatory tax and other changes arising from the us federal government and other governments including as a result of the differing priorities of the current us presidential administration changes in regulatory leadership or focus and actions of congress or in response to the pandemic ii potential changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to citi see the capital return risk factor and capital resourcesregulatory capital standards developments above and iii future legislative and regulatory requirements in the us and globally related to climate change including any new disclosure requirements see the climate change risk factor below when referring to regulatory citi is including both formal regulation and the views and expectations of its regulators in their supervisory roles us and international regulatory and legislative initiatives have not always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis and areas of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to the scope interpretation timing structure or approach leading to inconsistent or even conflicting requirements including within a single jurisdiction for example in may the european commission adopted as part of capital requirements directive v crd v a new requirement for major banking groups headquartered outside the eu which would include citi to establish an intermediate eu holding company where the foreign bank has two or more institutions broadly meaning banks brokerdealers and similar financial firms established in the eu while in some respects the requirement mirrors an existing us requirement for nonus banking organizations to form us intermediate holding companies the implementation of the eu holding company requirement could lead to additional complexity with respect to citis resolution planning capital and liquidity allocation and efficiency in various jurisdictions moreover ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes make citis and its managements longterm business balance sheet and strategic budget planning difficult subject to change and potentially more costly us and other regulators globally have implemented and continue to discuss various changes to certain regulatory requirements which would require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to citi its businesses and business planning for example while the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms and revised market risk framework have been finalized at the international level there remain significant uncertainties with respect to the integration of these revisions into the us regulatory capital framework business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes which can change dramatically upon finalization or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide and such guidance can change regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly increased citis compliance risks and costs see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below and can adversely affect citis businesses results of operations and financial condition citis continued investment and other initiatives as part of its transformation and strategic refresh may not be as successful as it projects or expects as part of its transformation initiatives citi continues to make significant investments to improve its infrastructure risk management and controls and further enhance safety and soundness for additional information see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citi also continues to execute on its strategic refresh that includes among other things its exit of certain consumer banking businesses see below and its investments to deepen client relationships and enhance client offerings and capabilities in order to simplify the company and enhance its allocation of resources for example citi continues to invest in its technology and digital capabilities across the franchise including digital platforms and mobile and cloudbased solutions in addition citi has been making other investments across the company such as in citis wealth management business commercial banking business treasury and trade solutions securities services and other businesses including implementing new capabilities and partnerships citi has also been pursuing productivity improvements through various technology and digital initiatives organizational simplification and location strategies failure to properly invest in and upgrade citis technology and processes could result in an inability to be sufficiently competitive serve clients effectively and avoid operational errors for additional information see the operational processes and systems risk factor below there is no guarantee that these or other initiatives citi may pursue will be as productive or effective as citi expects or at all furthermore citis strategic refresh necessitates further changes in and exits of certain businesses which involve significant execution complexity and could result in additional losses charges or other negative financial impacts for example citi may not be able to achieve its objectives related to its exits of consumer markets in asia and emea or exit of the consumer small business and middlemarket banking operations in mexico these exits may not be as productive effective or timely as citi expects and may result in additional foreign currency translation adjustments cta or other losses charges or other negative financial or strategic impacts which could be material for additional information on cta losses see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor below citis investment and other initiatives may continue to evolve as its business strategies the market environment and regulatory expectations change which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement and limit their effectiveness moreover citis ability to achieve expected returns on its investments and costs savings depends in part on factors that it cannot control including among others interest rates inflation impacts related to the pandemic customer client and competitor actions and ongoing regulatory changes citis ability to utilize its dtas and thus reduce the negative impact of the dtas on citis regulatory capital will be driven by its ability to generate us taxable income at december citis net dtas were billion net of a valuation allowance of billion of which billion was deducted from citis common equity tier capital under the us basel iii rules primarily relating to net operating losses foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards for additional information see capital resourcescomponents of citigroup capital above of the net dtas at december billion related to foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards net of a valuation allowance the carryforward utilization period for ftcs is years and represents the most timesensitive component of citis dtas the ftc carryforwards at december expire over the period of citi must utilize any ftcs generated in the thencurrentyear tax return prior to utilizing any carryforward ftcs the accounting treatment for realization of dtas including ftcs is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies forecasts of future taxable earnings will depend upon various factors including among others the continued impact of the pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions in addition any future increase in us corporate tax rates could result in an increase in citis dta which may subject more of citis existing dta to exclusion from regulatory capital while improving citis ability to utilize its ftc carryforwards citis overall ability to realize its dtas will primarily be dependent upon its ability to generate us taxable income in the relevant tax carryforward periods although utilization of ftcs in any year is generally limited to of foreign source taxable income in that year overall domestic losses odl that citi has incurred in the past allow it to reclassify domestic source income as foreign source failure to realize any portion of the net dtas would have a corresponding negative impact on citis net income and financial returns citi has not been and does not expect to be subject to the base erosion antiabuse tax beat which if applicable to citi in any given year would have a significantly adverse effect on both citis net income and regulatory capital for additional information on citis dtas including ftcs see significant accounting policies and significant estimatesincome taxes below and notes and to the consolidated financial statements citis interpretation or application of the complex tax laws to which it is subject could differ from those of the relevant governmental authorities which could result in litigation or examinations and the payment of additional taxes penalties or interest citi is subject to various incomebased tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities as well as the numerous nonus jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are inherently complex and citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws including the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform to its entities operations and businesses in addition citi is subject to litigation or examinations with us and nonus tax authorities regarding nonincomebased tax matters citis interpretations or application of the tax laws including with respect to tax reform withholding stamp service and other nonincome taxes could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority which could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes penalties or interest which could be material for additional information on the litigation and examinations involving nonus tax authorities see note to the consolidated financial statements a deterioration in or failure to maintain citis cobranding or private label credit card relationships including as a result of early termination bankruptcy or liquidation could have a negative impact on citis results of operations or financial condition citi has cobranding and private label relationships through its branded cards and retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and merchants globally whereby in the ordinary course of business citi issues credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants the five largest relationships across both businesses in north america gcb constituted an aggregate of approximately of citis revenues in for additional information see global consumer bankingnorth america gcb above citis cobranding and private label agreements provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term over the last several years a number of us retailers have continued to experience declining sales due to the pandemic or otherwise which has resulted in significant numbers of store closures and in a number of cases bankruptcies as retailers attempt to cut costs and reorganize in addition as has been widely reported competition among card issuers including citi for these relationships is significant and it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to maintain such relationships on the same terms or at all citis cobranding and private label relationships could be negatively impacted by among other things the general economic environment changes in consumer sentiment spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors a decline in sales and revenues partner store closures government imposed restrictions reduced air and business travel or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant early termination due to a contractual breach or exercise of other early termination right or other factors including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations or other similar events whether due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic or otherwise see the pandemicrelated risk factor above while various mitigating factors could be available to citi if any of the above events were to occursuch as by replacing the retailer or merchant or offering other card productsthese events particularly early termination and bankruptcies or liquidations could negatively impact the results of operations or financial condition of branded cards retail services or citi as a whole including as a result of loss of revenues increased expenses higher cost of credit impairment of purchased credit card relationships and contractrelated intangibles or other losses for information on citis credit card related intangibles generally see note to the consolidated financial statements citis inability in its resolution plan submissions to address any shortcomings or deficiencies identified or guidance provided by the frb and fdic could subject citi to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations and could eventually require citi to divest assets or operations title i of the doddfrank act requires citi to prepare and submit a plan to the frb and the fdic for the orderly resolution of citigroup the bank holding company and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code in the event of future material financial distress or failure the eight us gsibs including citi filed their most recent resolution plans with the frb and fdic on july for additional information on citis resolution plan submissions see managing global riskliquidity risk below under title i if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that citis resolution plan is not credible which although not defined is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow citi to be resolved in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of citi under the us bankruptcy code and citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies citi could be subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations if within two years from the imposition of any such requirements or restrictions citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies then citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact citis reputation market and investor perception operations and strategy citis performance and the performance of its individual businesses could be negatively impacted if citi is not able to effectively compete for retain and motivate highly qualified colleagues recent employment conditions have made the competition to hire and retain qualified employees significantly more challenging citis performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified colleagues specifically citis continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business to manage its businesses effectively and to execute its global strategy depends on its ability to attract new colleagues and to retain and motivate its existing colleagues if citi is unable to continue to attract retain and motivate the most highly qualified colleagues citis performance including its competitive position the execution of its strategy and its results of operations could be negatively impacted citis ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues depends on numerous factors some of which are outside of its control for example the competition for talent recently has been particularly intense because of economic conditions associated with the pandemic also the banking industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of employee compensation than other industries including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation which can make it unusually challenging for citi to compete in labor markets against businesses that are not subject to such regulation citi often competes for talent with such businesses including among others technology companies further citis vaccination requirement for its usbased employees could make it more difficult to compete for or retain colleagues other factors that could impact its ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues include among other things citis presence in a particular market or region the professional opportunities it offers and its reputation for information on citis colleagues and workforce management see human capital resources and management below financial services companies and others as well as emerging technologies pose increasingly competitive challenges to citi citi operates in an increasingly evolving and competitive business environment which includes both financial and nonfinancial services firms such as traditional banks online banks financial technology companies and others these companies compete on the basis of among other factors size reach quality and type of products and services offered price technology and reputation certain competitors may be subject to different and in some cases less stringent legal and regulatory requirements placing citi at a competitive disadvantage citi competes with financial services companies in the us and globally that continue to develop and introduce new products and services in recent years nonfinancial services firms such as financial technology companies have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions such as citi and have sought bank charters to provide these services these firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals to borrow save and invest money moreover emerging technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry for example there is increasing interest from clients and investors in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies financial services firms and other market participants have begun to offer services related to those assets such as custody and trading however citi may not be able to provide the same or similar services for legal or regulatory reasons and such services increase compliance risk in addition changes in the payments space eg instant and 24x7 payments are accelerating and as a result certain of citis products and services could become less competitive in addition as discussed above it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted as a result of the pandemic citi may experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in a postpandemic environment increased competition and emerging technologies have required and could require citi to change or adapt its products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively with competitors including new market entrants simultaneously as citi develops new products and services leveraging emerging technologies new risks may emerge that if not designed and governed adequately may result in control gaps and in citi operating outside of its risk appetite for example instant and 24x7 payments products could be accompanied by challenges to forecasting and managing liquidity as well as increased operational and compliance risks to the extent that citi is not able to compete effectively with financial technology companies and other firms citi could be placed at a competitive disadvantage which could result in loss of customers and market share and its businesses results of operations and financial condition could suffer for additional information on citis competitors see the cobrand and private label cards and qualified colleagues risk factors above and supervision regulation and other competition below operational risks a failure or disruption of citis operational processes or systems could negatively impact citis reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition citis global operations rely heavily on its technology including the accurate timely and secure processing management storage and transmission of confidential transactions data and other information as well as the monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex transactions in real time for example citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and clientspecific information for its consumer and institutional customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions citis operations must also comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates with the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the internet mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions large global financial institutions such as citi have been and will continue to be subject to an everincreasing risk of operational loss failure or disruption including as a result of cyber or information security incidents these risks have been exacerbated during the pandemic when a substantial portion of citis colleagues have worked remotely and customers and clients have increased their use of online banking and other platforms for additional information see the pandemicrelated risk factor above and the cybersecurity risk factor below although citi has continued to upgrade its technology including systems to automate processes and enhance efficiencies operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources not all of which are fully within citis control these include among others human error such as manual transaction processing errors fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties accidental system or technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure or other similar losses or damage to citis property or assets see also the climate change risk factor below for example citi has experienced and could experience further losses associated with manual transaction processing errors for additional information see revlonrelated wire transfer litigation in note to the consolidated financial statements irrespective of the sophistication of the technology utilized by citi there will always be some room for human error in view of the large transactions in which citi engages such errors could result in significant loss operational incidents can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with which citi does business such as failures by internet mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures or processes safeguard their systems or prevent system disruptions or cyber attacks incidents that impact information security andor technology operations may cause disruptions andor malfunctions within citis businesses eg the temporary loss of availability of citis online banking system or mobile banking platform as well as the operations of its clients customers or other third parties in addition operational incidents could involve the failure or ineffectiveness of internal processes or controls given citis global footprint and the high volume of transactions processed by citi certain failures errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified which would further increase the consequences and costs operational incidents could result in financial losses as well as misappropriation corruption or loss of confidential and other information or assets which could significantly negatively impact citis reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition cyberrelated and other operational incidents can also result in legal and regulatory proceedings fines and other costs see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below for information on citis management of operational risk see managing global riskoperational risk below citis and third parties computer systems and networks have been and will continue to be susceptible to an increasing risk of continually evolving sophisticated cybersecurity activities that could result in the theft loss misuse or disclosure of confidential client or customer information damage to citis reputation additional costs to citi regulatory penalties legal exposure and financial losses citis computer systems software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks and other similar events these threats can arise from external parties including cyber criminals cyber terrorists hacktivists and nationstate actors as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities third parties with which citi does business as well as retailers and other third parties with which citis customers do business may also be sources of cybersecurity risks particularly where activities of customers are beyond citis security and control systems for example citi outsources certain functions such as processing customer credit card transactions uploading content on customerfacing websites and developing software for new products and services these relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by thirdparty hosting of or access to citi websites which could lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code resulting in security breaches impacting citi customers furthermore because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearing houses including as a result of derivatives reforms over the last few years citi has increased exposure to cyber attacks through third parties while many of citis agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions citi may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under the provisions to adequately offset any losses citi may incur from thirdparty cyber incidents citi has been subject to attempted and sometimes successful cyber attacks from external sources over the last several years including i denial of service attacks which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers ii hacking and malicious software installations intended to gain unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems iii data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account data and iv malicious software attacks on client systems in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client transactions while citis monitoring and protection services were able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they became significant they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents there can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale further although citi devotes significant resources to implement maintain monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security because the methods used to cause cyber attacks change frequently or in some cases are not recognized until launched or even later citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or proactively address these methods until they are discovered in addition given the evolving nature of cyber threat actors and the frequency and sophistication of the cyber activities they carry out the determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber incident may not become apparent for a substantial period of time following discovery of the incident also while citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing such as performing security control assessments of thirdparty vendors and limiting thirdparty access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions these actions cannot prevent all thirdpartyrelated cyber attacks or data breaches cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal confidential or proprietary customer or client information damage to citis reputation with its clients and the market customer dissatisfaction and additional costs to citi including expenses such as repairing systems replacing customer payment cards credit monitoring or adding new personnel or protection technologies regulatory penalties loss of revenues exposure to litigation and other financial losses including loss of funds to both citi and its clients and customers and disruption to citis operational systems could also result from cyber incidents for additional information on the potential impact of operational disruptions see the operational processes and systems risk factor above moreover the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms cybersecurity protection services and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance protection of consumers personal data while citi maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions including significant selfinsured deductibles cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and may not take into account reputational harm the cost of which could be immeasurable for additional information about citis management of cybersecurity risk see managing global riskoperational riskcybersecurity risk below changes to or the application of incorrect assumptions judgments or estimates in citis financial statements could cause significant unexpected losses or impacts in the future us gaap requires citi to use certain assumptions judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements including among other items the estimate of the acl reserves related to litigation regulatory and tax matters exposures valuation of dtas the fair values of certain assets and liabilities and the assessment of goodwill or other assets for impairment if citis assumptions judgments or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events citi could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts some of which could be significant for example the cecl methodology requires that citi provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan portfolios and other financial assets as applicable at the time those assets are originated or acquired this estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses citis acl estimate depends upon its cecl models and assumptions forecasted macroeconomic conditions including among other things us unemployment rate and us real gdp and the credit indicators composition and other characteristics of citis loan and other applicable financial assets these model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time whether due to the pandemic or otherwise resulting in greater variability in citis acl compared to its provision for loan losses under the previous gaap methodology and thus impact its results of operations and financial condition as well as regulatory capital due to the cecl phasein beginning january moreover citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that are reported in the cta components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in accordance with us gaap a sale substantial liquidation or any other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations such as those related to citis legacy or exit businesses would result in reclassification of any foreign cta component of aoci related to that foreign operation including related hedges and taxes into citis earnings for example citi incurred a pretax loss of approximately million million aftertax in the third quarter of related to the sale of citis australia consumer banking business in asia gcb primarily reflecting the impact of a cta loss for additional information on citis

assumptions and estimates are used in preparing citis financial statements including those related to citis acl see significant accounting policies and significant estimates below and notes and to the consolidated financial statements changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations could have a material impact on how citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations periodically the financial accounting standards board fasb issues financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of citis financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective including those areas where citi is required to make assumptions or estimates changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations whether promulgated or required by the fasb or other regulators could present operational challenges and could also require citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally andor with respect to particular businesses for additional information on citis accounting policies and changes in accounting including the expected impacts on citis results of operations and financial condition see note to the consolidated financial statements if citis risk management processes strategies or models are deficient or ineffective citi may incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and mitigation processes and strategies including use of models in enacting processes and strategies as well as in analyzing and monitoring the various risks citi assumes in conducting its activities for example citi uses models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives across the company citi also relies on data to aggregate assess and manage various risk exposures management of these risks is made even more challenging within a global financial institution such as citi particularly given the complex diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which citi operates as well as that losses can occur unintentionally from untimely inaccurate or incomplete processes in addition in october citigroup and citibank entered into consent orders with the frb and occ that require citigroup and citibank to make improvements in various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls see citis consent order compliance above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citis risk management processes strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques including the use of historical data in many circumstances assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which citi operates nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes citi could incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted if citis risk management processes including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner strategies or models are deficient or ineffective such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial regulatory or risk reporting moreover citis basel iii regulatory capital models including its credit market and operational risk models currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval which may result in refinements modifications or enhancements required or otherwise to these models modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the us banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to citi have resulted in and could continue to result in significant changes to citis riskweighted assets these changes can negatively impact citis capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital requirements credit risks credit risk and concentrations of risk can increase the potential for citi to incur significant losses credit risk primarily arises from citis lending and other businesses in both icg and gcb citi has credit exposures to consumer corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the us and various countries and jurisdictions globally including endofperiod consumer loans of billion and endofperiod corporate loans of billion at yearend a default by a borrower or other counterparty or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral exposes citi to credit risk despite citis target client strategy various macroeconomic geopolitical and other factors among other things can increase citis credit risk and credit costs particularly for certain sectors industries or countries for additional information see the pandemicrelated cobranding and private label credit card and macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below for example a weakening of economic conditions including higher unemployment levels can adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their obligations in addition weakening economic conditions may result in citi being unable to liquidate its collateral as well as disputes with counterparties regarding the valuation of collateral citi holds and citi being unable to realize the fair value of such collateral while citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures as applicable such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events under the cecl accounting standard the acl reflects expected losses rather than incurred losses which has resulted in and could lead to additional volatility in the allowance and the provision for credit losses as forecasts of economic conditions change in addition citis future allowance may be affected by seasonality of its cards portfolio balances based on historical evidence showing that i credit card balances typically decrease during the first and second quarters as borrowers use tax refunds to pay down balances and ii balances increase during the third and fourth quarters each year as payments are no longer impacted by tax refunds and the holiday season approaches however these seasonal trends could be affected in due to the impacts of the pandemic government stimulus and expiration of consumer and small business relief programs for

results of operations above and managing global riskcredit risk and managing global riskother riskscountry risk below and notes and to the consolidated financial statements concentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography especially credit and market risks can also increase citis risk of significant losses as of yearend citis most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies for additional information including concentrations of credit risk to other public sector entities see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition citi routinely executes a high volume of securities trading derivative and foreign exchange transactions with nonus sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry including banks insurance companies investment banks governments central banks and other financial institutions moreover citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations for additional information about these exposures see note to the consolidated financial statements a rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could cause citi to incur significant losses liquidity risks the maintenance of adequate liquidity and funding depends on numerous factors including those outside of citis control such as market disruptions and increases in citis credit spreads as a large global financial institution adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to citis businesses citis liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control such as general disruptions in the financial markets governmental fiscal and monetary policies regulatory changes or negative investor perceptions of citis creditworthiness unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements and the inability to monetize available liquidity resources whether due to the pandemic or otherwise citi competes with other banks and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits which represent citis most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding the competition for deposits has continued to increase in recent years including among others as a result of online banks and digital banking furthermore although citi has had robust deposit growth since the onset of the pandemic it remains unclear how sticky likely to remain at citi those deposits may be particularly in a less monetarily accommodative environment moreover citis costs to obtain and access secured funding and longterm unsecured funding are directly related to its credit spreads and changes in interest and currency exchange rates changes in credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to citi such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or citis financial prospects and can be highly volatile for additional information on citis primary sources of funding see managing global riskliquidity risk below citis ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or if market appetite declines as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis a sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or lengthier dislocation of underwriting and capital markets activity in addition clearing organizations central banks clients and financial institutions with which citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral based on their perceptions or the market conditions which could further impair citis access to and cost of funding in addition as a holding company citi relies on interest dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations several of citis us and nonus subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments including any local regulatory stress test requirements citis brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses limitations on the payments that citi receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity a bank holding company is required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks as a result the frb may require citi to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of citi or its shareholders or creditors reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations in addition in the event of a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization citis right to participate in a distribution of such subsidiarys assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors the credit rating agencies continuously review the credit ratings of citi and certain of its subsidiaries and a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on citis funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs including derivatives triggers that could require cash obligations or collateral requirements the credit rating agencies such as fitch moodys and sp global ratings continuously evaluate citi and certain of its subsidiaries their ratings of citi and its more significant subsidiaries longterm senior debt and shortterm commercial paper are based on a number of factors including standalone financial strength as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of citi and its subsidiaries such as the agencies proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings a ratings downgrade could negatively impact citis ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on citis funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers which could require citi to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements in addition a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers and on contractual provisions and other credit requirements of citis counterparties and clients that may contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for citi to hold thirdparty funds some entities could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties of which citi may or may not be aware furthermore a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to citi or are not possible to quantify certain of citis corporate customers and trading counterparties among other clients could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments with citi in response to ratings downgrades changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only citis funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain citi businesses for additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in citis or citibanks credit ratings see managing global riskliquidity risk below compliance risks ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes and heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the us and globally have increased citis compliance regulatory and other risks and costs citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the us and other jurisdictions in which it does business resulting in substantial compliance regulatory and other risks and costs in addition there are heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the us and globally for large financial institutions as well as their employees and agents with respect to governance infrastructure data and risk management practices and controls these requirements and expectations also include among other things those related to customer and client protection market practices antimoney laundering and sanctions a failure to comply with these requirements and expectations or resolve any identified deficiencies could result in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions enforcement proceedings penalties and fines for additional information see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below over the past several years citi has been required to implement a significant number of regulatory and legislative changes across all of its businesses and functions and these changes continue the changes themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation and will require continued investments in citis global operations and technology solutions in some cases citis implementation of a regulatory or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules moreover in some cases there have been entirely new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes resulting in large volumes of regulation and potential uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations for compliance examples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include i various laws relating to the limitation of crossborder data movement andor collection and use of customer information including data localization and protection and privacy laws which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to other laws including antimoney laundering laws ii the frbs total loss absorbing capacity tlac requirements and iii the us banking agencies regulatory capital rules and requirements which have continued to evolve for additional information see the capital return risk factor and capital resources above in addition the us banking agencies have prioritized issues of social economic and racial justice and are in the process of considering ways in which these issues can be mitigated including through rulemaking supervision and other means increased and ongoing compliance and regulatory requirements uncertainties scrutiny and expectations have resulted in higher compliance costs for citi in part due to an increase in risk regulatory and compliance staff over the last several years extensive and changing compliance requirements can also result in increased reputational and legal risks for citi as failure to comply with regulations and requirements or failure to comply with regulatory expectations can result in enforcement andor regulatory proceedings penalties and fines citi is subject to extensive legal and regulatory proceedings examinations investigations consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries that could result in significant monetary penalties supervisory or enforcement orders business restrictions limitations on dividends changes to directors andor officers and collateral consequences arising from such outcomes at any given time citi is a party to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations investigations consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries citi can also be subject to enforcement proceedings not only because of violations of laws and regulations but also due to failures as determined by its regulators to have adequate policies and procedures or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis the october frb and occ consent orders require citigroup and citibank to implement targeted action plans and quarterly progress reports detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls these improvements will result in continued significant investments by citi during and beyond as an essential part of citis broader transformation efforts to enhance its infrastructure governance processes and risk and controls although there are no restrictions on citis ability to serve its clients the occ consent order requires citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition including any portfolio or business acquisition excluding ordinary course transactions moreover the occ consent order provides that the occ has the right to assess future civil money penalties or take other supervisory andor enforcement actions including where the occ determines citibank has not made sufficient and sustainable progress to address the required improvements such actions by the occ could include imposing business restrictions including possible limitations on the declaration or payment of dividends and changes in directors andor senior executive officers more generally the occ andor the frb could take additional enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes that citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above the global judicial regulatory and political environment has generally been challenging for large financial institutions the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of citis operations also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and authorities in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions us and nonus regulators have been increasingly focused on conduct risk a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents including third parties that could harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such as improperly creating selling marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto failures to safeguard a partys personal information or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest in addition to the greater focus on conduct risk the general heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and other inquiries as well as remediation requirements more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings civil litigation and higher compliance and other risks and costs further while citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms including citi in addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in citis culture such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings furthermore the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which citi is subject has remained elevated us and certain nonus governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against or have sought criminal convictions from financial institutions and individual employees and criminal prosecutors in the us have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements against corporate entities and individuals and other criminal sanctions for those institutions and individuals these types of actions by us and international governmental entities may in the future have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers and business and the inability to offer certain products or services andor operate certain businesses citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies consent orders sanctions substantial fines and penalties remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future including for matters or practices not yet known to citi any of which could materially and negatively affect citis businesses business practices financial condition or results of operations require material changes in citis operations or cause citi reputational harm further many large claimsboth private civil and regulatoryasserted against citi are highly complex slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories the outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings although citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements citis estimates of and changes to these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above in addition certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved other risks citis presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs during emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately of citis total revenues citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in latin america asia other than japan australia and new zealand and central and eastern europe the middle east and africa in emea although citi continues to pursue its target client strategy citis presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks such as limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments foreign currency volatility including devaluations sovereign volatility election outcomes regulatory changes and political events foreign exchange controls including inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms macroeconomic volatility and disruptions including with respect to commodity prices limitations on foreign investment sociopolitical instability including from hyperinflation fraud nationalization or loss of licenses business restrictions sanctions or asset freezes potential criminal charges closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets whether related to geopolitical conflicts or otherwise and these risks can be exacerbated in the event of a deterioration in relationships between the us and an emerging market country for example citi operates in several countries that have or have had in the past strict capital and currency controls such as argentina that limit its ability to convert local currency into us dollars andor transfer funds outside of those countries among other things citi faces a risk of devaluation on its unhedged argentine pesodenominated assets which continue to increase for further information on this and other risks see managing global riskother riskscountry riskargentina below moreover if the economic situation in an emerging markets country in which citi operates were to deteriorate below a certain level us regulators may impose mandatory loan loss or other reserve requirements on citi which would increase its credit costs and decrease its earnings for further information see managing global riskother risks country riskargentina below in addition political turmoil and instability have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe which have required and may continue to require management time and attention and other resources such as monitoring the impact of sanctions on certain emerging markets economies as well as impacting citis businesses and results of operations in affected countries climate change could have a negative impact on citis results of operations and financial condition citi operates in countries states and regions in which many of its businesses and the activities of many of its customers and clients are exposed to the adverse impacts of climate change as well as uncertainties related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy climate change presents both immediate and longterm risks to citi and its customers and clients with the risks expected to increase over time climate risks can arise from both physical risks those risks related to the physical effects of climate change and transition risks risks related to regulatory compliance technological stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a lowcarbon economy the physical and transition risks can manifest themselves differently across citis risk categories in the short medium and long terms the physical risk from climate change could result from increased frequency andor severity of adverse weather events for example adverse weather events could damage or destroy citis or its counterparties properties and other assets and disrupt operations making it more difficult for counterparties to repay their obligations whether due to reduced profitability asset devaluations or otherwise these events could also increase the volatility in financial markets affecting citis trading businesses and increase its counterparty exposures and other financial risks which may result in lower revenues and higher cost of credit transition risks may arise from changes in regulations or market preferences toward a lowcarbon economy which in turn could have negative impacts on asset values results of operations or the reputations of citi and its customers and clients for example citis corporate credit exposures include oil and gas power and other industries that may experience reduced demand for carbonintensive products due to the transition to a lowcarbon economy moreover us and nonus banking regulators and others are increasingly focusing on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions both directly and with respect to their clients as an example on december the occ requested feedback on draft principles designed to support the identification and management of climaterelated financial risks at institutions with more than billion in total consolidated assets even as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climaterelated information by companies across sectors there may continue to be a lack of information for more robust climaterelated risk analyses third party exposures to climaterelated risks and other data generally are limited in availability and variable in quality modeling capabilities to analyze climaterelated risks and interconnections are improving but remain incomplete legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climaterelated risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs for additional information see the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes risk factor above in addition citi could face increased regulatory reputational and legal scrutiny as a result of its climate risk sustainability and other esg related commitments for information on citis climate and other sustainability initiatives see sustainability and other esg matters below for additional information on citis management of climate risk see managing global riskother risksclimate risk below the transition away from and discontinuance of the london interbank offered rate libor and any other interest rate benchmark could have adverse consequences for market participants including citi for decades libor and other rates or indices deemed to be benchmarks have been widely used across financial products and markets globally these benchmarks have been the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory scrutiny and reform resulting in regulators generally expecting or requiring banks including citi to cease entering into new contracts that reference usd libor as a benchmark by december the libor administrator ceased publication of nonusd libor and oneweek and twomonth usd libor on a representative basis on december with plans to cease publication of all other usd libor tenors on june as a result citi ceased entering into new contracts referencing usd libor as of january other than for limited purposes as permitted by regulatory guidance libor and other benchmarks have been used in a substantial number of citis outstanding securities and products including among others derivatives corporate loans commercial and residential mortgages credit cards securitized products and other structured securities despite ongoing actions to prepare for the transition away from libor see managing global riskother riskslibor transition risk below market participants including citi may not be adequately prepared for uncertainties associated with these benchmarks discontinuance or as necessary be able to successfully modify their outstanding contracts or products that reference these benchmarks for example the transition away from and discontinuance of libor or any other benchmark rate presents various uncertainties and operational legal reputational or compliance financial and other risks and challenges to holders of these contracts and products as well as financial markets and institutions including citi these include among others the pricing liquidity observability value of return on and market for financial instruments and contracts that reference libor or any other benchmark rate while citi has adopted alternative reference rates for new contracts to replace these outgoing benchmarks in some instances it is possible that the characteristics of these new rates may not be sufficiently similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmark rates that they are intended to replace alternative reference rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of libor and may fluctuate differently than and not be representative of libor in order to compensate for these differences certain of citis financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment however there can be no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of libor either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements further investors counterparties and other market participants may not consider the new alternative rates to be a suitable substitute or successor for all of the purposes for which these benchmarks have historically been used including without limitation as a representation of the unsecured shortterm funding costs of banks which may in turn reduce their market acceptance any failure of the alternative rates to gain broad market acceptance could adversely affect market demand for citis products or securities linked to such alternative rates and thus market prices of such instruments as part of its transition citi is relying or has relied on guidance provided by the accounting standard setters related to the transition away from libor in the event that such guidance is insufficient or otherwise unable to be implemented as intended libor transition could disrupt citis hedge accounting relationships andor lead to increased costs in connection with determining whether contract amendments result in a modification or an extinguishment from an accounting perspective changes in observability of the alternative reference rates could impact the fair value hierarchy classification of financial instruments and contracts moreover the libor transition presents challenges related to contractual mechanics of existing financial instruments and contracts that reference such benchmarks that mature after discontinuance of the relevant benchmark certain of these legacy instruments and contracts do not provide for fallbacks to alternative reference rates which makes it unclear what the applicable future replacement benchmark rates and associated payments might be after the current benchmarks cessation citi may not be able to amend certain instruments and contracts due to an inability to obtain sufficient levels of consent from counterparties or security holders although this will depend on the precise contractual terms of the instrument such consent requirements are often conditions of securities such as floating rate notes even if the instruments and contracts provide for a transition to an alternative reference rate the new rate may particularly in times of financial stress significantly differ from the prior rates as a result citi may need to consider proactively addressing any contractual uncertainties or rate differences in such instruments and contracts which would likely be both time consuming and costly and may not ultimately be successful while statutory solutions have been enacted in certain jurisdictions to address these contractual concerns for example the state of new york and the eu the availability and effectiveness of these statutory mechanisms to cover all impacted financial instruments and products to which citi is a party is uncertain in addition the transition away from and discontinuance of libor and other benchmark rates have subjected financial institutions including citi to heightened scrutiny from regulators failure to successfully transition away from libor and other benchmark rates could result in adverse regulatory actions disputes including potential litigation involving holders of outstanding products and contracts that reference libor and other benchmark rates and reputational harm to citi citi may also need to further invest in and develop internal systems and infrastructure to transition to alternative benchmark rates to manage its businesses and support its clients
