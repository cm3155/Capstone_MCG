liz and good morning everyone today we reported earnings for the third quarter of we had net income of billion and earnings per share of we continue to navigate the covid19 pandemic extremely well credit costs have stabilized deposits continued to increase and revenues are up yearto date as you know last week we entered into consent orders with the federal reserve and the occ and i will discuss how were approaching those after i go through our business and financial performance our institutional clients group continues to perform extremely well investment banking had another strong quarter accessing the capital markets for our clients and private bank revenues are now up yeartodate treasury and trade solutions the backbone of our global network is down only for the quarter and for the year in constant dollars despite significantly lower interest rates trading performance was strong as well with fixed income and equities up and respectively yearto date global consumer banking revenues remain under pressure due to the economic impact of the pandemic predominantly driven by the decline in credit card spending citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 at the same time deposits continued to increase significantly credit costs decreased and we saw more investment activity from our wealth management clients on balance our global consumer banking franchise has shown resilience in light of the challenges were facing our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity tier ratio increasing to well above our regulatory minimum of our tangible book value per share increased to up from a year ago and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders over time turning to the consent orders they focus on four areas that impact our risk and control environment risk management data governance controls and compliance what ties these areas together is the need to modernize our infrastructure governance and processes weve had remediation programs in place and while weve been making progress in these areas were simply not where we need to be while this is disappointing were committed to thoroughly addressing the issues identified in the orders and modernizing our bank as many of you know weve been making structural changes in accelerating investments weve centralized program management and learn from unsparing root cause analysis from outside firms were laserfocused on reducing manual touch points automating processes and ensuring accurate data can be accessed quickly when were producing management and regulatory reports more importantly were making strengthening our risk and control environment and achieving operational excellence a strategic priority for the firm going forward this wont be a quick or easy fix we need to conduct an indepth gap analysis to ensure our solutions are tailored to the issues we face and get us to the necessary end state while we cant fully scope out the costs yet for a multiyear transformation i can tell you with certainty that were committing all the necessary resources while continuing to serve our clients importantly were aligned with our regulators as far as timelines are concerned so well not jeopardize the quality or completeness for speed collectively these investments will not only further enhance our safety and soundness theyll also create a digital infrastructure that will make us more efficient more competitive and significantly improve our ability to serve our clients and customers so these are investments we need to make in hindsight we should have done them faster and prevented it from coming to this but our firm has made tremendous progress in recent years whether its derisking our balance sheet or improving our efficiency and business performance to close the gap in returns with our competitors our foundation is sound stable and secure our performance during this pandemic shows the progress weve made achieving excellence in our risk and control environment and our operations is necessary for citi to take the next step forward our franchise is made up of committed and capable people who make us proud every day theyve done everything asked of them and i know theyll continue to do so in the times ahead ahead of the transition in february jane is driving this transformation and the entire management team is committed to getting citi to where it needs to be and doing it the right way with that mark will go through the presentation and then wed be happy to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide citigroup reported third quarter net income of billion which included a modest increase in credit reserves of roughly million this quarter reported results also include the million civil money penalty in connection with the consent orders that mike just mentioned which negatively impacted eps by for the quarter revenues of billion declined from the prior year while trading and investment banking remained strong this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of activity in consumer expenses were up yearoveryear as we continue to invest in infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment credit costs of billion were meaningfully lower relative to the first half of the year our effective tax rate was for the third quarter looking at yeartodate results we delivered net income of over billion even as we increased credit reserves by roughly billion we grew revenues by predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses while expenses increased yearoveryear allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a increase in operating margin in constant dollars endofperiod loans declined yearoveryear to billion reflecting a higher level of repayments across institutional and consumer as well as a slowdown in draws in our institutional businesses and lower spending activity in consumer deposits grew with consistent client engagement reflecting the benefits of our global platform across both the institutional and consumer franchises which also serve to strengthen our available liquidity and three quarters of the way through the year we continue to manage well through this crisis with significant capital and liquidity as well as a significant cushion in the form of credit reserves as of september our cet1 capital ratio was close to basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement we have over billion in available liquidity we have more than doubled credit reserves since the end of last year today they stand at nearly billion and including the modest increase taken this quarter our reserve ratio was roughly stable at on funded loans and as we discussed last quarter we feel good about our ability to continue to support our clients as we all manage through this crisis on slide we provide additional detail on reserving actions so far this year as a reminder these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty which provides some room in the event of a more adverse outcome in the first quarter our base scenario reflected a shortlived downturn followed by a recovery in the back half of with unemployment falling to by yearend and fullyear gdp close to prior year levels by the end of the second quarter our base case assumed a more severe and protracted downturn this year but with a sharper recovery into next year and now you can see we are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and gdp through i would note however that our forwardlooking view on a rolling 13quarter basis in unemployment as an example is continuing to improve as we move further beyond the peak of the crisis and our outlook for other variables like vix and oil prices is also important and generally improved this quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 so on a net basis we did not see a significant impact on reserves from the change in our base macro outlook this quarter but we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty which grew from billion to billion during the quarter partially offset by lower loan volumes and other small items today we are factoring in a downside scenario that is more adverse relative to our base case for example we are incorporating a more significant deterioration in us gdp growth rates which is now close to lower than our base case in versus our second quarter outlook that was only lower than the base case so all else being equal if the management adjustment had not changed we would have seen a reserve release of roughly million in the quarter looking at the level of reserves we hold today we believe that we are well prepared for expected credit losses having reserved for something worse than our base case and given the lifetime nature of the cecl methodology and the conservative nature of our management adjustment it is now more likely than not that well see reserve releases and our acl come down in to offset future losses as we continue to progress through the crisis assuming our base case holds although this may be offset somewhat as we would likely need to build additional reserves to cover future loan growth as the economy recovers and we support our clients needs turning now to each business slide shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars gcb delivered ebit of billion while revenues remained under pressure credit costs were down considerably this quarter reflecting a small acl release and lower net credit losses in particular in the us where were seeing a continued benefit from government stimulus and other relief revenues declined as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in asia wealth management was more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions and expenses decreased as lower volumerelated expenses reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in covid19related expenses slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail total third quarter revenues of billion were down from last year branded cards revenues of billion were down reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans as seen across the industry purchase sales have continued to recover during the third quarter up sequentially but still down versus last year at the same time were seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay so while purchase activity has improved our clients are also paying down more quickly resulting in pressure on our loan balances this is creating a revenue headwind but it is also benefiting cost of credit as delinquencies and losses have outperformed our initial expectations for retail services revenues of billion were down yearoveryear reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments net interest revenues were down as average loans declined by on lower purchase sale activity and higher payment rates similar to branded cards purchase sales recovered sequentially this quarter up but remained down yearoveryear higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year reflecting the impact of lower loss expectations in and therefore higher income sharing citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 during the quarter we launched a new digital credit card program with wayfair with this partnership we further diversified our portfolio with a leading ecommerce retailer and now provide half of the top us ecommerce companies in with consumer credit card programs retail banking revenues of billion were down yearoveryear as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads average deposits were up including growth in checking we saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with more than twothirds coming from customers outside of our branch footprint and we will continue to look for opportunities to deepen our relationships with these customers including through our investments in digital wealth capabilities total expenses for north america consumer were down yearoveryear as we managed our marketing and other discretionary expenses while recognizing efficiency savings and lower volumerelated costs which more than offset incremental covid19related expenses total credit cost of billion decreased from last year reflecting lower net credit losses as well as a modest reserve release on slide we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars in asia revenues declined yearoveryear in the third quarter cards revenues declined by reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down yearoveryear were continuing to see a disproportionate impact on asia card revenues from the decline in travel spending including lower travelrelated interchange and foreign transaction fees however our strength in wealth management continued we saw record investment revenues this quarter up reflecting continued strong client engagement with growth in citigold clients and growth in net new money versus last year and average deposit growth remained strong at this quarter turning to latin america total consumer revenues declined yearoveryear similar to other regions we saw good growth in deposits in mexico this quarter with average balances up however deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending revenues were impacted by branch closures and a continued decline in the macro environment in total operating expenses for our international consumer business were down in the third quarter reflecting efficiency savings and lower volumerelated expenses and cost of credit declined to million with lower net credit losses and a modest reserve release this quarter reflecting a change in accounting for thirdparty collection fees slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends as i noted earlier credit trends remain broadly stable to improving this quarter given high levels of liquidity in the us lower spending and the benefits of relief programs however we do expect losses to begin to rise next year and likely peak towards the end of as government stimulus and other programs roll off and unemployment remained elevated turning now to the institutional clients group on slide icg delivered ebit of billion this quarter and billion yeartodate revenues of billion increased in the third quarter as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in tts corporate lending and security services citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 in the third quarter we continued to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses given our highly differentiated global platform our progress in creating new digital solutions for clients and our full service model which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise turning now to the results for the businesses starting with banking total banking revenues of billion declined treasury and trade solution revenues of billion were down as reported and in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues our average deposits were up in constant dollars and we had solid growth in underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown one example of the continued client engagement that we have seen is in instant payments where we are now live in countries and have seen significant client demand for these capabilities investment banking revenues of billion were up from last year reflecting solid growth in capital markets and continued share gains capital markets continued to be extremely strong equity underwriting in particular which allowed us to continue to support our clients in raising liquidity through ipos convertibles and followon offerings private bank revenues of million grew driven by strong client engagement particularly in capital markets as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending corporate lending revenues of million were down as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and while we continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws we also saw significant repayments as we helped our investmentgrade clients access capital markets which led to the decline in endofperiod loans total markets and securities services revenue of billion increased yearoveryear and as weve seen over the prior two quarters we continue to actively make markets for both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through the continued uncertain environment fixed income revenues of billion grew driven by strong performance across spread products and commodities equity revenues of million were up versus last year as solid performance in cash equities and derivatives reflecting strong client volumes and more favorable market conditions were partially offset by lower revenues in prime finance and finally in securities services revenues were down on a reported basis and in constant dollars as higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads total operating expenses of billion increased yearoveryear reflecting continued investments in infrastructure risk management and controls as well as higher compensation costs total credit costs of million were up meaningfully from last year although down significantly on a sequential basis we built million in reserves this quarter the increase is largely due to continued uncertainty in the economic environment going forward as of quarter end our overall funded reserve ratio was including on the noninvestmentgrade portion total net credit losses were million finally total nonaccrual loans declined roughly million sequentially to billion reflecting writeoffs and repayments across the portfolio slide shows the results for corporateother revenues declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates as well as marks on securities expenses were up as the winddown of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure risk management and controls citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 incremental costs associated with covid19 and the million civil money penalty that i mentioned earlier excluding the onetime impact of the penalty the pretax loss for corporateother was million this quarter and looking ahead to the fourth quarter we would expect a similar quarterly pretax loss slide shows our net interest revenue and margin trends in constant dollars total net interest revenue of billion this quarter declined million yearoveryear reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances partially offset by higher tradingrelated nir on a sequential basis net interest revenue declined by roughly million driven by lower loan balances as well as lower tradingrelated nir and net interest margin declined basis points reflecting lower net interest revenues turning to noninterest revenues in the third quarter nonnir declined to billion given lower levels of consumer activity partially offset by strong trading and investment banking revenues yearoveryear as we look to the fourth quarter we expect the continuation of these dynamics with both net interest revenues and noninterest revenues down yearoveryear reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to covid19 as well as a normalization in trading and investment banking activity on slide we show our key capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio improved to driven by net income our supplementary leverage ratio was and our tangible book value per share grew by to driven by net income before i conclude let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter on the top line we expect to see continued pressure in consumer reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to covid and we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our accrual businesses in icg our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends in total we expect this to result in full year revenues that are roughly flat with the decline in net interest revenues more or less offset by noninterest revenues on a fullyear basis consistent with prior guidance on the expense side we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers we are making targeted investments in the franchise where we see the best opportunities for the future and we are accelerating investments to achieve excellence in our risk and control environment and enhance our operations for a fully digital world as a result we could see expenses that are up a couple percent or so on a full year basis turning to credit as i mentioned already if our macro outlook holds we wouldnt expect additional reserve builds but given the remaining uncertainty we are also unlikely to see any material releases this quarter and for the fourth quarter we would expect the level of losses similar to those seen this quarter in summary the environment remained challenging this quarter but we continued to perform well yeartodate we have demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise we ended the quarter with a strong capital liquidity position overall client engagement remained strong we grew book value this quarter and we have remained focused on supporting employees customers clients and communities with that mike and i are happy to take any questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mike just wanted to ask a question in terms of lessons learned on the consent order and the need to invest here i guess the question is why werent these issues addressed earlier was there a misread of regulatory expectations or was management attention and resources just needed elsewhere and you didnt get to it yet hello can you hear me mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc john this is mark can you hear me john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah sorry could you hear the question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes we did hear the question i think mike may be muted mike are you muted mike michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc no can you hear me now mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes we can hear you now thank you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc im sorry mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc im sorry about that john michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc im sorry about that john citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sorry john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research no problem michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so i was saying john that over the past decade or so i think weve done a lot of work in terms of positioning the firm from both a financial and a strategic perspective and i think weve made a number of investments across areas that we felt were critical and were going to continue to make targeted investments at the barclays conference mark spoke about our next phase of our transformation and i think as we kind of think about that we have always been focused in terms of how we operate but i would say we havent gone fast enough that we feel that again i think if you think you look at covid in the way weve come through covid i feel quite proud about kind of what weve done and what weve been able to do obviously not over and weve initiated a number of significant remediation projects along the way to strengthen our controls our infrastructure and our governments but that being said we didnt do it fast enough and weve got to move faster and thats certainly where were going to be focused i think in terms of what the expectation should be in terms of how were going to approach that i think really four pillars that were going to be focused on one is the organizational component and youve seen us already go at that in terms of the establishment and hiring of our chief administrative office and officer karen peetz coming in and i think creating and putting a framework around the way well go at this i would say the strategic component which is really agreeing on what the end state vision for our processes and i think being critical as i said in my opening we have brought people in to give us an external assessment of what needs to be done and where we fell short and i think its making sure that the work that we do comes together across the institution so as opposed to simply addressing specific issues solving holistic problems i think theres an operational component behind this in terms of making sure that around things like data and technology to make sure that were driving the proper automation the elimination of manual touch points and other things that weve spoken about and i think importantly the fourth component is the cultural piece and making sure that all the businesses all the regions all the functions understand that its everyones responsibility to get this right so i would say it hasnt john been from it lack of effort and commitment to it but i would say that we certainly could have ensured a work smarter around getting to the end point john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thats helpful and then a followup for mark mark obviously with the consent orders and the work required additional expense and investment will be needed in the coming years do you still think you can make progress closing the profitability gap to peers citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 will that still be a goal and also if you cant do significant ma or portfolio acquisitions are there opportunities potentially to slim down and simplify the company over time that could help profitability thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks john so the answer is yes i mean our intent is over time to continue to narrow the gap to continue to increase profitability improve returns over time and so that hasnt changed with every crisis in some ways comes a unique opportunity and that is a unique opportunity to take a hard look at your business model and you see corporations around the world having to think through that as they manage through this crisis and similarly we will with the benefit of a new incoming ceo and as well as managing through this crisis well continue to look at our business model continue to look at our strategy and see what makes sense as we come out of this and how we can best capture opportunities to serve our clients john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and one quick followup is it clear to you what will be deemed significant acquisitions or portfolio additions versus ordinary course or is that something thats still to be defined mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its still to be defined but there are some things that are obvious in terms of bau activity in terms of securitizations and other types of activities that we do within different parts of the franchise but we still have to define what significant means and get regulatory agreement on that john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey glenn good morning glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning just a quick followup on the consent just are the expenses going to be inside of corporateother and outside of the businesses and then and related to related to the question is is it clear to you that if and when the group comes off capital return suspension that you will be able to act as any of the other banks will act on on the capital return front citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure in terms of the first question as you heard me mention before were spending more than billion in terms of incremental spend in that is split between corporate as well as some of the other businesses depending on the nature of the spend i would expect that as we go forward it will be a similar dynamic again depending on the nature of the spend would be booked in corporateother or in some of the respective or one of the respective businesses to give a quick example in some of the consulting spend that we do that is meant to help scope out end state vision for a key process for example wed likely book that in corporateother it would serve to benefit the entire franchise and so thats just one example in terms of capital actions going forward theres nothing in the consent order that prevents us from making capital action decisions and taking capital action decisions going forward and so we would expect that wed be able to act similarly to our peers as we come out of this crisis glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi one quick one on cards if i could youre down doubledigits well into doubledigits in asia and mexico but just overall i wonder if you could parse out how much you think thats the macro environment and some of the obvious that youve already spoken on because what were trying to build back to is what takes us to the other side where we have a bottoming out and building off of bottom and that includes how youre marketing meaning are promo and teasers on hold given the macro backdrop and how youre marketing into the banking base thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look there are a couple of different dynamics that i think are important i think the key one you hit on which is were still in the midst of a crisis and so were very much still seeing pressure on purchase sales its better than it was in the prior quarters but there certainly is still pressure there were seeing that across the franchise one of the big drags this quarter you see is retail services thats in part tied to the partner and revenue sharing that we have with partners where an improved forecast in loss expectations ends up resulting in us sharing more revenues with the partners but the dynamic thats important to watch as this plays through is how unemployment how gdp evolves and what that means in the way of purchase activity starting to pick up and thats going to be an important factor we are keeping a close watch on that we have dialed back advertising marketing spend ph of alcon et cetera et cetera and we want to be thoughtful about when we leg back in as we see signs of things turning and so we keep a close watch on that we dont want to be late to that and well be very proactive citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 at getting after it where it makes sense and testing it where we think were seeing good signals that warrant us increasing some of that spend to drive some of the future volume activity that we see but as of right now were seeing the pressure on volumes thats really a direct byproduct of the crisis were managing through glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc good morning maybe just a question a followup on expenses you guys have done a pretty good job over the last few years sort of investing spending on investment and offsetting with efficiency saves obviously that may not happen perfectly this year because of the incremental spend how do we think about that going forward is this rampup start to stabilize next year and you can kind of get back on that path or how do we think about beyond mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look i think that as i mentioned weve got an incremental spend of about billion this year that has gone towards infrastructure risk and controls we started that incremental spend path if you will in so to some extent in our run rate is more spend towards those types of activities there will be an opportunity to look at that spend the billion and recalibrate it or point it in a different direction or reprioritize the spend theres some of it that is a oneyear spend that will have an opportunity to spend again so to speak as we get into and well take advantage of that opportunity the order requires i think a very important step which is that we step back and come up with a target endstate vision for some of these key processes and the risk management controls and compliance around them and i highlight that step because we need to do that in order to appropriately dimension the reprioritization of the spend we already have in our expense base and what incremental spend is necessary and so well do that over the time period thats been allotted to us over within the order it is an investment and i highlight that because many of the things that mike described in terms of automation in terms of reduced manual touch points in terms of straightthrough processing many of those things will yield benefits in the way we run our organization in the citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 way we not only improve our operations but in the way were able to go to market and compete and serve our clients and so i do expect benefits to accrue from these investments down the line and we will separate and away from that because i wont compromise the dollars needed in order to make those improvements in those investments separate and away from that we will continue to be responsible managers of the firm and that means ensuring that we look across the franchise and make sure to ensure that were spending wisely james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and maybe just pivoting to just nii i appreciate the yearoveryear guidance but where and when do you see it kind of stabilizing given where the rate picture is right now mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look i mean there are obviously a lot of factors that play through the quarter and the combination of not only rates but the volumes that had played through are all important factors here let alone the amount of liquidity thats in the market and the impact that that has on the balance sheet id expect for near to stabilize and stay relatively flat as we go into the remainder of the year assuming current trends kind of play out we project some near growth on the accrual businesses as hopefully covid diminishes a little bit however as ive said before the markets near could be somewhat volatile so a little bit hard to predict as you well know but were looking at stabilization as we come through the end of the year here james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc my question is for mike citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc look mike weve agreed a lot about citis improved resiliency since you started citi is simpler stronger and safer and you can look at the cds spreads they were times wider when you came in as ceo and thats progress but what weve disagreed on is the pace and need for more restructuring and so the question is where is the sense of urgency speaking on behalf of investors people i speak with theres a collective sense of extreme disappointment with technology the new regulatory order in tech the root problems were not transparent to investors on execution you didnt go fast enough and you said this new tech fix will take time on the business mix many questions continue on why you have this global consumer footprint which has terrible efficiency and returns worstinclass rotce this quarter even if we give you the from last year thats still below the of jpmorgan this quarter alone so where is the sense of urgency so recognizing the improvement that youve had with the balance sheet but still a long way to go with strategy why not step aside now and have the new ceo jane fraser take over as a way to demonstrate the increased sense of urgency thank you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure yeah so i would start out mike by saying that i think it is important to the board its important to the company that we have a real transition as you recall my transition was about five minutes and as part of this process i did commit to the board that id stay throughout the year and close out the threeyear plan which we announced in we are starting the transition now and i think that allows jane to be very much involved in terms of our financial plan and if you recall when i started i thought it was important kind of going into the budget and planning process that the ceo own that i think i was fortunate in terms of my timing of coming in of that being the case and i think with jane coming in that will very much be the case because she will be accountable for delivering next year and into the future i think its also important that jane has taken on the transformation work and working on the gap analysis and other related things to the consent order as part of that by the way jane continues to have a day job in terms of running consumers shes also overseeing our return to the office in terms of our north american business and i think the orderly transition is the right thing to do i think in terms of the accomplishments i appreciate what you said in terms of some of the acknowledgment but again kind of grounding where we started net income increased from billion to the end of last year north of billion our return on assets went from basis points to right about basis points our return on tangible common equity yes still behind our peers went from to but went a long way towards closing that gap we went from returning hardly any capital in to returning nearly billion over the last six years and returning our share count by about and so i dont think you accomplish those things without a sense of commitment and a sense of urgency and i feel great about the team thats in place and their commitment to that and so i think we have made significant progress and i think janes got a foundation to build on from that and i think she and the team will be kind of focused on those things and again i think coming out of covid as mark talked about here or as and when we citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 come out of covid in the environment i think theres things that they can take advantage of and i think they will and i think theyll certainly act with that sense of urgency mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well as my one followup what can citi do to show more alignment with shareholders because despite all those improvements the stock is still trading at about half of book value where it was eight years ago since citi was formed or since ceo comp is just shy of million when you have worstinclass stock price performance so whether its pay in stock or i mean these problems didnt come out overnight that the regulator has identified so its just youre on a path and now all of a sudden we find out that the engine underneath the company wasnt as strong as it should be and we just i think we speaking with the investors i speak with feel as though shareholders are a secondary consideration after all the other constituencies and what symbolically can citi do if youre not going to step aside and have jane take the reins sooner what else can citi do to show that shareholders actually matter instead of waiting for another maybe three to fouryear plan michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well shareholders absolutely do matter mike and if you kind of look at throughout the firm whether its the pay structure employees and in particular more highly paid employees getting paid significantly in stock or stock related type of instruments of the different programs and scorecards being very linked to how we perform and the things that hopefully over time drive share performance and again i think theres no one thing in particular and so i think getting those metrics right is critical i know the board i know the compensation committee all work hard in terms of trying to create that alignment and again i think from a disclosure perspective weve been kind of very public and transparent in terms of the metrics and the scorecard process that leadership and broader management has held to at the firm mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right if i can squeeze in one more just for mark as you i mean obviously indiscernible with the execution strategy controls transparency but just looking forward now with the financials as far as the expenses mark you were already asked about this youre already spending billion you say some of this is a oneyear spend i guess you have to do a review so you dont really know the exact spending to fix these problems but should we think of billion should we think of billion is it bigger than a bread box again when we hear its not a quick fix its not an easy fix its going to take a while peoples imaginations run wild is this billion is it billion somehow frame this the best that you can again given that youre at the early stages of a more full review mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah mike what i would say is on look if you look back we have been i think quite responsible at managing our investments over the past number of years and what people should expect is that well continue to be responsible around that the second thing id say is that these are investments as i said earlier i think they are necessary investments to improve the way we operate and our ability to compete and these are investments that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 were going to make right its hard to pinpoint a number as youve said i would expect as i mentioned earlier to an earlier question that we would we will continue to increase our profitability we will continue to improve our returns but i cant dimension the number for you next year or the year after except to say we are still running the firm we have performed i think quite well through this crisis there is still a crisis for us to manage through and we will continue to do that with a focus on our clients and responsible management of our overall financials and when we get more clarity on the actual spend and as we get through the budget thats here and the response to the order im sure ill be able to give you more color on that operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning first thanks for taking all the questions i guess it doesnt sound like jane is on the call which is fine its not surprising but when should we expect to hear from her in terms of the transition and kind of her thoughts on the regulatory issues and process forward michael louis a corbat chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i think we should better kind of get her feet under her and go through some of these processes and get educated and start to form her opinions that i described and so well probably start to introduce her on the january call in terms of maybe having more view towards a forward look and then obviously the quarter after that shell have the reins matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc that makes sense and then understanding that there could be more kind of views in the room so to speak but for now just the thoughts on addressing the regulatory issues is that a matter of spending money and fixing the processes you did kind of like allude to there could be some strategic changes so is this the business model that you think citigroup will have going forward or more structural changes potentially coming to address the regulatory issues and better position the company mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me perhaps try and clarify the earlier comment so to be clear we have as mike described a consent order that we need to address and i think importantly when you look at that consent order it is an opportunity for us to take a step back and look at these key processes and the infrastructure controls compliance activity that support them so thats kind of one important step that as responsible managers of the franchise we intend to execute against and some of that weve begun already and that was referenced in the consent orders separate and away from that what i was alluding to was just simply put the idea that we are in a crisis and as you go through a crisis you learn things about your business and as i mentioned we talk to clients all the time theyre learning things about their business as they manage through this crisis were learning things about and identifying opportunities about our business for example the investments that weve made in digital have turned out to be very wise investments as we manage through this crisis what are the opportunities to accelerate that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 type of spend as we go forward given the acceptance of digitization has probably been accelerated by a couple of years now the importance of revenue mix in growing our feebased revenue or the traction that our wealth management business is getting in this type of environment presents opportunities for us to look at how we can expand that aspect of our business and business model so the crisis will create and has created an opportunity for us to take another look on top of that with any new ceo i think you would expect an opportunity for that person to take a step back and take a look at the business that we have take a look at the environment that were playing into and to make an assessment as to what the right path forward is in light of where we think the growth trajectory is and where we think the return opportunities are and so that is the other leg that with jane coming in in february im sure she will want to take that opportunity and see what comes of that so hopefully that clarifies the point matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes it does thanks for the color mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch mark i apologize but im going to have to reask the question that youve been asked many times and im wondering if this could be a successful attempt but as we think about productivity savings versus investments in risk management for is billion or rather billion a good starting point in terms of how we should think about quarterly expenses as we think about the next several quarters mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well the expenses that we have in the quarter that you referenced include obviously a million civil money penalty thats part of that thats booked in operating expenses and in terms of were in the midst of constructing our plan right now and so hard for me to give you an exact number or run rate number for you to forecast in so sorry to disappoint but i dont have much beyond the way ive answered that question already citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay and i guess my second question is to mike and i think its always hard to call out competitors by name but going back to mike mayos set of questions the questions that we as analysts got ever since that journal article came out is why isnt citigroup the new wells fargo in terms of regulatory issues and many investors pointed out that when your consent order came out last week that the asset cap and business activity limitation for wells actually came out two years after the consent order and without listing the things that youve already accomplished and perhaps just looking forward how can you reassure your current investors and prospective investors that youre not going down the same laborious regulatory remediation route as one of your peers which could clearly be impactful in terms of business activity restrictions michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure so i would say one very important part of that erika is what we spoke about in terms of no widespread customer harm the company did not profit from the activities and you can kind of go on with that i think the second piece is that around customer harm and around some of those things there were not just wells fargo but there were kind of widespread industry deep dives into sales practices and other pieces in here i think in this youve seen and weve talked about the four areas of focus and where were going to be spending our time and weve been asked to do the gap analysis weve obviously been at this for a while and we will obviously do a good extensive gap analysis but i think weve got a kind of reasonable idea and again were open to the findings that come from that in terms of the things that need to be done and i think that as importantly in there is kind of the understanding of the process failures that got us here again no fraud no customer harm no benefit around that and if i could just go back and touch on the question that you asked mark i think an important way to think about it is historically youve heard us kind of speak to the way that weve gone at the expense side of things is really working hard to offset the costs that weve been putting out there in terms of some of this transformation work i think the way youre going to hear us talk about it and the way you should think about it is those are separate streams the remediation work will cost what it will cost but dont think as a result of that that theres still not significant work that we recognize that we can do from a business improvement process and so were not linking the two as those necessarily being offsetting but we will continue to work on those things to better the efficiencies of the company away from this i think the second piece is that that while were not speaking to it weve referenced it i think that this work will have this transformation will have an roi in terms of what this allows us to do and do differently we talked about from the client and customer perspective the business process in terms of the way we aggregate data the way that we kind of move risk and controls through the firm in a more automated way we think gives us the ability not just to improve the process but we do think that over time it will have a return in terms of the benefits and costs that are associated with those both directly and indirectly operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so maybe a question for mark pertaining to capital one of the things that has happened recently is that the advanced cet1 has now become your binding constraint and one of the key questions that weve been getting or and was an expectation that we would see a significant uptick in rwas relating to operational risk and it looks like that generally speaking there hasnt been much movement in terms of rwa divergence and i was hoping you could speak to whether the impact from recent events has fully reflected in that number or whether we could see a further upward pressure in the fourth quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure yeah the youre speaking to the civil money penalty the answer is yes we have reflected our estimates of the impact in the rwa for operational risk associated with that and just given how it falls in terms of the level the magnitude of the impact relative to other operational risk there was not a material change in the rwa as a result of it steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it okay and then just one followup mark relating to discussion about profitability targets and the need to and the desire to close the gap with peers and thats still your intent this year youve planned to do an investor day it was delayed due to well covid then the consent order and a ceo transition does the management team intend to provide refresh targets in the coming months and are there any plans to actually hold an investor day so you could provide a more fulsome update i know its challenging to answer without jane on the call but i was hoping to get some perspective as to how we should think about the timing for when we can get at least some updated targets to hold the management team accountable to mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah no again thats a as you said thats a tough question to answer i would like to give obviously jane the opportunity to get in the seat and to work through some of the things that mike has referenced and ive referenced earlier obviously in the fourth quarter at least historically in the fourth quarter weve tried to give some context not only for full year performance but in terms of what were seeing in the market going forward well see how this fourth quarter plays out and obviously on the fourth quarter earnings call well give an updated perspective on what we think performance might look like in and also the timing for which we can give you a more comprehensive view on how we think about things going forward operator your next question is from the line of saul martinez with ubs citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey saul michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so im sorry im going to beat a dead horse even more here with the consent order and indiscernible potential applications on costs but i know its hard to know what the time horizon is around this in terms of having more color and its clear youre taking a you want to take this serious and youre not going to skin but these processes can be expensive and as you know you do have to improve outcomes in the short term and that has expenses ph but build more systematic solutions to operational risk efficiencies which require longer term investments and whatnot so with all of that how i mean when do you think you will know what youre up against and when i say what youre up against i mean meaning the not only the incremental expenses and im not just talking about but just in absolute terms how much youre going to have to spend to fix these issues and the time horizon to fix these issues when do you think youll have better handle on the multitude of different dimensions to this mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so let me try and go at this again so look we have we spend call it billion billion a year in terms of total expenses youve heard me reference about billion of that is associated with technology and maybe half of whatever is associated with kind of compensation but id highlight that to say that we obviously have a large expense base one that weve been managing very diligently over the past number of years and with that expense base there are a couple of different areas that i think are useful to point out as we think about the incremental need so one is the billionplus in incremental spend that weve made and as i mentioned earlier the opportunity to respend those dollars to reprioritize those dollars theres also a spend that we make on the current operations and infrastructure that we make every year and that too i think will give us an opportunity to relook at that spend that base and reprioritize that spend right so there are multiple categories where we can repoint if you will to a better approach if you will of addressing whats been highlighted in the order and its not until we kind of work through the incremental thats already in there the base that rolls off and gives us an opportunity to respend that we then are faced with okay what more is required around the investment now a couple of percentage points of an increase is pretty significant in the way of absolute dollars that can be put to work on these types of initiatives in terms of the when well let me ph get one of them and then the second thing id highlight is as mike pointed out separate and away from the required spend to address the opportunity or the investment in infrastructure risk and controls there also remains opportunities for us to look citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 at our data centers for us to to look at that where we have to ensure the right placement of people around the organization so our footprint for us to look at some of the rolloff from some of the covid spend that weve had to make this year so there are other opportunities for us to look at dollars that we have let alone capacity adjustments that may be warranted coming out of this covid19 and so what im trying to highlight is that there are many puts and takes through the budget process that were constructing now and the process that we will use to dimension the spend associated with this order in terms of timing the order actually points out that weve got some days or so to identify the gap a gap between our current state and an end state target and then some days or so to develop and have a plan approved after which we can move towards executing or continuing to execute against and so that gives you some sense for how were thinking about the timing and the dimensioning of this but again i think weve got a track record now as has been pointed out of being very thoughtful and responsible around investment dollars and our total expense base and you and others and shareholders should expect that we will continue to be disciplined and responsible as it relates to that and again as i mentioned earlier were looking to improve profitability and returns as we do this right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay no thats helpful and hopefully youll be able to succeed on that latter point just a quick followup and a little bit more of a mundane question i think just more of a correction or a clarification i think you mentioned mark in the fourth quarter that corporate and other pretax losses should be similar to this quarter did i get that right because you obviously had the civil fee in that in this indiscernible mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc quarter so ph can you sort of explain that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its kind of ex of sure so ex the million saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so i said roughly the million that we see excluding the million civil money penalty is likely to be the levels that we see in the fourth quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning mark if i could go to a different topic you mentioned that you dont really expect ncos to start peaking until the end of next year i was just wondering if thats just a time shift difference and can you just kind of walk us through how youre expecting the loss curve generally to appear over the next year or so thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so again its when you look across the portfolio were seeing payment rates coming in higher than we expected and consumers are proving to be quite resilient when you think about the stimulus and the forbearance programs that have been in place and so as we look at loss curves and delinquency buckets and what theyre suggesting over the next number of quarters it looks as though at the aggregate level were likely to see losses towards the fourth quarter or backend of obviously assumptions around gdp assumptions around unemployment all of those factors come into play but that is in fact what were seeing thats going to vary by regions and so in asia in latam we may see that earlier but what i was referencing in the back end was kind of when you look at the aggregate portfolio ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and if i could follow up on a question on just taxes obviously when taxes went down you guys had to write down the dta and just in terms of the outlook at least from what we know about a potential rise to depending on the outcome of the election and the eventual plans any ideas of what type of impact a directional change might have to the others to the positive in terms of either tax rate and being able to write back up the dta mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so hard to know exactly what happens but in the event that we did see or we do see a tax rate increase to or so and it went into effect in the latter part of it would likely result in our dta increasing by about billion so a onetime increase in our dta of about billion it obviously would have the impact of our rate being close to that level our tax rate being close to that level and as a result of that less income given the higher tax rate less income contributing to the cet1 ratio and then in terms of the disallowed dta with a higher corporate tax rate we would expect to return to our usage levels of roughly billion per year so that gives you a little bit of a sense of a couple of the moving pieces should that happen michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and mark i think an important nuance there is what comes out between remaining territorial or a reversion to global taxation i think what people are talking about today is it would likely remain territorial which again with average global tax rate of about that would certainly benefit us in some of the jurisdictions that we operate in citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thats a good point yeah operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks can i just ask one quick question first on the nii i heard you saying that its going to be stabilizing after the fourth quarter as you look out to but can you kind of just outline some of the factors that are leading to that stability i mean what gives you confidence that ph its actually be stable off that level did you think about the potential for stimulus and maybe further consumer deleveraging if we get stimulus in that statement thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and so look again that is based on kind of current trends that were seeing in terms of roughly improving unemployment and improving gdp obviously there is talk of another stimulus in terms of its impact weve assumed that kind of a bit later in terms of in the first quarter of it does assume that we continue to see the purchase sales activity improve quarteroverquarter weve seen some of that certainly in  we continue to see that as we look even in the early days of october and so that playing out would be another important factor and then obviously what happens in terms of the overall liquidity thats in the market is a factor that influences mix and the nim as well brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so maybe just second question on the nim i mean if you think about the yields on the earning asset side i mean are you getting closer to the trough yields as you think about the repricing cycle and where rates are they stabilized at a low level so are you kind of expecting earning asset yields to be closer to a bottom as well thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look in terms of the nim weve seen some of the obviously the pressure from rates weve seen the pressure in terms of the market in terms of the mix of assets that we have but also pressure in terms of the deposit levels coming in quite high with frankly a lack of loan demand to put that to work and so subject to how that liquidity thats in the market evolves and what happens with ultimate asset pricing is going to have an important factor on that the nim is really an output of how those nir revenues play out and how the balance sheet evolves and so a bit of continued uncertainty a little bit in terms of how some of those market factors play out but we see that as well stabilizing towards the end of the year operator your next question is from the line of jeff harte with piper sandler citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys unfortunately i have one more consent order kind of related question do you have a feel for regulators views on the adequacy of existing remediation projects that have been underway versus just not having moved fast enough michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure so i would say that not have moved fast enough and not have been holistic enough jeff to use my words and so again i think this gap analysis will give us a better sense of that but again as i said weve brought others in to help us look at and think about these things and so again well see what the final analysis yields but i think weve got a sense of the right approach and direction jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co not necessarily youre starting over michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i dont broadly define no there may be some more refined areas where it may make sense to do that but not broadly and again i think if you look at kind of how as an example weve kind of managed through this crisis which i think is a good real life live test again i think weve been able to get the data weve been able to make the right decisions weve been able to act in a timely manner but again i think this pandemic has shown us the accelerated move to digital and the ability to continue to work remotely or more remotely over time and the ability to make faster and better decisions is critical and in particular as i think appropriately our regulators continue to raise the bar on the larger institutions in terms of their expectations jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay and just kind of something fundamental mexico is a relatively large exposure for citigroup and a geography upon which the market has some macroeconomic concerns can you talk a bit about the creditrelated trends youre specifically seeing down in the business in mexico and kind of maybe what your expectations are or how much things like deferrals have helped down there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so i mean look mexico similar to other parts of the world also had forbearance as part of the program although unlike the us in mexico customers needed to be less than days past due as of the end of february to be eligible and so what we saw is that when you look at our loss rates for the quarter you see a tickup in latin america largely driven by mexico and the impact of those customers kind of playing through the delinquency buckets and into losses that said mexico also comes with a higher nim in the way of overall performance and we would expect for losses there to certainly come to a peak sooner than the end of citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 in terms of more broadly our exposure in mexico is about billion in terms of total country exposure and thats down a little bit since the second quarter at the end of the third quarter about billion of loans between gcb and icg in mexico billion are consumer loans about billion are corporate loans and about half of that billion a little bit more than half is in credit card and personal loans and remember we tend to target a higherquality customer segment than most of our peers there and we price the risk accordingly and so we would expect for that to play out in a relatively favorable way and then theres another of our payroll loans in the portfolio are concentrated in sectors that have a lower risk of layoffs like government employers and pensioners and so that too should be helpful as we think about the quality of our book and then theres the portion thats in mortgages is it weights towards ltvs of a or less than and so that too should speaks to the quality of our book so overall we feel as though were appropriately reserved and are managing reasonable levels of performance there operator your next question is from the line of ph charles peabody with portales q yeah i just had some followup questions on net interest revenue guidance you kept using the word stabilization as we enter so my first question is does that imply further weakness in the fourth quarter before it stabilizes and then the related question on page you show the mix of net interest revenue between the core bank and then the markets related and you saw a big drop in the marketsrelated net interest revenue and i was wondering if you can talk about what drove that and is which of those pieces do you expect to stabilize first mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and so just to be clear the stabilization that i was referring to is kind of as we go into the fourth quarter and so id expect net interest revenue to stabilize in the fourth quarter for total citi and for many of the factors that i mentioned already look the markets revenue as youve heard me mention before its really important to look at total revenue the total revenue there in part because the nature of how transactions are structured with clients impacts whether that revenue is coming in the form of nir and nonnir and so i think its very important to as i mentioned look at total revenue there and our total revenue in the quarter as i mentioned earlier is up in terms of in total markets revenue in light of the strong fixed income and the strong equities performance that we saw there and so that part is lower than the prior quarter as we see some of that normalization in markets take place but still very strong in light of the environment that were managing through and candidly as we go into a fourth quarter with an election and in the case of europe brexit and speculation around the stimulus and uncertainty around vaccines hard to predict exactly how customers clients decide to reposition their books as some of those things become clearer and so total revenue in the way of markets revenue is the way we think about it and a fourth quarter that i think will show nir revenue stabilizing but keep in mind markets performance will likely have puts and takes citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 q and my followup question let me just ask that same question about mix between marketsrelated nii and core bank would you expect the core bank nii to actually grow in the fourth quarter sequentially mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well again i would expect that our fourth quarter will show net interest revenues and nonnet interest revenues kind of down yearoveryear but the aggregate of the two relatively stable operator your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning mike on the whole regulatory issue its quite disappointing to read in the consent orders that the incentive comp did not account for risk management and the comments about the practices that the regulators made given that what changes should we expect in senior management incentive comp and can you talk about why you didnt prioritize risk management which is such a cornerstone since the last crisis and what changes should we expect in the board as well as other senior executives as a result michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so the notion of accountability and i think what theyre speaking to goes more broad than just the executive management team but obviously youve got a number of work streams here youve got a fair number of people involved in those processes and its kind of taking it down and kind of making sure that the people who are responsible for each of those processes have the appropriate weighting and i think the challenge comes that in many of the instances or in many of the work streams you actually have people that it isnt their sole job they are a practicing expert or a practicing practitioner in terms of the markets business or in consumer or in different functions and we have ph seconded them as part of their job into doing this regulatory work because theyre the expert theyre the area through which a number of these things would flow and the question is how do you create the proper balance and proper accountability around that so i dont look at it and say that its just the executive team i think its striking the right balance and so as an example should someone in risk be responsible for delivering on financials of the firm profitability expenses or other pieces that are in there and so i think its kind of creating the right balance to drive the right behaviors get the right citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 outcomes and incent in people in both directions properly so again i think that its the way its written its my interpretation is its actually broader than the way youve described it vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and so does that mean youll be adding more people do you think as a result to be able to hold some people fully responsible for this or how are you thinking as you look forward michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well we have in risk and controls weve been weve added thousands of people since the beginning of the year and we were adding people last year to these projects so without a doubt weve been bringing those resources and getting that expertise in and weve tried to bring in subject matter experts from other firms from other industries to help us as we think about these things and i think weve made a number of very key strong external hires i think weve made some very strong internal moves in terms of people and i think weve also moved strongly in terms of what i would say single ph hatting people ie making this remediation not just their primary but in many case their sole responsibility in terms of delivering on so again yes were absolutely committed to having the right resources the right expertise the right talent and then having the right accountability around delivering against this mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and mike you may have mentioned but karen peetz obviously we brought in as the cao and to help kind of lead in this transformation across the organization so as you say were bringing in the people that we need and getting after it operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so like you just mentioned karen was brought in in june and mike i know you became ceo of the citibank usa like legal entity back in june timeframe so i guess im kind of looking at all this thinking you must have expected youve been working on this for a while and i was thinking that you probably expected some kind citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 of requirement from the regulators that you were already partially executing on is that fair like is this consent order might be a surprise to the street but is it really a surprise to you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well around these work streams as weve acknowledged we have been working on them for a while so its not like all of a sudden we woke up one day and said gee were going to go at some of these things as de novo or new projects so weve been working on them for a while and i would say that again what weve been focused on is really bringing these projects together i would say a historic approach that weve taken is weve gone at these in some ways serially or individually and i dont think that has yielded the outcomes that either i either citi or our regulators necessarily would want and so as we went down this path it became apparent to me and i think the board and others that we needed to really join these processes and create a body to be able to go at it and i think were very fortunate to have karen with us who has been through some of this and have this expertise to be able to i think bring these work streams together because when you think about data as an example data feeds through risk data feeds through compliance data feeds through lots of your controls and making sure that were taking a holistic approach to the way that we go at and modernize our data approach is critical such that we do it once we do it right we do it holistically and so again i dont think the work or some of the work streams are new i think the broader more encompassing holistic approach in some areas is newer mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and mike just to that point in terms of us having started this already again the incremental billion were spending were not we started spending that at the beginning of the year right and we spent incremental dollars in as well and by the way that billion wasnt something that i capped it was what do we think is required to make as much traction as we can in the year and were spending that incremental billion and still managing our total expenses responsibly right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah its interesting point because when i look at the stock im looking at a stock thats priced for effectively a roe okay and if you say hey that is right because the expenses are going to go up that much to drive a roe thats like a billion increase in expenses and mark to your point earlier you were mentioning that youre planning on or hoping to execute this improving profitability which is obviously above today so could you help us understand what kinds of profit improvements you think you can focus on over the course of the next couple of years i mean im wondering what some big threads are is it better deposit core deposits that can bring down your cost of funds is it greater execution with your current customer base is it incremental customers i mean help us understand what youre thinking about there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look there are going to be multiple components to it right there are additional linkages that we try to capture across our franchises whether its doing more with our tts clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 ive mentioned earlier that we are seeing a lot of traction as it relates to instant payment capabilities whether its doing more between our capital markets business in spread products and trade lending that we do with corporate clients in terms of unique structuring opportunities there and so there are linkage opportunities across the franchise that we will continue to capture that i think will help in the way of top line performance there are opportunities to grow in the wealth management space weve seen growth in investments in asia this quarter we think theres more upside we think theres more wealth growth upside in the us as well but there are also operational benefits from again when we say manual activity when you replace manual activity with an improved technology or an automation or straightthrough processing you remove the manual removing the manual improves the quality of the output in a more timely fashion but it also over time is less costly when you dont have those manual steps and so id say improved profitability as we go into and and beyond in part in getting both top line ultimately getting expense benefits from a host of activities including capacity adjustments that we may decide to take as we come out of this crisis and then the other items play through as well including cost of credit and so on and so forth operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning mark good morning indiscernible mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark youve given us some good detail on the consumer portfolios can you share with us on the commercial side when you look at your ratings that you give us in terms of investment grade to bb b ccc they really havent moved very much since the fourth quarter of so can you share with us what youre seeing in these portfolios and are the energy portfolios and the leisure and hospitality travel portfolios still the ones that give you the most risk or you see the most risk in terms of credit losses over the next months or so mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure gerard let me start by saying as you know we have coming out of the last crisis we have really adjusted our risk framework our risk appetite we have rethought our client focus to ensure that were focused on citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 clients that can take best advantage of the breadth of our offering but also on the multinational investmentgrade type clients and so we have maintained a skew in terms of ratings towards or so of our portfolio being in those investmentgrade names weve got a long history of operating in all of these sectors that you see on page and weve got deep experience through cycles and expertise in each of these industries and that includes client selection and in many instances we are banking many of the leaders in their respective industries and its important to note that because i think that speaks to not only the quality of the name but what we can expect when you go through downturns and it speaks to why were so committed to staying alongside our clients and helping them manage through the uncertainty when i think about some of the sectors that we point to in this crisis weve been thoughtful about the way we have dealt with these clients over time so you look at the aviation space and our exposures there tend to be secured they tend to we have extensive experience with structuring to mitigate risk there whether thats secured or guaranteed by export credit agencies weve got extensive experience with valuation of collateral there if you look at autos in many cases the lending there is in securitization vehicles so the risk of bankruptcy is remote and with underlying consumer obligors in that case you look at energy and a lot of that is reservebased lending with borrowing bases that go through a periodic redetermination and that helps in terms of reducing exposure when oil prices fall and so you look at these you look at our activity with these clients in these sectors our deep experience and we think that it positions us well to manage through this with them and certainly feel good about the reserves that we have and we have taken proactive actions in the precrisis we went through exposure reductions just given where we were in the cycle and weve aggressively downgraded names that are in impacted sectors early in the crisis and put enhanced monitoring in place but as i mentioned we feel good about the portfolio we have we feel good about the reserves that we have and we feel good about our ability to manage through this with these clients operator i would now turn
