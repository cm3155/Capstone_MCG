joined this morning by our chief financial officer mark mason and our treasurer mike verdeschi in a moment mike will take you through the fixed income investor presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom afterwards mark and mike willing be happy to answer your questions before we get started id like to remind you that todays presentation may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 circumstances actual results in capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due take a variety of factors including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our sec filings including without limitation the risk factors section of our form 10k before i turn it over to mike to walk through the presentation id like to make a few comments about the frequency of the fixed income investor reviews going forward first i would say that we truly value the engagement of our fixed income investors both during the fixed income investor reviews and outside of the reviews and while we feel the investor review calls are a great opportunity for our investors to engage with us in a public forum at this point we believe hosting the call two times a year is most appropriate so going forward we would envision one call occurring after fourth quarter earnings and one call after second quarter earnings however we would of course host a call outside of this schedule if there are updates that we believe our investors would benefit from again we value the engagement and do not plan to be any less engaged with our investors though the nature and timing of that engagement will continue to evolve with that said let me turn it over to mike michael verdeschi treasurer citigroup inc thank you tom and good morning everyone on todays call i will cover a number of topics first ill briefly discuss our operating results second i will cover recent balance sheet trends third ill review our issuance programs and finally ill discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position slide summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year in we reported net income of billion even as we increased our reserves by roughly billion under the cecl framework on slide we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars on this basis we have grown our balance sheet by approximately over the last year as we continued to support our consumer and institutional clients as they manage through the covid19 health crisis while also maintaining a strong balance sheet in the fourth quarter deposits grew in line with recent trends with continued momentum in consumer and continued client engagement in our institutional business loans declined reflecting lower levels of consumer and corporate activity tradingrelated assets and liabilities grew reflecting a continuation of heightened client activity relative to the prior year and longterm debt increased year over year but decreased sequentially as we maintained our robust liquidity profile and optimized our funding given our strong deposit growth slide presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars total citigroup loans decreased year over year in our consumer franchise average loans declined year over year primarily reflecting the impact of lower consumer spending in our cards business and higher payments by customers given high levels of liquidity due to fiscal stimulus in our institutional franchise average loans decreased year over year breaking that down by business average loans in corporate lending decreased year over year reflecting net repayments as we continued to assist our clients in accessing the capital markets private bank loans increased largely driven by secured lending to our high net worth clients including residential real estate lending tts loans decreased reflecting softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level of spend in commercial cards and loans included in corpother continued to decline driven by the winddown of legacy assets citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 on slide we show credit quality trends in our gcb and icg loan portfolios in icg credit quality remained broadly stable in the fourth quarter nonaccrual loans declined sequentially to billion or basis points of total loans reflecting writeoffs and repayments across the portfolio in gcb credit trends remained broadly stable to improving this quarter given high levels of liquidity in the us lower spending and the benefits of relief programs while we do expect losses to begin to rise in given todays delinquency trends and the expected impact of recent stimulus we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out for the first half of with losses in asia and mexico peaking earlier than in the us that said with credit reserves of billion we believe we are well prepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolios turning to slide we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars total average deposits increased from the prioryear period reflecting continued client engagement as well as the elevated level of liquidity in the system now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide in we issued approximately billion of parentlevel benchmark debt across a variety of tenors including the issuance of our inaugural billion affordable housing bonds so far in we issued roughly billion going forward well continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currencies and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations as i just mentioned in we issued approximately billion of parent benchmark debt with billion of maturities looking to we expect gross issuance of roughly billion to billion and we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our funding through opportunistic redemptions on slide we show the composition of all longterm debt outstanding during the fourth quarter our total long term debt declined by approximately billion to billion as we allowed our bank debt to mature given strong deposit growth on slide we provide an update of our lcr metrics and drivers our average lcr was unchanged at this quarter turning to slide let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio increased to and our slrs were and for citigroup and citibank respectively moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points in we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise we earned over billion of net income even as we increased credit reserves by roughly billion we maintained a strong capital position with a cet1 capital ratio of basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement an slr of and a surplus above our tlac requirement and we also maintained a strong liquidity position with an average lcr of over billion of available liquidity resources and we expect to be in compliance with the nsfr net stable funding ratio when the rule is effective our capital and liquidity profile remains strong and well positioned to withstand potential pressure if economic conditions deteriorate and we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that deepen and expand our client relationships and support the broader recovery citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 before we move on to qa let me touch briefly on libor as many of you on this call are aware there have been some additional developments since the third quarter fixed income investor call subject to the results of the iba ice benchmark administration consultation it appears likely that most us dollar libor tenors will continue to be published through june at citi while we are continuing to work with our regulators and various industry working groups including the alternative reference rate committee to ensure our smooth and timely transition we do appreciate the flexibility this affords with regard to the subset of our preferreds which we have mentioned on previous calls while we are continuing to evaluate alternatives we dont have any further updates at this time and with that mark and i will be happy to answer your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of hima inguva with bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc great good morning and happy new year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc good morning hima hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for hosting the call mark good morning again mark mike and tom i really appreciate the disclosures and the opportunity to have the dialogue im going to start off with slr so when we are thinking about slr and how moving from a backstop to being a binding measure would that impact the way you think about capital returns and then in line with what your peers have commented on just maybe if you could give us some color on if you see retaining more equity or maybe issuing more debt or prefs and also if you could please suggest if tlac would be more binding that slr in that case so if you could kind of help us parse it out that would be great michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure hima thanks for the question certainly an area of focus given slr and tlac exemption for reserves and treasuries are set to expire at the end of the short answer is that slr would not become binding for us and so will not impact our capital return or even the prefs at this time citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 for slr the exemption is worth roughly basis points so all things equal that slr would come down to so still basis points above our regulatory minimum and we are assuming continued growth of the balance sheet driven by deposits but that basis points of room gives us an opportunity to continue to grow in terms of tlac again with the exemption ending at a binding constraint would flip from rwa to leverage and in leverage as of we have a tlac surplus of billion so that exemption is worth roughly billion so if it does expire that surplus comes down from billion down to billion which is still above our billion to billion targeted range so our issuance plans do assume that exemption ends at and the issuance plans also consider the balance sheet growth that we expect to see in supporting our clients so the impact on tlac of course is something that well be focused on and hopefully that gives you a sense of the implications but taking a step back just a few other thoughts the fed appropriately reintroduced quantitative easing measures as covid unfolded early last year at that time the qe actions were meant to add liquidity to address the market dislocation at that time the fed of course has maintained qe as the markets have even stabilized and shifted that focus to using the accommodative stance to support employment and inflation goals the byproduct of these policy actions is that liquidity in the system has grown and will remain elevated so giving you some context the fed grew its balance sheet by about trillion in which drove industry deposit growth of about trillion or a little over so that kind of deposit growth has implications on leverage and those key measures such as slr and the gsib score as well so with monetary policy remaining accommodative the exemption of reserves and treasuries would still very much make sense given where so much of this liquidity is being deployed mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc mike id add one point to that which is i think one we feel good about the ability to continue to return capital so i would make that point and then two i think the fed has been as you described mike very thoughtful and constructive about providing this relief and i would hope that theyd give additional consideration around extending it or even making it permanent and also taking a look at the gsib score given the amount of liquidity impacts that score as well hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc great i appreciate it i also want to recognize all the efforts that youre doing in terms of diversity and inclusion and its very good to see all that in the news so i appreciate that with that im going to pass it on mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you hima michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc thanks hima mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i appreciate it citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 operator your next question is from the line of scott cavanagh with apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good morning guys thanks for the call before going to the questions i just wanted on your announcement about moving to two calls per year i would say that we very much appreciate your industryleading outreach with fixed income investors particularly these quarterly updates and presentations and i would encourage the continuation or at least keeping up the overall high level of engagement because i think it pays benefits even with current spread levels being so tight going on to questions perhaps we can dive into looking at the overall health of the consumer particularly in the credit card portfolio could you give us your expectations for net chargeoffs on both the retail and branded card portfolios for and and then could you dovetail that into what are you seeing as far as differentiation across the fico bands in these portfolios im really trying to get at is there a differentiation between higher scores and lower scores and given the expected runoff of a lot of the covid relief efforts and the pending eventual having to pay rent again for some people and then having to pay student loans again is there kind of a risk for a cliff effect there and impact on net chargeoffs mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you scott why dont i take that first of all i would say that we very much value the engagement with you all as investors as well and so we look forward to continuing that secondly with regard to the consumer its interesting the consumer again has proven to be incredibly resilient through this and obviously the stimulus thats been provided has been helping to bridge consumers in a substantive way when we look at the performance that weve seen through the fourth quarter we continue to see payment rates run at a very good level we saw a pickup in purchase sale activity or certainly not down nearly as much as it was earlier in the year and thats really across both portfolios both the branded cards as well as the retail services portfolio so not a lot of distinction between the two in terms of that positive activity as you would have seen in some of the cost of credit information weve also seen delinquencies remain quite low in the portfolio and its really the signs that were seeing there of consumers continued ability to pay and lower delinquencies that lead us to believe that were more likely to see losses peak no longer in but more likely in just speaking more broadly around the portfolio thats going to vary depending on region but for the us portfolio thats been pushed out more likely to now the reality is that there is continued talk of an additional stimulus and to the extent that additional stimulus are put out there that is likely to have a continued impact the good news with the additional stimulus assuming similar behavior is that payments continue the downside to that is that puts pressure on loan volume and so netnet we think losses more likely in at this point additional stimulus could impact that and in fact additional stimulus could end up not only delaying peak losses but also deflating peak losses and so we kind of have to see how some of that plays out but thus far we feel very good about what were seeing and in fact continue to look at these behaviors for signs for when we should enter or reenter the markets so to speak with marketing and programs that lead towards acquisition citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc thats very helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc ph at least for our card customers scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc thats very helpful on the funding side could you give us some guidance on what your expectations for potential additional green or social bond issuance and then where you stand on the investments for the recent affordable housing bond issuance michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure so scott its mike i think on that we were very happy with the two green bond issuance that weve done again starting in and then following up with the dollarbased green bond in of course we wanted to expand beyond that and so we introduced the affordable housing bond last year and so we do very much want to remain active in this space of esg and so well look at other structures well look at the potential to come back and tie the green bonds or for another social as well so this is very much something that will be a focus of ours of course when we look at this issuance we look at this issuance in the context of the broader needs obviously were going to be taking legal entities into account tenor into account investor demand but it is something that we want to continue to stay active in and so with the housing bond of course the proceeds for the transaction finances construction rehabilitation or preservation of quality affordable housing for low and moderate income populations in the us so thats where the proceeds are used and of course as i mentioned we want to remain active in the space of issuance operator your next question is from the line of gary kessler with goldman sachs gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi thanks thanks for taking my question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc i appreciate the call as always good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi gary gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc i just wanted to touch on the press again so you guys have not libor i think we all bought ourselves a little bit of time there but more on some of the decisionmaking and it was helpful to get the conversation on the slr thinking about the december ccar and the redeemwithoutreplace option and it looks like with what you did issuancewise in december and what youre calling out it looks like maybe youll go a little bit below and sort of whats the target there in light of the cet1 cushion as well as other constraints and when you think about the refinancing decision when you look at the two callable pieces of paper that you have left on the institutional side those are both economically could be refinanced and so should we be thinking about purely about the reset and when you think about replacing potentially refi and different structures do you think more when you think about say a noncall 5year versus a noncall 10year do you care more about coupon optionality the back end how should we be thinking about these things michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure thanks for the question in the past weve talked about a target of roughly basis points and so where we end the quarter were probably more like basis points so that range that target of basis points is still something that we do think about and as you point out obviously we issued late last year and use that as an opportunity to call structures that was an economic decision and as we look at our structures as weve talked about in the past as they become callable well continue to first look at the need for maintaining that capital outstanding and if so well look at the economics associated with leaving that structure outstanding versus calling it and replacing it with a new structure in terms of the structure itself as you said the tenor of that call or even the back end setting that we embed its really going to be a function of where that investor demand is so we want to keep a good dialogue and understand where there may be preferences of course youve seen so far in the past as part of that transition away from libor but more recently cmt and again thats a function of where perhaps some of the preferences are obviously with rates very low and some steepness in that yield curve that that fiveyear cmt seemed to make sense so youre likely to see us continue with that same practice of that targeted range of basis points the evaluation of the economics as well as other factors and then in terms of structure were going to continue to maintain that good dialogue with the investors on what may be preferable gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats helpful thank you michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 operator your next question is from the line of brian monteleone with barclays brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi brian brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc so it was positive development in new york about moving forward with a libor solution via the legislative route i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about specifically in new york if that becomes law fixing that kind of fallback language where specifically that helps and then maybe what other parts of your capital structure might need something in delaware something similar in delaware like i think some of the preferreds are covered by delaware law michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure brian its mike in terms of that legislation i think ive said this in the past the libor transition its certainly a complex transition and the recognition of coming up with some legislative solutions we think is a very positive development and you talked about new york and the press would be more applicable to delaware but i would say just getting started on a framework for legislation in terms of how that would apply what is the scope of it i think is a positive development certainly could you see states following once there is a precedent and a framework the other thing i would point out too is there more is there a development in the federal space as well around legislation so i think this is the types of developments that are encouraging and new york on its own may not solve some of the things that were focused on on its own we still think its a positive development as well as that potential for legislation the federal legislation as well brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc thanks and then maybe a question for mark any thoughts you can give us around the timing of the review that you and jane are going through around all the different businesses and how you think about investment et cetera going forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 sure brian you came across a little bit muffled but i think you were asking about the timing in terms of the strategy for me and jane is that right did i get that right brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc correct correct yes mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so look you obviously heard jane on the earnings call she takes the seat end of february first of march and so certainly want to give her time to get squarely in the ceo seat and as she mentioned were spending time now and well spend some period of time thereafter to really try and do a thorough kind of review what i would say though is that in some ways you can look at some of the announcements that we put out already and see that were not waiting for when things make sense so we recently announced the creation of a new wealth management unit which really brings together our private bank and our consumer wealth organization which includes the international personal bank and the citi personal wealth management business it brings all of that together and really moves to create a single integrated platform to serve our clients clients everywhere from the affluent level straight up to the ultrahigh net worth client and i simply highlight that to say that while were working on taking a look at the strategy as jane suggested were not waiting where things make sense to kind of get off the ground and so stay tuned well continue to work through it and its obviously an imperative for the entire leadership team with jane driving it operator your next question is from the line of arnold kakuda with bloomberg intelligence arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg intelligence hey mark mike and tom i appreciate the call its always very helpful so compared to peers your cet1 target seems very conservative its basis points above your requirement and that compares with peers that are maybe looking at a to basis point excess target so youve done well on the past few stress tests you talked about this reevaluation process i think simplification was a word i heard so is there a chance to evaluate the cet1 target as well going forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so what id say is look were still as you know arnold were still kind of managing through a crisis with some uncertainty thats still out there and so as i sit here today i continue to feel good about the when we established that as you know we were looking and still had uncertainty around things like the stress capital buffer and how that would play out weve now seen that both at the from the initial submission and an increase of about basis points in the most recent although that stopped being applied theres still movement obviously with the gsib score that i referenced earlier which is at for us now but with the increase in deposits were currently running a bit higher than that and so i feel good about the and well continue to look at that as things continue to normalize but at this stage thats where we are citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 now i would remind you or continue to point out that we ended the fourth quarter at which obviously is above that target that we have and i think weve had a pretty good run rate leading into this crisis of being thoughtful about returning capital at a reasonable pace and well continue to do that particularly given that the fed has reinstated the ability to do that in  here and so were looking forward to that arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg intelligence great thanks for that and then shifting to deposits the classic teachings i guess are that deposits are good but in this low rate world where there is lots of liquidity and low loan demand have deposits become a burden in a sense or is there something is it just the stage of the cycle where demand is low for loans that you want to take on an extra i guess relationship so are deposits a burden right now mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i can start and then mike you may want to chime in what id say is we obviously talk to some of the deposit momentum or growth that weve seen across the franchise and i think there are probably a couple of lenses through which one can look at that one is it obviously is a lower cost of funding than some of the other alternatives that one would have two is i think if you look at the nature of the growth that weve had take for example the us consumer it really leverages or demonstrates the payoff if you will from the investments weve been making in our digital capability and helps to expand our customer footprint beyond just where we have branches and so thats good and as you know we look to use that to expand our wallet share with those customers and the third thing id point to is even as we look on the institutional side where weve had good deposit growth with our tts clients it really is and does create a foray to expand the nature of those relationships as well as theyve opened new digital accounts with us and expanded the dialogue to include conversation around their supply chain and things of that sort now the reality is also the other factor that comes into play here is what you suggested which is that there is low loan demand and that is something that we continue to watch and monitor and the deposits do put pressure on the gsib score and we just talked a little about the slr as well and so well have to continue to manage that and monitor that and hopefully we end up with relief as it relates to things like gsib but were approaching this from a relationship point of view and we think thats pretty important mike i dont know if you want to add anything to that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc no nothing to add mark operator your next question is from the line of robert smalley with ubs robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks a lot and good morning mark mike and tom citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc a lot of questions asked and answered so a couple of followups on scotts question on consumers given that youre seeing in the us problem credits peaking in the first half of next year will the allowance for loan loss reserves there just remain static for the rest of the year or could you see releasing some of those reserves as you get a better handle on that and maybe there are some cecl implications in there that you could talk about second question i had was on slide and it relates to your comments on rest of the world latin american days past dues picking up to is that what youre seeing and thats why youre saying that peak there will be in the second half of this year and then i had a question on the ib mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure why dont i start with your question with regard to consumer reserves and what could impact that going forward i guess there are a couple of things that factor into the reserving actions that we take and so one would certainly be changes in the portfolio and that is to say recovery in spend an increase in loan volumes or even customer behavior and mix those things will factor what happens with factor into what happens with the reserve levels the second is kind of the base scenario or even the two scenarios that we look at so the base scenario which will reflect the shape and the pace of recovery and to the extent that we continue to see improvements in that base scenario with the assumptions gdp unemployment et cetera that will have an impact on our estimate for the lifetime reserves in this case associated with the consumer portfolio the third would be how we look at the downside scenario and obviously to the extent that its more severe or a higher probability of a downside or a lower probability of a downside that will factor into how we think about that euma that management adjustment that weve talked about before and then losses obviously play in as well as we see those losses materialize all things being equal wed be releasing reserves so there are a number of factors that will come into play as we see reserves move around in the coming quarters what i would say or the final point id make on this is that even as we sit here now relative to the assumptions we had for many of those variables when we ended the year many of them have moved in a positive direction have improved and so not to repeat it all again but that becomes a factor that shape and pace of a recovery is factored in there and as i said on the earnings call i do expect that well see improved profitability in and were more likely to see releases in terms of and your second question was with regard to latin america and what id say here is and im looking at kind of the trend that we saw in both ncls as well as delinquencies and in the earnings deck we showed that delinquencies were coming down in the fourth quarter and that our im sorry that losses were coming down in the fourth quarter excuse me and that delinquencies were picking up a bit and what id highlight there is the difference between customers that are on the relief program and coming off versus customers that were never on that relief program and so what were seeing in the delinquencies that are on that chart reflects the fact that customers coming off the relief program are starting to flow through those delinquency buckets what citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 were seeing in the lower net credit losses represents favorable performance from customers that were not on the relief program so hopefully that gives you a little bit of that dynamic but to answer your question more specifically it is that trend in delinquencies that give us a view that we are likely to see losses for latin america in this example peak in the first half of operator your next question is from the line of nikhil khosla with jpmorgan nikhil khosla q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning and thank you for hosting the call two things one a followup on brians question on the preferred side given that there is a legislative solution out there and to your point if it extends to delaware and theres a federal angle to it if that were to happen would it preclude the exchange or consent path that youve been talking about on previous calls so if there is a legislative solution would you not go down the exchange and consent because you can essentially you have a fallback language through a legislative growth path michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc we would have to see of course what that solution would entail its a good question because i think when you think about the complexity of the transition when you have things like preferreds you would put that in the category of some of these structures certainly that remain fixed or even ones that are a float that would essentially convert to fixed those are the types of things that are complicated and so i do think legislation is one of those areas that could provide a solution but i do think its going to be a consideration for whats included in that legislation weve talked about an amendment weve talked about an exchange we will continue to evaluate the various alternatives to make sure were ready to deal with any of those options when the timing is right nikhil khosla q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you for that and a followup to the peak losses and to your guidance around peak losses in the us now in the first half of next year how should we think about delinquencies trending there and when should delinquencies very similar to what were seeing in latin america now where people coming out of relief programs are flowing into the higher delinquency buckets when will that happen in the us given the tdr relief i believe has been extended until the end of so just trying to kind of triangulate are you using that tdr relief of people coming off forbearance now flowing into delinquency buckets or when should we see that happening in the us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so i guess id make a couple points one id like to correct i think i may have said that peak losses in mexico would be in the second half i meant that they would peak in the first half of so i just wanted to correct myself on that in terms of kind of us peak losses again there are a number of factors that come into play there including kind of how the stimulus continues to evolve and how much more stimulus is introduced and so while that is the current timing and the view that stimulus response as well as the behavior from consumers will be a major factor as to what peak levels look like and the timing of them so i mentioned earlier the idea of delaying or deflating citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 in terms of tdrs which i think was the other part of your question we really dont expect to see a material impact we had limited usage of this relief kind of outside of the programs and to some extent even within the programs the usage has been limited so again i would say that any relief really didnt have a significant impact on many of the important factors and variables and i dont think that that will have a material impact kind of playing into losses in operator your next question is from the line of mark kehoe with mackay shields mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc good morning just two quick questions it sounds like there are some new york tech ph exception firms looking toward their banks for more additional lending to avoid a kind of final round of equity financing before the ipo or do a spac can you just talk about how you manage the credit risk of lending to those firms particularly if they need to be on the ipo docket thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc im sorry would you i had a hard time hearing your question would you mind repeating it mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc yes sure sorry it sounds like some of the new york tech firms are looking towards their banks for additional lending so as to avoid a final round of equity funding before ipoing or going to a spac structure im just wondering how you are managing the credit risk of potentially lending to those firms in a debt capacity but also needs to be on the ipo mandate mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure yes so again and i think you know this about our kind of risk framework and how we think about our credit profile we tend to focus predominantly on our large multinational clients that are predominantly investment grade which stick to kind of sectors that or clients that are strongest in their sectors and that we have longstanding relationships with that said we have been very active from an investment banking point of view in the spac space and certainly have seen that play out in our equity capital markets performance through the year as it relates to credit risk related to that we obviously have a robust framework and infrastructure around that and we set credit limits across different risk parameters for clients and this would not be any exception to that in terms of not only monitoring the profile of those clients but making sure that were operating inside of limits that make sense for the type of exposure that we want to take on mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc okay thank you and just my second question it sounds like youre kind of waiting for a lot of external factors around the gsib buffer and the slr but is there any further optimization both on the asset and liability side of your balance sheet that you can do just given the elevated deposit trends that are likely to exist for the near future citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sorry mark are you asking what other things can we do on balance sheet sort of in the deployment of those deposits mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc yes or even kind of around the asset side as well michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure as we look at the balance sheet and we think about that deposit growth last year obviously you did see a surge in that lending activity as there were client draws but given the amount of liquidity in the system we saw those loans repaid as we were supporting clients who accessed the markets at that time when we think about this year that liquidity in the system remains so thats still very much dynamic and when you think about what we could do on balance sheet maybe just starting on the liability side that deposit growth does give us an opportunity to reduce some of the wholesale funding that we would have had and what i mean by that in particular things like fhlb so we can reduce that short term long term that makes room for us to take in those deposits and support our clients of course well always be looking at the callable structures as well and whether we do need that liquidity or whether we should call it so theres always going to be a set of liability optimization that well be thinking about on the asset side of course ill mention lending in a minute but even in the investment portfolio over the past year we grew that investment portfolio close to billion and the vast majority of that went into us treasuries but we also invested in nondollar sovereigns and agency mbs as well so that will be something that we continue to evaluate and deploy investments to certainly as weve seen some steepening of the yield curve and 10year rates popping above that we are looking at and of course if that yield curve continues to steepen which we think it could that will continue to provide an opportunity there and of course well be evaluating how that lending activity evolves over the course of the year but that would be of course the more traditional deployment of those deposits but the combination of looking at managing the liability side as well as deployment into securities those are all things that we will be looking at to optimize mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think thats right mike were going to actively manage all of this we cant forget that the increased liquidity that weve seen on the heels of some of the fed monetary actions are a byproduct of this covid19 pandemic crisis that were managing through and that were not entirely through yet and so were going to continue to look at the balance sheet both liabilities as well as assets and try to manage that actively with client focus in mind and certainly keeping in mind the capital implications but what we really need to do is ensure that we get through all of this and get back to some level of normalcy as it relates to all of these things operator your next question is from the line of kevin maloney with blackrock citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc thanks guys as the loss curve keeps getting pushed out ph and cards to and spend is recovering how are you thinking about the card portfolio are you increasing marketing spend maybe to get transactors or are you changing any credit adjustments or are you just trying to stay cautious mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look its the right question and when i think back to the last crisis we learned that that timing is critically important the timing for which you put mitigating risk management in place as well as the timing for which you decide to reenter the market weve taken several actions while continuing to serve clients including pausing certain marketing programs and balance consolidation offers pausing proactive credit limit increases and reducing the size of introductory lines weve tightened the parameters around some of the digital lending activity that weve done weve tightened parameters around some of our customers and so weve done a whole host of things in order to ensure that weve been managing the risk through this environment those actions obviously have an impact on interestbearing balance growth and therefore on revenues so its going to be important for us to reenter the market with client offers given or when the environment kind of supports that and to that end we have been testing target market reentry thats included sequential increases in advertising quarteroverquarter and marketing spend in the fourth quarter in asia in markets where the pandemic is more controlled weve initiated kind of the unwind of some of our credit tightening action and were looking to ensure that we can take advantage of the turn in customer interest when that starts to play out in the us and mexico expansion frankly has been a little bit more limited todate and over time we will again look for the right timing to leg in more meaningfully kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc great answer thank you lastly a number of fintechs and nonbank financials have entered the consumer lending space including i guess buynowpaylater guys is that a competitive threat to the card market or is it too small to even think about mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc im sorry i just couldnt make out the connection here is bad i couldnt make out kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc sure a number of nonbank and fintech financials entered the consumer lending space including buynowpay later concepts is that a threat to the card market or is it just too small think about at this point mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look we dont take any of kind of the new fintech strategies for granted but what i would say is that those are small efforts we do have i think a meaningful scale in our cards business and weve got i think a very good risk citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 29jan2021 framework for how we assess new and existing customers and manage our exposure in a fashion that allows for us to get returns that make good sense and so on top of that our strategy involves how we expand the offering that we have with these clients and how we serve them with enhanced digital capabilities and i think the combination of continuing to evolve our solutions new channels for accessing clients like our google relationship as well as enhanced servicing play to ensure that we kind of continue to capture growth when the market kind of stabilizes and well watch many of those other players entering the market but in the meantime were staying engaged with our customer base here operator your final question is from the line of ryan butkus with lord abbett ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett co llc hi thanks for hosting the call again just a followon from marks earlier question on slide as it relates to the highquality liquid assets so year over year this is up available cash is at versus a year ago and you have things like level assets at versus a year ago now so i was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the pace and the categories that you could potentially consider redeploying some of the available cash obviously theres an element of conservatism here just given the background that youre operating in but i think its just an interesting market dynamic to consider michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc its mike i do think you raise a good point so we do have ample space in that level as i talked about over the past year we really did deploy to i would say the vast majority of that portfolio that we hold which is going to be highly liquid product over time we do typically look at spread products as well we have deployed the spread products in the past given the amount of surplus liquidity in the system today spreads have come in so we do want to look at all the asset classes and evaluate the opportunity but we are if were going to deploy to less liquid we are going to look at the returns on capital as well so we want to be focused on the economics too so i didnt mean to rule out that we would look at those categories but again its a portfolio that were going to maintain good liquidity in and so the vast majority would continue to be into those more liquid products such as treasuries agency mortgages but at the right time we will look to continue to expand spread products as those opportunities arise ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett co llc thank you operator this concludes the questionandanswer session mr rogers do you have any closing remarks thomas rogers headfixed income
