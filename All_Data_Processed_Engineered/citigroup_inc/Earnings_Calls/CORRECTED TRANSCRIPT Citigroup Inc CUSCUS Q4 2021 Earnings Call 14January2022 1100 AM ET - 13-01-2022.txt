happy new year everyone i am delighted to join you again today well weve been busy and we have a lot to talk about today im going to start with an update on our strategy refresh then ill share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that weve made against our major priorities as you saw earlier this week we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses and therefore to exit the consumer small business and middlemarket banking operations there this was not a decision we took lightly we took a clinical look at our franchise in mexico and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction now to be clear these are terrific theyre scaled highreturning franchises but our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm as we did the work it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our institutional clients group in mexico citi is mexicos leading institutional bank weve served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century and that isnt going to change mexico has a bright future and we are committed to playing an important role in building it we expect mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead therefore we plan to maintain a significant locallylicensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and highreturning hub of our institutional network this wont be a simple transaction we have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders we will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring and of course there will be an opportunity to citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders this is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach investor day im really looking forward to talking to you about the future citi on march today we are going to talk you through the changes we are making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refresh strategy these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs amongst other things this is going to help make citi easier for our investors to understand youll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up citi going forward first we are creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment which will be run by anand selva this will consist of two distinct reporting units our us personal banking businesses and our global wealth management business which is going to include the private bank second on the institutional side of the house which will continue to be run by paco ybarra we will begin reporting under three units services banking and markets services will include treasury and trade solutions and security services and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to citis future finally we will create a new segment legacy franchises which will house all the businesses we intend to exit were going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on investor day in march now turning to earnings we had a decent end to as you can see on slide we closed out the quarter with net income of billion and eps of that includes a billion hit to ebit primarily related to the wind down of our korean consumer business excluding those impacts our net income would be billion with an eps of our net income for the full year of billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting rotce of in icg we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in ma and we continued to make significant investments in talent and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter equities finished up for the year the rebound tts is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes wasnt quite enough to offset the current rate environment but it bodes well for indeed we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates youve heard mark and i talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority and its yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products lots of our consumer businesses are still weathering covid disruptive impact on customer behavior in the us strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter deposits and aum continued to grow with digital deposits up nearly for the full year for the year we returned nearly billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by to we ended the year with a cet1 ratio of on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to absorb the impact of sacr now keep in mind that regulatory change didnt take effect until january while this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buybacks we will resume buybacks this quarter now that that impact has been addressed citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 finally as slide shows we are executing and delivering against our priorities a strategy refresh the transformation and our culture and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency first on the strategy we are laserfocused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors we have signed deals in six of the asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell four markets that we announced yesterday this means that within eight months of making the decision to exit these businesses we have a clear path in a majority of them and we are well into the process in the remaining markets in korea we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was the wind down our consumer operations and were able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter another area where we havent wasted any time is wealth management where we grew our ranks by a net advisors relationship managers and others over the course of the year they helped us add about private bank clients and citigold clients in in what weve known as us personal banking were seeing good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card and weve been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending and in addition to the progress were seeing in tts weve also been building out our security services platform we couldnt be more pleased to deepen our relationship with blackrock by becoming the largest custodian with their ishares etf second priority we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world this work its foundational to everything we want to achieve we are enhancing our operating model to improve longterm efficiency and our service to clients as it relates to the consent orders we are deep into execution mode we continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans third and relatedly we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability were driving this effort in a variety of ways including a more robust performance management process at this past year end shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders interests and various culturechanging initiatives a culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of one area that our people take particular pride in is our esg efforts later this month we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by a commitment i made on my first day as ceo months ago and of course we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate covid we certainly hope omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate whether macroeconomic such as inflation or geopolitical such as tensions with russia we have seen the resilience and the importance of citi as we supported our clients through uncharted waters and we will be with them in the next chapter as well so now id like to turn it over to mark and then we would be delighted to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone we have a lot to cover on todays call im going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail then im going to walk you through the financial impact from the asia market exits as well as mexico and changes we are making to our financial disclosure and then finally the quarterly results citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 as part of our strategy refresh weve started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy weve refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the icg businesses our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets turning to slide we lay out the details of the changes in financial reporting that jane mentioned first we intend to move the consumer small business and middlemarket banking operations of citibanamex and the asia consumer exits under a new segment called legacy franchises this will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits weve experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment this will free up the management teams of the goforward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firms strategy second we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to citi starting with icg we will move tts and security services to a reporting unit called services these businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering markets will therefore no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets and lastly on icg banking will only include advisory equity underwriting debt underwriting and corporate lending the global consumer bank gcb will be renamed personal banking and wealth management cbwm the private bank will move from icg to pbwm as a reminder we announced in january of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under citi global wealth now called global wealth management which is a distinct reporting unit the creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultrahigh net worth clients north america consumer will but renamed to us personal banking and will remain a reporting unit under pbwm this unit will continue to include branded cards retail services and retail banking we plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the icg and pbwm segments starting no later than the second quarter earnings and our investor day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our mediumterm vision and strategy for the firm slide shows the contribution of the citibanamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the asia markets hopefully this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits and in the appendix on page we have more detail on the asia exit markets and the deals that weve announced to date turning to mexico as jane mentioned we remain committed to mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there that said upon very careful consideration and analysis we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that were exiting the mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the latin america global consumer banking unit and the mexico middlemarket banking business that is currently included in citis institutional clients group segment citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 on the left side of the page we show key figures for and for the businesses we intend to exit in mexico in the businesses contributed billion of revenue and billion of net income the businesses in total had billion of loans billion of deposits and approximately billion of allocated tce again we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture paths so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known we will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in mexico in addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm now turning to slide as weve gone through our strategy refresh and simplification weve been reviewing our disclosure and terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers first revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income and revenue that we previously referred to as nonnir will now be called noninterest revenue second as you can see on the page weve revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits including fdic and foreign deposit insurance we have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a contra revenue in net interest income however beginning this quarter we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income and as a reminder this change is earnings neutral weve made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for to and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these two changes on slide we show financial results for the full firm as jane mentioned earlier in the fourth quarter we reported net income of billion and an eps of and rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results are costs of approximately billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the winddown of our korea consumer business as well as some additional asia exit impacts which i will collectively refer to as the asia divestiture impacts going forward excluding these impacts eps would have been with an rotce of approximately in the quarter total revenues increased by from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by icg specifically tts security services and investment banking was mostly offset by lower net interest income across gcb and icg our results include expenses of billion an increase of versus the prior year excluding the asia divestiture cost expenses would have increased by increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation businessled investments and higher revenuerelated expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter primarily driven by an acl release of approximately billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality now turning to the full year our revenues were down driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across icg and in particular in investment banking tts and security services our full year expenses were up but excluding asia divestiture costs our expenses were up citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 also for the full year we generated rotce of and excluding asiarelated divestiture impacts as a reminder we had a benefit of close to billion in acl releases for the full year on slide we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers in excluding asia divestiture impacts expenses were up in line with previous guidance looking forward we recognize that we have a lot more work to do the divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure were also taking a hard look at our structural expenses with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and selffunding investments we have a lot more to say about this at our investor day on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans in the fourth quarter net interest income increased by approximately million on a sequential basis driven by north america consumer sequentially net interest margin remained relatively stable on a yearoveryear basis net interest income was flat also on a yearover year basis average deposits grew in the quarter as we continued to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients particularly in north america average loans were roughly flat yearover year as growth in the icg was offset by a decline in gcb as the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates in our 10q we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet this is different from our peers methodology which tends to assume a static balance sheet assuming a static balance sheet and a 100basis point parallel shift we would expect citis total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over three times more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10q or roughly billion to billion of net interest income on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintain a very strong balance sheet of our trillion balance sheet about or billion consistent of hqla and we maintain total liquidity resources of approximately billion and we continued to optimize our balance sheet deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market as well as reducing our short term and longterm debt sequentially and yearoveryear on the loan side corporate loans represent approximately of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the us representing approximately of total loans and as weve mentioned in the past about of our total corporate loans are investment grade from a capital perspective we ended the year with a cet1 capital ratio of approximately as we prepared to adopt sacr on january having adopted sacr and maintained our capital ratio target were resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of as we look into the remainder of the year there are a number of variables with respect to capital these include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us along with the rest of the industry such as elevated gsib surcharges as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the asia exits and mexico in light of this you should expect us to manage to a cet1 ratio closer to by the end of the year due to the expected gsib surcharge increase at the beginning of that said we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a cet1 ratio of and as you know under the seb framework we can assess on a quarterbyquarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year with a goal of returning excess capital to shareholders citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group for the fourth quarter revenues increased yearoveryear driven by investment banking private bank and security services fees partially offset by a decline in markets expenses increased yearoveryear driven by transformation businessled investments and revenuerelated expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately million as net credit losses were more than offset by an acl release and we continue to see strong credit performance with net credit losses declining on a yearover year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and yearoveryear this resulted in net income of billion down approximately from the prior year largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller acl release versus the prior year and icg delivered a rotce for the quarter we also saw growth in both loans and deposits on a yearoveryear basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions as for the full year icg delivered approximately billion of net income on billion of revenue with an rotce of roughly on slide we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our icg business for the fourth quarter treasury and trade solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by growth in fees in fact our highest fee quarter ever and revenue did increase sequentially driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth we continue to see strong underlying drivers in tts on a yearoveryear basis that indicate continued strong client activity since this is the first time were showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum i want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents us dollar clearing transactions are up which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions crossborder flows were up these flows represent our global payment flows where we provide crossborder solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our tts and markets business in over currencies and importantly this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generates significant operating deposits commercial card volumes which reflect travel purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up again these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately of total ttsb revenue investment banking revenues are up yearoveryear driven by growth across products including record advisory performance the best advisory quarter weve had in over a decade private bank revenues were up yearoveryear as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions overall markets revenues were down versus last year and while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance the performance is against a very strong quarter last year fixed income markets revenues were down yearoveryear while we had solid growth in fx and commodities this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products equity markets revenues were down yearoveryear as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash security services revenues grew yearoveryear as fees grew driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody partially offset by interest rate headwinds citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 now turning to slide here we show the results for our global consumer banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars revenues declined yearoveryear driven by lower revenues across regions expenses were up yearoveryear driven by the asia divestiture cost excluding these costs expenses were up driven by transformation and businessled investments partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was a million benefit this quarter as an acl release more than offset net credit losses the ncl rate for the quarter was a decline of basis points yearoveryear and basis points sequentially we released over million of acl this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality partially offset by volume growth this resulted in a net income decline of and an rotce of excluding the asia divestitures impact net income would have grown and resulted in an rotce of as for the full year gcb delivered billion of net income on billion of revenues with an rotce of and excluding asia divestiture impacts on slide we show gcb revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter branded cards revenues declined yearoveryear on higher payment rates and portfolio mix were seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up card sales volumes up and average loans up in fact the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in by the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic retail services revenues declined yearoveryear driven by a decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance but despite this we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up and spend up on a yearoveryear basis while were encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses payment rates do remain stubbornly high impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses retail banking revenues declined yearoveryear driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue however underlying drivers remain strong with deposits up citigold household up and assets under management up yearoveryear as we continued to execute on our north america retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit asia revenues declined yearoveryear largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of aum growth of and growth in citigold and cpc clients latin america revenues declined yearoveryear mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards on slide we show results for corporateother for the fourth quarter revenues increased yearoveryear largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses are down yearoveryear largely due to the winddown of legacy assets cost of credit was benign at this point we typically give a full year outlook however since we have our investor day coming up on march we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about in the full context of our strategy and mediumterm performance expectations citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 as part of our strategy refresh our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible and i hope you like the new earnings presentation and we will continue to evolve it going forward and with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning mark thanks for all the detail there and jane for the strategic update mark i wanted to ask if you could just go over the restatement of the net interest income sensitivity just want to make sure we caught that whats the difference thats driving the new presentation there and just what are the key drivers for your net interest income outlook this year you dont have to give a number but kind of when you think about trading and then core nii and card growth maybe some of the thoughts there thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure thank you and good morning john so on slide is where i kind of covered that youll recall john that historically we have looked in our disclosure at a runoff balance sheet and that obviously has deposits running off as they term out it has loans running off as they mature others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet and so weve run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment obviously across all currencies we obviously have a mix of us dollar and foreign currencies as well and when we run that analysis now assuming the balance sheet is static that is the deposit levels loan levels et cetera that delivers three times more than what we disclosed in the q in the third quarter so thats the billion to billion of net interest income so obviously retaining or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same allow us to generate more net interest income and thats a major driver in the number range or the range that i provided john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc in term of sorry john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah no thats helpful citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc great in terms of the forward look im not going to give you guidance as you mentioned but i think there are a couple things that are important to keep in mind that were looking at for one is the drivers that we mentioned earlier so a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth and i would expect with an outlook for positive gdp that thats going to continue to play to our advantage in the second thing id point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in as many as three or four depending on the economist view that you listen to and that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have whether its our tts franchise or our private bank et cetera et cetera so those are important factors that impact the top line and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of i mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio for cards its really going to be about payment rates and how they taper off hopefully taper off theyve been stubbornly high through all of so hopefully we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interestearning balances in the back half of the year but those are important factors that need to play through into john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay great and then just as a followup as youre managing capital you mentioned youll return to some level of buybacks this quarter and youve got a lot of capital that you expect to free up in transactions that havent happened yet so i guess how are you kind of thinking about that future capital as something that youll deploy as you get it as part of your longterm thinking but youre not planning on using that throughout this year i assume mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so obviously we look at capital planning with a in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders and so as we think about the divestitures which are underway as that capital frees up were going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter and where we can were going to return that to shareholders so a number of deals are scheduled to close in that will be part of our plan and well be looking forward to taking those actions in the ph outer part of the year operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there mike citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you hear me mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc for you jane and im going to requeue after my two questions because i have so many the most thank you for the jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc indiscernible mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you for the new presentation but the biggest question that i and i think many investors have is when all is said and done who is citigroup whats the most simple statement you can give on who and what citigroup represents jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc oh i love that question so i would say that our vision for citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with crossborder needs well be a leader in global leader in wealth a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market and that is citi and our vision for it its a simpler firm more focused its much better connected its certainly simpler to operate characterized by a culture of excellence and accountability and i think as i hope weve shown today one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders interests mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and along those lines youre freeing up what about billion of capital now and intentions mark i always hear you say youre going to invest in the business youre going to do supply for growth and then youre going to buy back stock but in terms of a stock price thats this low i mean the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the alltime lows wouldnt you move buybacks up in the priority order or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter jane i mean youve done so much on the e side youve certainly done a lot on the s side but the g in esg when it relates to shareholders shareholders have been left back for so long just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc our shareholders are an enormous priority for us and mike i know we need to make the bank for shareholder aligned and friendly and we are doing so so let me give you four examples our strategy will generate and we will return excess capital to shareholders and as you say given where the stock is trading it makes buybacks highly attractive second were taking the structural and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value and you can see were executing and we are delivering with urgency and were very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today third were changing many elements of the financial reporting so its easier for our shareholders to understand the bank and were going to be as transparent as possible so you can measure our progress and results and i think the structure that mark laid out and i gave the highlevel on will make that job much easier and then finally and a topic i know youve been quite vocal around we are also making changes to compensation so more of our senior business leaders will be on the psus for this coming year weve moved to deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that were permitted to do so and were increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations there is a myriad of ph and lots of different actions that were taking because our shareholders matter to us and we want to get our valuation up to one that we think realizes its full potential operator your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much im going to indiscernible just for the sake of your answer i personally love that management teams are buried in the stock that they have investors to invest in but to be a leader in all those areas that you want to be in indiscernible question you got to spend a lot to keep up and so my question is how do you balance doing all of that and closing profitability gap with spending enough and feeding your franchises to be leaders and yet the expenses indiscernible so hard id just love to hear your thoughts mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i have to apologize you broke up through much of that question would you mind just repeating the tail end of it theres a lot of static on the line here jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc wait wait wait sometime glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi absolutely sorry ph ill take off the headset is this any better citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc say a little bit more im sorry were getting a lot of static should we come back glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi sure thing mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me okay hello jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc we can betsy hi there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi okay so a couple of questions one just thinking through the walk from where you are today in cet1 till the end of the year when you mentioned youd be ending the year at you have some businesses that are exiting which should reduce rwas i would think but then youve got debt buybacks as well coming through and at the same time i would expect that youd probably want to grow your rwas i know your rwas were down  and maybe that was a part of the reason why ficc was a little light so could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that cet1 change because it will have some impact on how were thinking about the rev growth in the markets business mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah good question so we are looking at obviously how we continue to invest in the franchise particularly where there are areas of growth at the same time ensure that were delivering buybacks for return to shareholders as i look at the cet1 ratio were ending the year at about as you know sacr kicks in or has kicked in on january were ending therefore on january at roughly around where our target is and over the course of the year well be able to absorb growth in the businesses where theres a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both sacr but also lowreturning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 and so as we look at that plan the start of the year which is close to our target towards the end of we will have to build that back up to about in order to absorb the gsib headwind assuming theres no relief provided to that which then kicks in at the beginning of and so through the course of the year well utilize through rwa well free up capital and return capital to shareholders well generate more earnings but at the end of the year well need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc do you have a sense as to how much the benefit to like gsib or scb should be from all the divestitures youre doing i was actually thinking when i saw the mexico news this week that maybe that was one of the reasons why you decided to exit the mexico consumer businesses as potentially the pickup that youd get since you mentioned it makes you a simpler company and that should feed into scb i would think mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its not a major driver as to the decision as jane has kind of framed out but it does factor into the points that youve raised so from a gsib point of view theres i dont know billion or so of deposits that are tied to our mexico consumer business that would drive about basis points or so or points i should say on the gsib score the total for the divestitures that weve earmarked its about billion in deposits and so you can do the math that wed get some benefit from that youre right and we i dont have numbers that i would share at this point in part because the fed has to run their analysis but youre right from a ccar point of view when you think about the stress capital buffer theres an impact to ppnr but more importantly to stress losses that will play through as well as you know that impact as well as the deposit impact wont really come into play until weve closed on these transactions but it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longerterm capital planning and it certainly is something that im going to talk more about at investor day on march betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and the lowreturning assets that you were talking about exiting is that like thats basically something like rates in the fixed income business and should we expect some impact there or again im just trying to tie together the decline in rwas and the comment that fixed income business was a little light this quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah im not looking to be specific on where the lowreturning assets were getting out but were certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those lowreturning assets exist as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and dont necessarily link across the franchise and so this is something that jane and i along with paco are keenly focused on we realize that while weve seen growth in markets and in ficc it has come with growth in the balance sheet and we want to make sure that were optimizing the use of the capital operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi good morning my first question is for mark please and by the way thank you so much for this new way of disclosing financials i think this will be very helpful and the nii sensitivity as well i know were going to get a lot more detail in march but as we think about the expense base that was remaining post the exits youve identified could you help us get a sense of how much more growth would there be left in the remediationrelated expenses how aggressive do you plan to be in terms of investment spend in and do you think youve identified enough inefficient expenses within the franchise to help fund some of those both initiatives mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah great question you know im not going to give guidance on but let me try and frame out how were thinking about it because i think it is important both jane and i recognize that weve got theres a lot of static were getting excuse me so in terms of the expenses we obviously have a large expense base weve seen growth play out this year but i think theres some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base and thats exactly what we intend to do so if you think about the divestitures ill start there for a second theres some billion of expenses tied to divestitures as those divestitures get closed out some of that will naturally go away the balance of that which tends to be referred to as stranded costs were already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded costs the second point that ill bring up around this is the transformation the transformation has driven percentage points of growth this year i do expect that theres more growth associated with that particularly since were still doing more hiring theres more tech spend that will be required but the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies will reduce the manual touchpoints will drive straight through processing and therefore will allow for us to bring our expenses down and the final piece that ill mention is the strategy and so jane mentioned in our strategy a focus on core businesses and thats going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm we do about million to million of productivity savings a quarter thats not enough we think theres more opportunity for efficiencies than that and its those opportunities that were going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years more on that at investor day erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for framing that jane this next question is for you when you responded to mikes question about your vision of citi you led with your vision of citi as the worlds corporate bank if i could rephrase how is your vision of citi what does it include in terms of your funding base theres a lot of conversation particularly in the beginning of a rising rate environment about the natural gap that you have to your largest us peers with regards to your naturally higher rate deposits right and so how do you envision your funding base evolving over time and do you have any interest in significantly building out your us retail deposit franchise citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so erika weve got a pretty diverse funding base when we look at it from the institutional side weve got the numberone tts franchise globally and that has material funding from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there our wealth franchise both from the ultrahigh net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us obviously were making the exits on the international consumer banking front and weve been focused in the retail bank in the us in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that that business generates a stable lowcost funding for the firm here in the us and well expect to continue growing that going forward operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi that was sooner than i expected just to followup on the compensation changes yes thats good news that people are paid in stock instead of just cash and stock but you had the new bonus arrangement i did not think that was finalized but as part of the new bonus arrangement based on the next threeyear financial targets is that still all cash or is that cash and stock or is that stock jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc im assuming youre referring to the transformation award is that correct mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so that one while its paid in cash for the first two pieces the last is pegged to our threeyear stock performance and we felt that that was the appropriate balance here as we said transformation is our highest priority we need to successfully address the concerns raised and thats in our shareholders interest one of the pieces thats important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns its a shift in our culture and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here so its an important part of delivering and of course if we fail to deliver the outcomes of the transformation and are not successful in the execution there will be no award mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and when will we find i guess well find out about those targets at investor day so answering that question as it relates to psus how much was given in cash before and how many people will this apply to versus where it was before citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc the psus are given to the executive management team and now were extending that to the broader operating team which includes the leaders of our major businesses and youll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in march so youll get all of that information at roughly the same time operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks a lot good morning mark i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the card business in aggregate definitely starting to see a little bit of that balance but i wonder if you could touch on number one like just how youre expecting that balance trajectory to go number two spend versus lend and how much youre seeing in that and then three just the losses are obviously just amazingly low and how would you anticipate card normalization thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so as ive mentioned before i mean when you look at whats going on with cards across the board we are seeing increases in spend volume so branded cards spend volume is up retail services spend volumes up so very healthy spend volume people are using our cards which is a good thing in terms of the liquidity thats still out there in the market even though savings rates have started to normalize theres still a significant amount of liquidity thats out there in the market and thats showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and frankly in some of the international card businesses as well and that has not subsided and so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans average loans are up branded cards the endofperiod loans were up what matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest and so weve spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions our new account acquisitions are up in branded cards and weve been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well so getting a very good response in terms of new accounts coming onboard weve also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity just kind of to broaden the lending that were doing with this customer base and weve seen significant growth in our flex loan flex pay products as weve targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them on to that product so very good growth there in fact in weve not only gotten the growth just in aggregate but if i look at kind of installment lending weve gotten of the total installment sales are in digital sales which is another kind of lowcost acquisition approach that weve taken so good underlying indicators there but again its not until payment rates start to subside we would expect hope that that would start to show up towards the back half of in terms of the losses which was the other part of your question very low loss levels you heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier when i look at the loss rates earlier when i look at delinquency trend theres really nothing to focus on there they remain quite low and we dont see any signs or any areas of concern i would say but i would imagine those two would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great mark thanks and then just a followup you mentioned the strongest quarter in advisory in a while i was just wondering if you could just comment broadly on investment banking pipelines across the product groups thanks a lot mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah the investment banking pipeline looks very strong we ended the year with significant growth in advisory up yearoveryear well above the wallet weve grown share there ecm was up about again above the wallet and really that reflecting some of the fees coming from spac activity so very good growth emea and north america are both up yearoveryear due to continued momentum in ma so we feel very good about it we think the pipeline still looks very strong we think the investments that weve made in bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up sectors such as healthcare technology sponsors group those investments are certainly starting to pay off so we feel good about it operator your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right lets try this again jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc oh much better glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah all righty all righty so i think we have a good longterm process in motion and measured in more than one year but what do you think of the sort of it feels like returns have to go down before they go up i know you have the overall goal to close the gap to peers but between the capital that gets freed up the gsib buffer in the denominator the capital markets partially normalizing some stranded expenses on sold franchises and then continuing to execute on the transformations is it okay and is it normal i think its partially in our models that we go down first and then rise up mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so thank you glenn so look if you look at with a rotce and reserve releases that get close to billion id have to say yes right because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that now its important to compare that to where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves but as we look at the forward look which well take you through in more detail as jane mentioned were focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns and thats where our energies are going to be focused and we think thats whats going to help to drive improved returns over time citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi fair enough the reserve releases have a big impact okay and then in terms of that growth i think a couple of questions dance around this so you could be short but given your answer to what citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise in all those industries or business lines i should say how do you balance ph that youre doing whats right for stockholders in the nearterm drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future because each one of those is super competitive each one of them has competitors as early as today or as recent as today spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces how do you balance that invest for the longterm would be great versus improve the stock shortterm mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so let me start and then jane feel free to add in if youd like so the first thing i think its important to remember is the focus that were trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time so were prioritizing how were going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity the second thing id say is that we are investing in the franchise for the longterm right as opposed to trying to hit some shortterm metric and so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed and so that is the way we approach this with again an eye towards ensuring that were clear and transparent with our investors and that if theres excess that were returning that to our shareholders so theyre not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc right id also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in as mark said theyre highreturning ones so our services businesses are much capital lighter highreturn wealth management the same and i think the opportunities that weve been seeing to continually increase share in investment banking another highreturning business so that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that youre talking about and not everything needs an enormous investment if i look at wealth for example you put the different pieces together that weve already got and were putting them into a single integrated business and proposition its not things that were starting from scratch so a lot of this is incremental operator ladies and gentlemen please limit your questions to one question and one followup your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello jane and mark a quick one firstly now that youre exiting mexico singapore and hong kong were not part of the exits when you announced the exit from the markets in the consumer business are you going to stay on with the consumer business in those markets or meaning a traditional consumer business as youve had for years or is that going to change jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 no we find that the franchises we have in singapore and hong kong just given the nature of them are really naturally tied to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform as you say so we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in two of the most major wealth hubs in the world vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and a followup question if i may have the nii change mark that you made what deposit beta are you assuming there and how much of the change is coming from us net interest income versus the rest of the currencies mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so we havent shared our deposit betas but as you would imagine the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side and so thats that piece and im sorry the second part of your question was what vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hello vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah can you hear me mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes i can hear you now what was the second part of your question im sorry vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay the second part was how much of the change in net interest income from the interest rate sensitivity change mark that youre making mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc how much is the us net interest income versus the rest of the currencies citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the increase is roughly skewed towards the international so id say of a billion increase id say about two thirdsonethird international vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and thats because theres where you were assuming that runoff mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats where you were assuming more of the balance sheet runoff mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of charles peabody with portales charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc yeah a question regarding the regulatory and political risk to share buybacks and i ask that because earlier this week in the powell renomination hearings when you listen to the last two minutes of that testimony sherrod brown went on a rail against buybacks in the banking industry and then last year i think president biden had two speeches in which he spoke out against buybacks so im trying to understand is there i mean a transaction tax isnt going to stop you guys from doing buybacks but are there other things being discussed out there other than just moral suasion to discourage buybacks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah were going to do the right thing for our shareholders and right now particularly given where the stocks trading buybacks are a very very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take so no were very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc no i understand that you want to im just trying to understand what the risk to your desires are from the regulatory or political side jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i dont believe there is one were extremely wellcapitalized i think weve heard it consistently from washington the confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic and were not overly concerned on that front mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve but thats exactly right charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc all right and then as a followup just on that subject assuming these regulators just getting into their seats theyre probably not going to be able to do anything this year on buybacks but im assuming that theyll try and do something on buybacks next year so you want to do as much buyback shortterm as you can and youve talked about getting back to like a billion pace here in the first quarter how sustainable is that billion pace mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look i mean first of all with the scb framework we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarter byquarter basis obviously theres another ccar run that well all go through that will determine at least part of the capital stack and then obviously theres the gsib thats coming into play so we factor all of those things in in our case as we develop the capital plan we also will take a look at the divestitures and in some instances the divestitures will generate tce for us to return to shareholders there may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in but its part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning mark good morning jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey gerard jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us when you think about the strategy refresh that is underway are we complete complete mark you alluded to maybe some of the markets businesses that may not have the returns you want there could be some area but ph were you there and by the investor day can we assume that it will be completed jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc in terms of the timeline to this one this particular exercise is ph drawing to a close in terms of what i call the big step back as a new ceo so we said this is the last major structural decision that were taking in mexico were now focused on pulling together everything from investor day and thats where the new reporting structure i think that weve announced today is also a very important foundation for that so im confident that weve made the right big structural decisions and that were looking forward to investor day laying out the vision the strategies and the plan for going forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and let me be clear gerard just in case i wasnt im not suggesting were exiting parts of our markets business that is not what im suggesting at all what i am suggesting is that as we would always do were constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet capital rwa et cetera and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of lowreturning assets that we have we do that all right and so with rule changes like sacr and the like either pricing will adjust or well have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense and thats more of what i meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the markets business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no theyre very clear thank you mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and just as a quick followup obviously some of the businesses youre committed to tss the investment banking area you guys clearly are players there you have economies of scale when you look at the other businesses that youre committed to stay in where is the heavy lifting going to come from where you really got to step it up to get those economies of scale similar to the ones that are quite obvious jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah youre right we have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets if we look at tts we are moving trillion of volume daily there so those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization around data and in terms of where are we looking at getting more to of increasing our citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 scale commercial bank is obviously one where we have a commercial banking presence in different markets around the world and theyre very focused on the same target market i talked about in the vision which are those midmarket companies with global needs or multimarket needs and then the other areas in terms of wealth where weve already begun as you can see from our earlier remarks building out our frontline scale on the back of the platforms and other investments that were making mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and to your point jane commercial bank this year huge opportunity to leverage more of the tts offering that we have were already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of cmo and other markets products and the revenue this year was up yearoveryear and similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth but those are two key areas i agree operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon just quick couple of followups mark on the capital return i just wanted to make sure indiscernible when we think about the billion pace youre going to get back to in moving forward is there more upside risk with that billion or could that be actually lower i just want to make sure we have that right in terms of expectations mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah im not giving expectations for the quarterbyquarter capital buyback decisions in part because as i mentioned with the new scb rule were able to look at it on a quarterly basis so im not giving guidance beyond that well talk more about the capital plan on march broadly right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just i guess going back jane on us retail i think the question is is there something more meaningful that we should expect at the investor day and its fine if you want to hold it till then because if i recall correctly you were a partner with google that didnt play out the big question that investors have is is there a better definition to the us retail franchise and im just wondering will we get that at march investor day or theres nothing radical that you have in store at least in the nearterm as far as us retail is concerned jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc youll be certainly hearing directly from anand who is responsible for that business on investor day and hell lay out all of our us personal banking strategy of what were looking at both from our top two cards franchise and our plan what were doing in personal lending as well as what were doing in wealth and then obviously the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those two core drivers of growth for us in the states so yes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 got it thank you operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good afternoon mark maybe on just the expenses i appreciate all of the moving parts with the divestitures and youre not going to give us the full year expense guidance number but can you help on the jumpingoff point at the first quarter we had compensation was up about billion quarteroverquarter how much of that was just sort of the comp changes or is that a good run rate to think about so if you could just help us just the jumpingoff point for first quarter would be helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah you know what im not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that i mean what i would say is again you got a couple things that played through that will be important factors in one the hiring that weve done were going to get a full year impact of that at least for part of that in so thats going to play out some of the if you think about the mix for the transformation spend which is a mix of both hires thirdparty spend as well as technology that mix will start to shift over time away from thirdparty for sure and towards the others and so were going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in in terms of the comp specifically in the fourth quarter we obviously tie the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues and so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers i mentioned earlier we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of but id rather not get into the specifics here given that were going to give you a better sense for it in early march jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay just maybe as a followup on that just so i understand the sequential drivers so youre saying its mostly incentive comp or was that more new hires or both just from to change mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah in to youve got both hires as well as incentive comp jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay all right thanks operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i just wanted to follow up you had said the sale of mexico wouldnt be an easy transaction and was just hoping you could elaborate on that and then just related you talked about the capital thats allocated to the business citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 being freed up but any kind of initial thoughts on whether the transaction the exit of the business will generate a gain or loss as we think about the combined or total capital impact thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc why dont i kick that off and mark jump in as i said it wont be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the institutional business from the businesses that were exiting and thats something that we kicked off yesterday that process and then well be looking to go to the market in the spring and to be active with buyers potential buyers in a few months time so its more just the complexity of separating the bank weve got good plans behind this and as i said in my remarks these are terrific mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc these are scaled these are great franchises and theres obviously a lot of speculation in the press which is too early to comment on but we do think this is a jewel for someone its just not for us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i agree and i think its premature to speculate on structure of the deal and things of that sort youre right we do have about billion of tce allocated to the business the other layer of complexity is around the cta and youve heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the australia sale and i introduced it as a complexity because theres an accounting treatment associated with the cta that happens at signing that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing so with a cta the capital impact flows through aoci but its neutral once the deal is closed and in mexico the consumer business would have a dta of a little bit less than billion or so and so thats another factor thats involved with the transaction jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc a cta not a dta mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc did i say dta jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 im sorry cta currency translation adjustment jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc indiscernible paying attention mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you cta thank you very much jane matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc well actually even before asking my question i just wanted to echo some of the earlier remarks the new presentation the additional detail its really helpful so appreciate the new disclosure mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc mark im going to ask well i guess technically one question but its really a threeparter you might need to grab a pen and paper but i wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the nii sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers you noted there more than three times increase in nii assuming a static balance sheet but theres still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest nii growth that we saw in the last cycle and first question just wanted to start by asking given your heavier institutional deposit gearing wouldnt it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit runoff would actually be greater than peers citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 two does the nii guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the markets business and could you help us size that potential drag and then just lastly its more of a catchall any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better nii outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here and you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable theres still going to be a difference between us and peers but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis we do have a skew towards institutional clients and they do carry a higher beta associated with them but we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well in terms of the impact through markets the impact i think the markets impact can come in any number of ways i think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books in terms of the last part of your question i dont think theres anything else that i would point to i mean obviously with the excess liquidity that weve seen and been carrying in the market weve been putting that to work in investments weve increased our investment portfolio by some billion we expanded the duration to about ph years and we still have significant dry powder to put to work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment which we expect steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color mark thanks so much for accommodating the multipart question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of jeff harte with piper sandler jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co hey im sorry i just thought ive taken myself out of the queue my questions have been answered and you all must be getting tired so im done thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thanks jeff operator your final question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc mr mayo citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey one more question whats the hardest part of the call to change jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc probably its been breaking down some of the silos and that the point on the principles we laid out mike of connected is really a key piece of it weve rolled out some new leadership principles last year and its very much around how do we get the firm very wellconnected and really realize the full synergies so breaking some of those old habits i would say the new structure is certainly helping us at the different initiatives were taking mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and how long do you think that will take because youre breaking down a culture thats been ingrained for quite some time jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i would say im really happy with the progress weve been one of the first things i did was laid the firm to on our culture out when i took over and weve got a terrific team of people being working at this for years so im very happy with the progress we make i think everyones clear we want the culture to be one of accountability of excellence and acting with urgency and part of that is well underway but itll take a little bit longer operator there are no further questions i will turn the call over to jen landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor
