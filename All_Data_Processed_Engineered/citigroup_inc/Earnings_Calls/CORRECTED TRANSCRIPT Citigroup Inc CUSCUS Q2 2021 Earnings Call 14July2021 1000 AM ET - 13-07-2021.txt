partnership and support over the past few years with that said let me turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you liz and good morning to everyone im delighted to join you again today and first im going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as ceo and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities for the quarter we reported billion in net income or per share we continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses indeed the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence and this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week i just spent in london now clearly we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world but we are optimistic about the momentum ahead and as a result we deliberately accelerated some of our investments in our institutional businesses we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of  last year and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter looking forward we do expect the volatile markets to be higher than precovid levels performance in our investment banking franchise remained healthy with good momentum in ma and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year we saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues with doubledigit growth in our icg fee revenues and specifically over yearoveryear fee growth in treasury and trade solutions in securities services and in the private bank now tts is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients and while the business continues to be impacted by low rates we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the postpandemic recovery takes shape in consumer banking while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards spending is well above precovid levels now with a increase in global purchase sales yearoveryear we expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year and we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and aums across our consumer franchises in the us as we discussed were investing in our home market as demonstrated by the wellreceived launch of our innovative custom cash card in june internationally the picture for our consumer businesses diverges so while there is still the softness in the mexican economy in asia loan growth returned and thats despite new covid outbreaks turning to capital for the first two quarters of we returned close to billion to our shareholders which was the maximum amount permitted under the federal reserves rules going forward were committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise so while our stress capital buffer increased to as a result of the feds recent stress test that wont impact the common equity tier citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 target weve been managing to of approximately we ended the quarter at on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program lastly our tangible book value per share increased to up over from a year ago now lets turn to three of our strategic priorities strategy transformation and talent im very pleased with the progress weve made on our strategy refresh we have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the consumer markets we plan to exit in asia and emea the first round of this was very encouraging and competitive which isnt a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners in those regions were off to a running start in our wealth strategy were making significant strategic investments in product capabilities technology and talent and have already seen this in increased client acquisition we continue to do thorough and rigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer institutional businesses guided by the four principles i outlined to you earlier in the year being clinical being focused and ensuring both connectivity and simplification our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth the three most notable of which are tts wealth and commercial banking and im very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us as we have done so far we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy and we are also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an investor day which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year were going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of you so you can then hold us accountable for executing against it as we discussed in the call last quarter were also working very hard and diligently on our transformation this is a significant its also an exciting body of work and were working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter now while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves weve set out to modernize our bank we want to achieve nothing less than excellence and this means investing in our risk and control environment but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world so let me give you an example in tts these investments will improve the scalability of our platform automation will drive efficiency and client experience and investments in data will enhance revenues and the investments were making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank and that leads me finally to talent where we have made material progress over the last few months im delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation weve enhanced our existing ranks with bestinmarket hires in data risk strategy and controls as well as in the front lines of wealth the commercial bank and bcma in particular we continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities and its this combination of new perspectives and our existing high caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence urgency and accountability now before i turn it over to mark i would like to thank liz lynn for her great work leading our investor relation efforts over the past several years and as you know and as she mentioned she is going to be our finance lead for bcma where we all know that she is going to do a wonderful job citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 with that mark will go through our presentation and then well both be happy to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone starting on slide citigroup reported second quarter net income of billion eps of and a rotce revenues declined from the prior year reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates expenses were up yearoveryear in constant dollars expenses were up reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments partially offset by productivity savings credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of billion more than offset by an acl release of billion reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook in constant dollars endofperiod loans declined yearoveryear reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer although i would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge and for the first time in over a year loans were up sequentially deposits grew modestly up year overyear reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients looking at the first half of total revenues declined yearoveryear and in constant dollars mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in icg excluding fixed income markets total expenses were up on a reported basis and in constant dollars midway through the year ill talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment cost of credit was a benefit of roughly billion as we released over billion in reserves and we delivered roughly billion in net income and an rotce of finally as jane noted earlier we returned roughly billion in capital so far this year and we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the scb framework turning now to each business slide shows the results for the institutional clients group for the quarter icg delivered ebit of billion up significantly from last year revenues decreased driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets expenses increased and were up in constant dollars as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings credit costs were down considerably given a roughly million acl release as well as lower net credit losses and icg delivered a return on allocated capital slide shows revenues for the institutional clients group in more detail product revenues were down in the second quarter primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period particularly in fixed income markets however we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise including tts investment banking securities services commercial banking and the private bank and excluding the markets related component noninterest revenues were up this quarter and we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 looking at the results in greater detail on the banking side revenues decreased in treasury and trade solutions significant growth in fee revenues of roughly reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates with revenues down were continuing to see momentum across our payments business with growth in crossborder flows and growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards and as of the end of the quarter tts loans grew roughly reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions investment banking revenues were up as higher ma and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting while the overall dcm wallet was up in the second quarter all the growth was in noninvestment grade which did not benefit our results given our skew to investment grade but looking at results versus a more normal year revenues were up versus the second quarter of with strong growth across all products private bank revenues grew driven by higher fees and lending volumes reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates corporate lending revenues were down primarily driven by lower volumes total markets and securities services revenues decreased from last year fixed income revenues decreased reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period in both rates and spread products however we remained engaged with our clients with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average equities revenues were up versus last year primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions in securities services revenues were up on a reported basis and in constant dollars here we saw a strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes partially offset by lower spreads finally looking at first half results in icg weve seen a strong contribution from investment banking as well as good results in the private bank and securities services which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets i would also note that equity markets revenues are up over turning now to the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars on slide for the quarter gcb delivered ebit of billion up significantly from last year revenues declined as continued strong deposit growth albeit with lower spreads and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances across all three regions in cards while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending with purchase sales up close to versus last year and almost versus last quarter we are still seeing the impact of high payment rates on revenues expenses increased reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume related costs from the low point a year ago partially offset by efficiency savings credit remains healthy and credit costs decreased significantly driven by the billion acl reserve release and lower net credit losses and gcb delivered a return on allocated capital finally looking at results for the first half of the year weve seen steady improvement in our drivers which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail second quarter revenues were down from last year primarily driven by lower cards revenues but better than the decline last quarter on a year overyear basis revenues declined in both branded cards and retail services by and respectively reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances this is creating pressure on our net interest revenues but its also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends however we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity with purchase sales now above pre pandemic levels led by discretionary spend including travel and dining in branded cards total purchase sales were up versus last year and importantly up versus the second quarter of and in retail services purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter and so the good news is that were continuing to see the recovery in spend and were also returning to pre covid acquisition levels looking ahead we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates and consumers return to more normal payment patterns turning to retail banking revenues were down yearoveryear reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues that said we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships average deposits were up including growth in checking and the number of citigold households increased by contributing to a increase in aums on slide we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars revenues declined year overyear in the second quarter with an decline in latin america and a decline in asia looking at international consumer overall we are seeing good momentum in investment management with growth in assets under management primarily driven by asia and the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs average deposit growth remains strong at albeit at lower deposit spreads and similar to the us we saw a increase in purchase sales yearoveryear but cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter with average card loans down due to elevated payment rates slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends in the us both ncl and delinquency rates remain favorable driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs given the delinquency trends were seeing today we do not expect credit deterioration in the us portfolio in and the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit and as expected credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both mexico and asia following a peak in the first quarter of so overall were seeing a rebound in activity along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year slide shows the results for corporateother revenues were down slightly in dollar terms as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed onetime items in the prior year expenses were up slightly in dollar terms mainly reflecting the impact of fx and similar to last quarter we have further allocated costs to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure risk and controls as we mentioned previously this change had no impact to ebit at the citi level however we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 credit costs declined yearoveryear driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year finally ebit was breakeven this quarter looking ahead we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of million to million for the remainder of slide shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis weve also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on slide in the appendix for a comparison to prior periods in the second quarter net interest revenue of billion declined million yearoveryear reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates sequentially net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues and net interest margin declined basis points driven by lower cards nir and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits partially offset by the increase in markets nir in the quarter turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide in the second quarter nonnir declined billion driven by normalization in fixed income markets however outside of markets we did see strong broadbased fee growth of over million across gcb and icg and for the past two quarters weve seen these fee revenues return to prepandemic levels of roughly billion per quarter pointing to a somewhat fasterthan expected recovery looking at these results midway through the year we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total citi revenues to be down in the midsingle digit range on a full year basis although the composition is likely to be somewhat different which i will talk more about in a moment on slide we show our key capital metrics which remain strong and stable again this quarter allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders our cet1 capital ratio increased to as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends during the quarter citi returned a total of billion to common shareholders in the form of billion in dividends and share repurchases of billion our supplementary leverage ratio was a decline from the prior quarter largely driven by the expiration of a temporary slr relief and our tangible book value per share grew by to driven by net income before we move on to qa let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for on the top line for total citigroup we still expect revenues to be down midsingle digits on a reported basis but as i mentioned the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated yeartodate weve seen stronger than expected growth in noninterest revenues and we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year driven primarily by icg meanwhile for net interest revenues we expect continued stabilization in the back half and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year so while net interest revenues are down roughly billion yeartodate just outside our original outlook for the full year assuming this base case holds we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis so again in aggregate for total citigroup we still expect revenues to be down midsingle digits on the expense side based on our latest work on the strategic refresh weve made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster than expected recovery as a result we now expect total citigroup expenses to be up midsingle digits these are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive longterm growth citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 for example weve accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth including holistically across wealth and the commercial bank weve also doubled down on our existing strengths in businesses like tts securities services and the investment banking business finally given the faster recovery we are seeing today we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside all of these investments will have significant benefits over time meanwhile expenses related directly to the transformation which we had expected to drive the to increase in total citi expenses this year are coming in largely as expected these investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment leading to faster decisionmaking better efficiency and improved client experience and id point out that the mix of this spend is technology and nontech related investments finally this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments weve been making over the past few years and to be clear we will continue as we have done in the past to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period and one additional note we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing and as ive mentioned previously we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials so in summary we feel good about the investments that we are making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time before we get started with questions also want to take a moment to thank liz lynn for her time as the head of citi investor relations liz has been with the citi ir team since and has led the group since i know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since i was named cfo a little over two years ago she will be moving on to be the chief financial officer for our investment banking business and as liz mentioned jen landis will be joining us in august as our new head of investor relations i hope you will all join me in congratulating liz on her new role and welcoming jen to citi at our next earnings call with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead with your questions john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mark thanks for the comments at the end there about the expense outlook and the revision to your outlook for this year just wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more youre not the only bank thats been kind of raising expense guidance so i was wondering how much of this might be inflationary to the cost of doing business as a big bank here and how much is citi specific and does the run rate that youre expecting to be at on expenses in the back half of this year feel like thats the run rate youd go into next year with or are there things that are elevated this year thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah good morning john thanks for the question look i start by saying and repeating a little bit of what i said in my remarks which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise right and so what i spoke to was jane and i along with the leadership team are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh and as we go through that we are identifying particularly given the pace of the recovery some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise and we dont want to were not going to miss this window of opportunity youve heard me mention that before and its in part to the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning so when we talk about tts we talk about the commercial banking business we talk about wealth those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of in a normal environment and so like i said were jumping at that on the transformation side ive been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the to increase yearoveryear thats coming in largely as expected and again the right thing to do and important thing to do to modernize this bank inflation of course is going to be a factor particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent but again thats we deal with that on a regular basis and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that in terms of im not going to give any guidance on that but again this is i think an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure were putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future operator your next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport research james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners sorry i was on mute there for a second good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners maybe the first question hey good morning maybe first question on branded cards in north america average balances were pretty flat but there was a little pressure on spread can you just maybe clear that up is that just sort of greater user rate activity or does that bounce back how do we think about the revenue trajectory there and the spread compression we saw this quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so again the dynamic on cards revenues branded cards in particular in north america which were down is largely driven by what were seeing in the way of loan balances and if you look at average interest earning balances our average interest earning balances for branded cards are down about now the good news is as weve said purchase sale activity is up meaningfully yearoveryear and relative to the prior quarter but its really those payment rates are remaining quite high quite elevated the good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit lower losses than expected and now lower reserves as we see releases but its really that dynamic of payment rates high lower loan volumes average interest earning in particular that is putting pressure on that top line james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners all right thats helpful for the clarification on the transactor balances and then maybe just more broadly on the wealth business you guys put out a press release saying you made some significant investments in new hires in asia wealth with a pretty substantial and aggressive target to grow head count where do you stand on that build out and are you making similar investments in other markets jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes look i think as we said were pretty excited about the wealth opportunity for us because we have all the different pieces to be successful here the brand the client relationships the platform the commercial banking franchise and were already a sizable player were number three in asia for example where a lot of the growth is coming from the opportunity for us is pulling all of the pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients and so weve been investing in that platform the technology youll have seen the announcement yesterday in the us about a selfdirected digital offering there weve been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well and are very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth which is where from a mix point of view we see the greatest upside for us so early days in the execution of this but i think pleasing progress as we pull this together into this single integrated offering invest behind it and youll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane only thing i would add to that we are already seeing good performance in the quarter right so private bank revenues up continued strong growth in client assets up including aums that were up and deposit strength et cetera and as jane mentioned even as we invest in strengthening the platform we just announced yesterday that we were launching the selfdirected investment digital offering which again is targeted towards us consumer and wealth management clients and so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here operator your next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley hello betsy your line is open please proceed with your question and we will move to the next question in queue your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning jane and mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc wanted to ask you a little bit just on capital when we got the scb results you had indicated a dividend of at least and implied that youd be buying back stock but just wondering if you could help us just flush that out a little bit more in terms of how we should be thinking about the type of capital return or any increases that you might consider on the dividend from here and how to put that into context with prospective changes in the scb and your minimums mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure look the first thing id say is that as you can tell through the second quarter we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income and so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return as it relates to the scb and the recent results as you know we have a target of approximately from a cet1 ratio point of view the target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer thats somewhere between and up until this recent set of results the prior couple had been at the the will go into effect at the end of the third quarter and more importantly we will actively manage the drivers that impact that stress capital buffer that is to say ppnr as well as the balance sheet risk weighted assets and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that stress capital buffer back down as we think about capital actions as you know with the scb in place we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter in line with the reg minimums and we intend to do that given where the stock trades it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so well continue to skew towards that and as of right citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 now our dividend is going to remain at the but as i mentioned we will continue to look at that quarterto quarter given the flexibility from the scb jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and the only piece id add in is as were doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward both mark and i have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what well be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc ph great operator your next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i just wanted to follow up on the dividend commentary i understand the preference to buy back stock and youre very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible book so that makes sense but i guess just kind of signaling the market keeping a stable dividend is there like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend because id think youd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies just to kind of signal a positive trend because it doesnt take that much capital to do that so maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend again specifically on should we read into implied underlying earnings power are there any limits on increasing the dividend thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me be very clear theres no underlying message there at all right its as i stated in terms of where the stock is trading and it making sense to do buybacks our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers at close to and so and theres no constraint on our ability to take capital actions and we dont have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise and in fact many of the areas as i mentioned earlier and as jane has mentioned we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power so well capitalized we feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to and again we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer as we go quartertoquarter to adjust as we see fit in the best interest of our investors operator operator instructions your next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research hello steven your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc sorry i was muted as well my apologies mark i was hoping to unpack just some of the nii guidance i think there was just a little bit of confusion how it should be interpreted so it sounds like were down billion year citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 todate and that the full year we shouldnt see any incremental declines from there so that would imply about billion nii run rate in the back half i just want to make sure thats the right way to interpret the remarks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look again we do see kind of the nir stabilizing and you see some of that particularly exmarkets but also in total on the page again the guidance for total revenue is unchanged at down down midsingle digits excuse me youre right as of the half were at down as relates to net interest revenues look the markets component of that can often be hard to predict but what im suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter operator your next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi can you hear me now mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes hey betsy good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh hey thanks okay i did have a question for jane and you mark the question has to do with how youre thinking about the importance of scale in the business refresh i guess i could call it that youre doing and jane really maybe you could help us understand how important scale is in what youre looking to execute here i ask because many times i get questions from investors around what is citi doing on the pieces of the business that dont have as much scale as the standout areas like global fixed or treasury services or mexico jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes first of all scale is clearly very very important here particularly in a more digital world and as you point out betsy tts for example has were moving trillion of volume a day around the world and weve got a number of franchises that have material scale and we only expect them to be growing and this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms we made the decision on asia pac and emea to exit the markets where we didnt believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business so that we can focus our firepower in those areas where were either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward us consumer is an obvious example of that so i think as we youll hear from us going forward more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this aided by the transformation program or in the areas where well be investing to attain greater scale and as i say us consumer is the obvious one there are pockets in citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 commercial bank were excited by securities services is one where we think it is very readily attainable particularly given our pre and post trade capabilities and part of that scale finally will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity that will also provide us scale so collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong operator your next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning jane and mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just a followup understand youre being deliberately in strategy leading up to i guess the investor day you mentioned next first quarter next year but as we think about just the investment spend and the expense outlook handicap mark if you could the risk that we could see a little bit of an expense creep as you dig further deeper into this both in terms of your guidance for midsingle digit expense growth this year and as we think about just the duration of that investment cycle over the next few years mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look again this is something that we control right so again i want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise and its the right thing to do right so were going to continue to do that in terms of kind of risk to it i dont think there are any surprises here right if revenues come in meaningfully different theres a certain component of our expense base thats tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around but aside from those volumerelated expenses transaction compensation et cetera you should expect what ive guided towards in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and were going to continue to do that if we see more investment opportunities in or were going to go after them because again we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work operator your next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning mark good morning jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark you said something interesting about the investment banking business revenues i think you said that they were or higher than or lower i dont ive got to check oh higher im checking my notes here so your business is still nicely above the levels and we came through a period up until the pandemic that youre well aware of that it was somewhat challenging the growth in investment banking and trading businesses as you look forward when you talk to your people in investment banking and in global markets where do they see this because there seems to be an elevated amount of business due to what we just came through in the last months do they think its sustainable or do we get back to a what are those guys telling you about the next to months in those businesses mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah id start by saying we continue to have very very good dialogue with our clients across the franchise and specifically in investment banking and if you think about it many businesses many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model and think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic everything from how to think about digitization how to think about going direct to consumers what the pandemic means for supply chains how people work remotely how they manage their liquidity levels what to do with that excess liquidity should they be buying or what and so were part of that dialogue which is incredibly representative i think it represents strongly the franchise that we have the general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the goforward environment yes theres some things to kind of manage to but theres a general level of optimism and so what i represented relative to is while we are seeing normalization were normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in and wed expect continued momentum and wed expect to continue to take share over time jane anything you want to add to that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark i think you covered it very well theres a high level of client engagement with us at the moment really around the world and a lot of demand were seeing in addition to the investment banking side this shift to ecommerce with clients needing our tts services our crossborder flows were seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to tick up nicely the commercial banking side is another area that were seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that were supporting them through our treasury services and the like so i think theres a general sense of optimism we have a fabulous pipeline one never wants to jinx these things but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 operator your next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im going to ask my question here and then requeue the real question is just on capital i mean youre not blind to the fact that your tangible book value is and your stock price is so we should probably be selling your desk chairs and your silverware and anything you can to buy back your stock i would think so along those lines the first question is when youre looking at these sales of assets consumer markets do you expect to have a gain on those or a loss on those relative to where theyre marked currently mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look i mean i think id tell you mike that we as jane mentioned weve seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets and theres no surprise just given we think those are good businesses just not of scale as jane mentioned for us weve got to run that process through and see what that results in and ill continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials but im not going to sit here and tell you whether its gains or losses or what it means specifically for those markets what i will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions well continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital first looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks dividends et cetera and weve been disciplined about that to date and were going to continue to be disciplined about that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so to clarify if i got this right your cet1 ratio is and your return on capital above so if you were to quantify the dollar amount of that how much would that mean in potential buybacks at this point and then i assume that would not include any capital freed up from any sale so you could have potential to buy back a lot of stock if you were willing and able is that correct mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc theres a little bit over billion of excess capital between the and the and so thats what that equates to operator your next and final question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please proceed vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions a couple mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning mark any comments on promotional trends that youre seeing in card pricing given everybody is back focusing on the business you mentioned marketing spend but can you talk a little about what youre seeing in promotional pricing in that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i guess what id say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated we are legging back into bringing on new card customers and so and what were seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre covid precrisis or prepandemic levels and frankly were seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on and as has always been the case its going to be a mix in terms of the acquisition strategy but thus far were seeing normal behaviors if you will and look the new account acquisitions skew towards branded cards and theyre in products that are less reliant on the offers and products like flex pay and flex loan which will generate interest immediately as those balances grow operator we do have one more question in queue from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi an unrelated question just jane as you think about the technology approach doing it yourself through citigroup and pairing up with partners whats the status of the relationship with google and google plex and your desire to use thirdparties to gather new customers at lower initial cost but maybe not as much lifetime value if you think of that tradeoff whats your current thinking today and we havent heard much about the google relationship despite some initial headlines thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah hey there mike excellent question the partnership with big tech is an important part of our disrupter strategy in the us as were looking at both how do we enhance value propositions to customers the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving and i think theres no question that covid has accelerated the embedded finance model in the us just think of the travel ecosystem think of home improvement ecosystems the benefit weve got is that for us its not a new space to us weve been very much engaged with partners in asia grab paytm and webank as well as our traditional partners what we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot because its still early days in the development of these new ecosystems we learn a lot about marketing about user experiences around the tech stacks its certainly enables us to tap into next generation customer bases but also importantly it goes beyond consumer and so if we look on the corporate side our partnership with stripe the work that were doing in tts with project spring of enabling payments around is a core piece particularly as wholesale and retail kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one so with a google plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the states and elsewhere in the world were very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of apis and partner integration capabilities so that were citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2021 able to integrate other partners into our offerings develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves and citi plex with google is an example of that we are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment well be finalizing dates well share that with you when available but its one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us but far from the only one here in the states to help us disrupt and grow going forward operator we do have a followup question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi sorry but i kind of have a second question and thats on capital given that youre headed towards a higher gsib bucket mark jane what youre all thinking in terms of that in terms of not just capital targets anything you can do about that because i know thats a year a little over a year away from going into effect but obviously youre thinking about target capital well have to keep in mind whats coming down the pipe for you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure and look as you know with all of the liquidity in the market many of us have seen pressure on our gsib score that certainly has been the case for us and it wouldnt go into effect the higher gsib score of until the beginning of and we look at the entire capital stack holistically the target in our case which is well above reg minimums but certainly does consider that in it and there are elements of that as i mentioned earlier that we can influence and control so the stress capital buffer is part of that and i talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the fed models we know we can influence ppnr we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately what stress losses come out of it and so we will continue to manage that we will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher gsib score and as you know regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system and theyll continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well including gsib and balance sheet size et cetera and well see how that evolves but again we feel good about where we are were well capitalized we have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us and we intend to again invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders operator i would now like to turn
