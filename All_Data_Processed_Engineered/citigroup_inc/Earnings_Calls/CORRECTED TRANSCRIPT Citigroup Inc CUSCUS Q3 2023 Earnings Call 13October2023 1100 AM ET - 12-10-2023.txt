jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and good morning to everyone i shall touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last months organizational announcement the global macro backdrop remains a story of desynchronization in the us recent data implies a soft landing but history would suggest otherwise and we are seeing some cracks in the lowerfico consumers in the euro area and the uk the picture has turned distinctly more negative the summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading south and the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs suggests a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region chinas economy may have reached a cyclical bottom supported by the governments modest stimulus efforts but it still has to work through weak sentiment youth unemployment and the pain in its property market all of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment september is always a busy month seeing clients and im struck how consistently ceos are less optimistic about than a few months ago the shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity however corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and are building redundancy and resiliency and this plays to our strength and strategy in particular our invaluable global network and between our high quality asset portfolio our strong reserve levels our ample liquidity and our diversified earnings base we are proving to our clients that we are truly a bank for all seasons citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 turning to the quarter today we reported net income of billion and eps of and an rotce of our revenues were up ex divestitures and each of our five core interconnected businesses posted revenue growth we remain on track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year lets start with our fastestgrowing business services tts was up from a year ago thats the highest revenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at investor day half of that growth was business drivers and the other half rates and even with the impact of the longexpected argentine devaluation we again drove fee growth which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise we keep relentlessly innovating for our clients amongst other launches this quarter we announced the creation of citi token services which we use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our tts clients and this is a first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permission tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as dollar clearing securities services had revenue growth of with some good underlying fee growth we took share again and we have grown our auc and aua by over trillion in the last year this business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefiting from the cloud and data investments we are making markets was up yearoveryear on the back of rates and currencies having the best third quarter in years and commodities which also grew nicely this was partially offset by equities which was down slightly despite this we continue to see good momentum in cash and we have grown our prime balances yeartodate banking had a good quarter with revenues up with activity playing to our mix now while corporate lending was essentially flat as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet dcm was healthier and the ipo market also showed some signs of life this helped drive investment banking revenue up albeit off a low base and a small wallet sitting here today it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound still im proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year as you know were committed to growing our banking franchise we brought together the management of the investment corporate and commercial banks under one umbrella and this structure will help us better drive the important synergies between all three weve been bringing in new talent in key sectors and weve begun to provide more leveraged finance for key clients in the right situations us personal banking was also up doubledigits up cards revenues were strong in both our branded and retail services portfolios the growth in spending is decelerating and the consumer is more mindful what they spend on indeed the affluent who still have excess savings at their disposal drove the growth in spending with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment during the quarter we introduced simplified banking to improve the client experience for our retail banking clients we believe that by tiering offerings and simplifying our fee structure were going to incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us and the early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly most notably investment revenues picked up across our geographies and the drivers of the franchise such as referrals client acquisition and net new inflows were all quite strong around the world and we won important new mandates for wealth at work an offering we had highlighted at investor day citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 andy sieg has now officially joined our firm this is a time of massive global wealth creation and our franchise is uniquely positioned for it andy will ensure were at the forefront of whats happening around the world in terms of our balance sheet our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past five years we grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong aided by our disciplined client selection our cet1 ratio grew to which is billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a bp internal management buffer during the quarter we returned billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks we continue to evaluate buybacks quarter by quarter and i expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter subject to approval by our board and while the ultimate impact of potentially higher capital requirements wont be known until the basel iii endgame is finalized we have been actively working through mitigating actions as you can see on slide we are relentless in executing our strategy this quarter we closed on the sale of our taiwan consumer business and thats the second largest of the asia consumer divestitures and earlier this week we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in china to hsbc and this includes approximately billion in assets under management and billion of deposits in the fourth quarter we expect to close on the sale of our indonesia consumer business in terms of the international consumer businesses were exiting in addition to the three winddown markets weve restarted the sales process in poland and we remain on track to separate mexico next year followed by an ipo in transformation remains our number one priority were deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes consolidating fragmented tech platforms and upgrading our data architecture were committed to doing this the right way knowing it will take time to meet our regulators expectations and to deliver a modern more efficient infrastructure last month we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank i said at investor day that organizational simplification would follow the divestitures the changes will eliminate layers duplication and complexity allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results so to bring it to life the actions weve taken in the last four weeks will eliminate over of the regional and functional roles of the top two layers of the company it also will take out committees which frees up over tens of thousands of people hours annually weve identified approximately or of our internal financial management reports that we wont need any longer and we have taken out coheads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decisionmaking were cascading these changes through the organization at pace we announced the first two layers in september and the next set of changes will be implemented by midnovember and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year when we speak in january mark and i will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics showing the impact of the simplification amongst other details now while expenses is not the primary driver of the organizational changes they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year and at citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 the end of the work we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster better serve our clients and unlock value for our shareholders weve made tough decisions here and i want to note how pleased ive been with how the leaders of the firm especially the next generation have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them they fully understand that we need to change how we run citi in order to truly transform it once and for all before i close id like to address our people in israel we are a significant bank in the country and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones others are being called up to serve despite all theyre dealing with they are keeping our bank running in the country and im frankly in all of their commitment to our clients and each other more broadly the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness and with that i would like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons for the third quarter unless i indicate otherwise and then spend a little more time on the businesses on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the third quarter we reported net income of approximately billion eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results are divestiturerelated impacts of approximately million aftertax primarily driven by the taiwan consumer business sale excluding these items eps was with an rotce of in the quarter total revenues increased by on a reported basis and excluding divestiturerelated impacts driven by strength across services cards and markets as well as modest growth in banking partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and winddowns our results include expenses of billion up on a reported basis and billion excluding divestiture related costs also up cost of credit was approximately billion up primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and volume growth at the end of the quarter we had over billion in total reserves with a reservetofunded loan ratio of approximately and yeartodate we reported an rotce of on slide we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes expenses were up and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors including investments in transformation as well as risk and controls businessled and enterpriseled investments macro factors including inflation and fx severance which was approximately million in the quarter and roughly million on a yeartodate basis this included actions across banking markets wealth and the functions and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and winddowns and our technology spend across the firm was billion in the quarter up largely driven by investments in product development platform enhancements and improving the client experience also driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm as we said last quarter our transformation in technology investments span the following themes platform and process simplification security and infrastructure modernization client experience enhancements and data citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 improvements and we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly billion excluding divestiture related impacts and the fdic special assessment on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans where ill speak to sequential variances in the third quarter net interest income decreased by million excluding markets net interest income increased million primarily driven by growth in pbwm as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads a pickup in services driven by higher deposit spreads as a result of higher interest rates and active data management partially offset by reductions from closed exits and winddowns average loans were up largely driven by growth in us personal banking across cards and retail banking as well as tts average deposits were down largely driven by services as we saw nonoperational deposit outflows as expected in light of quantitative tightening and our net interest margin increased basis point on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics we are wellreserved for the current environment with over billion of total reserves our reservestofunded loan ratio is nearly and within that us cards is in pbwm of our loans are in us cards and of that exposure is to customers with fico scores of or higher and both branded cards and retail services ncl rates are still below pre covid levels but are normalizing in line with our expectations the remaining of our pbwm loans are largely in wealth predominantly in mortgages and margin lending in our icg portfolio of our total exposure approximately is investment grade of the international exposure approximately is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries corporate non accrual loans increased by million but remain low at basis points of total corporate loans and we ended the quarter with a reservetofunded loan ratio of approximately as you can see on the page we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across icg and pbwm which totals approximately billion of which is investment grade with a total reservetofunded loan ratio of to give you a sense of the macro scenarios that underpin our over billion of reserves our current scenario weighted average unemployment rate is approximately which includes a downside scenario with an average unemployment rate of roughly so while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintain a very strong trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a welldiversified trillion deposit base across regions industries customers and account types which is deployed into highquality diversified assets our balance sheet reflects our strategy and welldiversified business model we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates financial institutions investors and individuals with global needs the majority of our deposits billion are institutional and operational in nature and span across countries these institutional deposits are complemented by billion of us personal banking and global wealth deposits we have approximately billion of hqla and approximately billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of billion citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 our lcr was we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio based on standardized rwa which is our binding constraint although not binding our advanced rwa did increase this quarter largely driven by business activity and our tangible book value per share was up from a year ago on slide we show a sequential cet1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter starting from the end of the second quarter first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction of about basis points and finally the remaining 2basispoint increase was primarily driven by lower dta deductions and a net reduction in rwa we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points or billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of as of october before we move on id like to spend a minute on capital we continue to optimize our rwa and capital which we expect to be a tailwind over time contributing to this is the execution of our strategy such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model including exiting our international consumer markets our investments in the transformation will continue to enhance our data analytics and stress testing capabilities enabling continued capital optimization and of course in light of the evolving regulatory environment were also looking at other mitigating actions but those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play out these actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products divesting certain equity investments and reevaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer weve consistently demonstrated our ability to manage our rwa and capital levels through various macro environments and the evolving regulatory landscape and well continue to do so on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group for the third quarter revenues were up this quarter driven by doubledigit growth across services markets and banking in the quarter normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in icg on an exfx basis icg revenues would have been up additionally there was an approximately million negative impact from the currency devaluation in argentina on our net investment in the country mainly across tts markets and securities services expenses increased primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volumerelated expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was million including million of net credit losses this resulted in net income of approximately billion up driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit average loans were down as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses including the reduction in subscription credit facilities average deposits were flat as new client acquisition and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by nonoperational deposit outflows icg delivered an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day in treasury and trade solutions we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income noninterest revenues were up and on an exfx basis noninterest revenues would have been up we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in tts that indicate consistently strong client activity with crossborder flows up outpacing global gdp growth and yeartodate crossborder flows were up us dollar clearing volumes are up both yearoveryear in the quarter and yeartodate citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 and commercial card volumes were up yearoveryear driven by growth in businesstobusiness payments and travel and entertainment spend and yeartodate commercial card volumes were up in fact similar to the last few quarters client wins are up approximately across all client segments these include marquee mandates where we are serving as the clients primary operating bank we continue to make good progress on our commercial client strategy as yeartodate wins more than doubled driven by expansion into new markets and growth in multiproduct mandates from clients with crossborder needs in securities services revenues were up driven by higher net interest income across currencies non interest revenues were up were very pleased with the progress were seeing in securities services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately or trillion markets revenues were up driven by fixed income fixed income revenues were up largely driven by strength in our rates and currencies franchise while volatility remains subdued versus a year ago we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter equities revenues were down driven by a decline in equity derivatives partially offset by growth in cash and prime and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to rwa target and finally banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were up driven by investment banking which increased on a reported basis and excluding marks here too we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter particularly in dcm but also in ma as we closed a few deals earlier than expected so overall while the market environment remains challenging and theres more work to be done were making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management business revenues were up driven by net interest income growth of and a increase in noninterest revenue primarily due to lower partner payments in retail services and higher investment product revenues in wealth expenses were up predominantly driven by risk and control investments and severance partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was billion driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios average loans increased driven by cards mortgages and installment lending average deposits decreased largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform and pbwm delivered an rotce of and on a yeartodate basis on slide we show pbwm revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics this quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of doubledigit growth in personal banking driven by cards branded cards revenues were up primarily driven by higher net interest income we continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up card spend volumes up and average loans up retail services revenues were up driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses in the card portfolios we continue to see the investments weve been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interestearning balances of in branded cards and in retail services citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 retail banking revenues decreased driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business partially offset by higher deposit spreads wealth revenues were up driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments the benefit from relationships transferred from retail banking and higher lending revenue we also saw strong net new inflows across all regions and yeartodate new client acquisitions were up almost in the private bank and over in wealth at work overall we are pleased with the progress were making across these businesses on slide we show results for legacy franchises revenues were down largely driven by the difference in onetime gain on sale impacts in the asia consumer businesses as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and winddowns partially offset by higher revenue in mexico its worth noting that mexicos revenues were up primarily driven by mexican peso appreciation higher interest rates and volume growth exfx mexico revenues were up expenses decreased primarily driven by closed consumer exits and winddowns partially offset by separation costs in mexico and mexican peso appreciation and expenses in mexico were up but exfx expenses were up on slide we show results for corporateother revenues increased largely driven by the absence of markto market impacts on certain derivative transaction in the prior year and expenses decreased largely driven by lower consulting fees on slide ill briefly touch on our full year outlook with one quarter remaining in the year we continue to expect fullyear revenues of billion to billion excluding divestiturerelated impacts having said that based on what weve seen play out yeartodate in terms of us and nonus rates and lagging nonus betas we now expect net interest income to be slightly above billion for the full year excluding markets and we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly billion excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the fdic special assessment net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize with both portfolios reaching precovid levels by year end and as it relates to buybacks we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter before we move to qa id like to end with a few points were executing on our strategy and delivering topline revenue growth of yeartodate we continue to invest for the long term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver our expense guidance were focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure which will further support our speed of execution were managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our rotce target of to in the medium term and again we look forward to hosting a more expansive fourth quarter earnings call when we plan to share additional details related to the organizational simplification including expected related severance and expense saves as well as our outlook for with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jane you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently the real question is why is this restructuring different than the other or or restructurings weve heard about since citis creation in its current form years ago i think just like a week ago so id say why is this different we hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification reducing dual heads and the committees but weve heard this so much that why is this time different jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah its a very important question mike thank you for asking it as ive said we view these as the most consequential changes weve made not just to our organization model but how we run the bank in almost two decades and the first piece is simple which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket that is simply not the bank we are today so were aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy but whats truly different is were changing how we run the bank and these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization so let me give you some examples to bring it to life we told you about delayering the first two or three layers of the bank that will continue through the organization through the spans and layers particularly getting rid of aggregator roles and let me give you an example hr we had hr in a region you had the region head you had the institutional client group head you had the banking head in addition you had a north asia head and a south asia head were just going to have the north asia head and the south asia head and all of those roles collapse into those two were eliminating activities in the geographies that we just dont need anymore because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them so lets take the financial reporting sorry the management reporting that mark and i referred to in the opening remarks we can reduce our management reports by about thats reports what does that mean shadow pls by country quarterly outlooks monthly performance updates all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow pl rather than the one that matters to our shareholders and so that greatly declutters it also means we can eliminate processes for our transformation where we are looking at how do we automate those processes automate those controls if theyre a duplicative process were getting rid of them so we dont need to do that anymore and it will accelerate the work on transformation were taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them a lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business we move that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scale economies these strategy teams marketing teams many of the little cottage industries that build up over time citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 we can speed up decisionmaking with fewer committee layers well take down the number of layers and drive that from places were looking to getting to in as many places as we possibly can were giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one so much more single points of accountability again more aligned with our shareholder interests because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products and the types of metrics were looking at to help us measure this spans layers revenues reduces the non producer grade mixes synergies that were realizing voice of the client but id say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what were trying to drive here our strength is our global network i dont want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of whats happening in the product organization i want them focused on delivering to our clients engaging with our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities the same way for our banking organization putting the investment bank the corporate bank and commercial bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them so the crosssell or the movement of a commercial midmarket company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company much easier when theyre all in the same organization or selling banking products suite into that commercial bank customer and other examples so its really changing decisionmaking freeing up people to focus on clients and transformation much greater transparency changing decisionmaking and rights driving synergies we put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work that is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through the second and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter so its very different youll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call but i hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different this is how were running the place its not just an org restructuring both are necessary operator and our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc so im curious you mentioned that youre still marching towards the which is good because everyone was going to ask that my question is a little bit different of with the denominator going up wheres in other words a lot of things are working towards your transformation but theres sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by so you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure and you also mentioned youre working on mitigation as we speak so maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we dont see that give you confidence still working towards that because the top line stuffs is working mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so let me good morning glenn its good to hear from you let me make a couple comments on that and then jane feel free to chime in if youd like the first thing is that when i talked about this at the last conference we attended i mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the to range in terms of a citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 capital increase and were likely to be inside of that range assuming the basel iii proposal as its structured as its written and obviously thats not the final theres a period of review thats going on now what id say is a couple things glenn one we havent fully executed against the strategy that jane has just described and obviously continuing to simplify the business managing through the transformation changing that business mix that we have to something thats more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to ppnr those things matter and impact the scb we talked about the exiting of our businesses the international consumer businesses that will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base which we know is an important factor in that ppnr math as well and so those things help i think to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium term period importantly as you point out there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final so think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in scb as something of a point of advocacy but thats obviously a big headwind that well have to kind of work through the frtb and the enhancement of models now theres a global market shock as well but again another point of advocacy that we need to work through the equity investments and now that they go from risk weighting to risk weighting i think were going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them thats going to challenge the returns thats going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens and were going to do that and thats not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments for example and so as weve done with saccr and other types of reg changes were going to have to look at what it means for our product mix the returns associated with those whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing or whether we have to take other decisions around those and so thats what i mean by the mitigating actions that were dimensioning and putting on paper and working through but again want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that i mentioned already operator and our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc youve talked a lot about defense as i like to call it in terms of the transformation that jane had outlined and bending the expense curve but im wondering for jane and mark if you could sort of address what i think is probably the most debated part of your target which is that revenue cagr of you put up a very nice quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 in terms of revenues both net interest income and fees and maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of whats really going well i think tts continues to surprise to the upside are we going to be two years from now were like oh well tts is continuing doing well so what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being underrecognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer and what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that rotce target jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i love this question erika because i am really i have to say im really excited about our strategy and the potential it has and it is as you say this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it so theres a couple of unstoppable trends that were going to be riding in the next i think its decadelong the corporate client of today and indeed consumer has to build resiliency the multinational client is on a longterm trend of building resiliency be it because of green be it because of geopolitics be it because of regulatory whatever the different reasons may be and there are multiple theyre having to build resiliency into supply chains into their own operations as they operate around the world where the bank is absolutely there for them and i think youve seen that in tts where weve had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend so that is an important one wherever the clients want to go we are there we have been there for decades we understand the risk we understand the client base we understand the opportunities there at that that micro level and local levels that someone who is flying in with a suitcase cant possibly deliver and its connected globally so this thing is just a thing of beauty linked into it is what i think of as an hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is securities services it equally in custody has this extraordinary global network the connectivity everywhere we have been investing behind this business weve been growing our market share in north america in asset managers where weve been underweight with a number of material marquee wins you can see the share gain that were getting in this business the pipeline of deals that weve already won as well as the new pipelines going forward very high return were investing both in terms of our cloud our data our client experience and i this is in a way lets say i do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile fee profile and other dimensions to it weve quite a long way to run here so similar story to tts slightly different client base competitively advantaged because youve got both the youve got the pretrade and the posttrade we connect the two huge efficiencies for clients thats going to matter next trend thats unstoppable global wealth creation and there is just going to be massive global wealth creation i cant tell you how excited andy sieg is now that hes in the building and knows the way to his desk and all the floors his people are on hes about to hit the road globally we are so well positioned to deliver against that and as you can see weve not been happy with our performance the last couple of years but this is going to be a very important driver for us citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 well see the recovery in banking wallet eventually none of us are calling when that will sustainably happen that will be another driver and id say cards continuing to go from strength to strength particularly i think as we look forward playing to our lendingled model there and finally the other one i do love which is our commercial bank we serve these entrepreneurs all over the world who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward and were serving them helping them go international for the first step tap them into global supply chains and the like its almost by definition the fastest growing of the midmarket companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them we build great relationships with them and then our private bankers calling on them and then our investment bankers calling on them we have our capital market teams calling on them and we help them grow and succeed and that is going to be a big engine in the medium term of new client acquisition feeding us so deeper client relationships more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on and well keep investing to make sure that were where areas were behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we are crushing it in like our win rate is in tts and were going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way so sorry to be so excited about this but i this is a the to just feels very very doable to mark and i operator and our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning mark maybe on the revenue discussion there lets talk about nii a little bit you guys have a very unique deposit base a lot smaller footprint in low cost consumer betas have been already been high so it doesnt seem like theres as much beta catchup risk for you its nonus roughly how do you think about the trajectory of nii as we do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts how do we think about the puts and takes on your nii into next year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks for the question look im not going to give guidance for well do that obviously at the fourth quarter earnings but i think its reasonable to expect that some of the trends that weve seen so far will continue so if you think about whats underneath this well continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies i think well continue to see benefits from card interestearning balance growth recall that when you look at our us dollar ire position its relatively neutral at this point and interestearning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates and so i think whats important to remember as it relates to our business is that its global that weve got while youre right in that on the us dollar side weve seen betas kind of reach particularly for our corporate clients reach terminal levels at the end of last year on the nonus dollar side betas run lower they lag and theres still upside there because its a different rate curve and a different pace of increases and so those will be some of the puts and takes to think about volumes the rates the speed of the curve moves and then how betas evolve that will kind of factor in and then the final thing to remember is that in our nii we show it both with and without markets on the ex markets well have the impact of the drag from the exits of the countries that kind of play out so we just exited citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 taiwan thats going to impact obviously the next quarters nii so just a couple of factors to think about and obviously ill give you more detail on at the fourth quarter earnings call operator and our next question comes from ryan kenny with morgan stanley ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc on the capital markets side i heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound can you just give us an update or more color on how ceos are thinking about bringing deals live across ma ecm and dcm and does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well i think a couple pieces i actually start with  is the seventh quarter of the current ib downturn so since downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because thats often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities and were starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets investment grade market where the expectation of no longer how high but how long for rates weve seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that we still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet plays out when you talk to ceos is largely dependent on the macro environment and thats the main piece for them ecm were seeing increased interest and activity on ecm you obviously had several ipos coming to market in september big ones three big ones that were involved in but the markets still somewhat fragile were watching it closely and quite a few questions in  things may move to  we just have to see how that unfolds but theres a good pipeline i mean theres a lot of pentup demand here in debt we had a big pickup in dcm we feel confident that the gradual recovery in dcm and the beginnings of that lev fin one will continue youre certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right situations for our key clients and then in ma a healthy ma sell side pipeline a lot of companies with their industries is transforming are really wanting to think big i think well see that unlocking when sentiment improves further companies do accept the new pricing reality which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets that obviously from our end takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product so its there but i think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro no one is going to make that call as to when were going to see that sustainable term in banking at this point citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 operator and our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so mark i recognize and jane i do recognize youll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter but one of the things i was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your head count trends and prior to covid as well as the consent order mind you citi was running with direct staff that number is closer to today its an increase of even with multiple divestitures that youve consummated so how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of head count for citi versus that precovid baseline of and whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such head count actions mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look im not going to give you head count guidance but what i will say is jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway and obviously as we continue to progress in those divestitures weve made a lot of progress already well see those heads come down its also important to point out that as part of our effort theres been insourcing and so weve captured the extended workforce in the head count that we have here and then i think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the transformation work and as we implement the org simplification that weve just announced undoubtedly the technology investment the automation that were putting in place the straightthrough processing that occurs the fewer reconciliations that are required the streamlining from all of those layers that jane mentioned well be eliminating all of those things will also work to reduce head count as well and so while were investing and hiring on the frontend to capture the upside as markets turn but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients were also going to realize efficiencies that come out of head count reduction one additional point is that youve heard me mention before that weve taken probably about million or so yeartodate in repositioning charges and with that will come roughly or so head count coming down associated with those repositioning charges and so and well continue to do that by the way we havent even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification thats underway that will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year and so we will see heads continue to evolve through this process but keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in source versus use external parties citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 operator operator instructions and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning just maybe mark following up on that as we think about bending the curve through the end of next year maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in legacy versus pbwm and icg like just how do you break how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well look next year we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter and as we think about that youll have some of the benefits of the cost going away from the exits that we would have announced you have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded cost which weve been keenly focused on as weve exited each of these and then i think as we get to the medium term you will start to see some of the benefits from the transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base but again thats in that mediumterm period so all of those things will be drivers to getting to bending of the curve i havent broken down im not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces but all are important factors to achieving them operator and our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi there were some quotes i think in the media jane from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer and i appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing its not a huge percent of the card portfolio but could you elaborate on that and then also just address the you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans it is kind of a little disproportionate i think spend is up a couple percent yearoveryear and the loans are so as we think about being kind of latercycle is that something that youre paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah look i think most of the pressure in the lower fico we dont have a lot of customers in lower fico so were seeing it out in the market weve got we obviously have some in the retail services business we also i would say have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because were having to reserve fully for that but we get it back on the revenue line as you know but as we look at the indiscernible book as we look at some of the pressures in the market as we look at spending we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower fico whereas when i think about the cards business its very much driven by the affluent customer so the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that were seeing and thats similar for the numbers that we saw from coming out of the fed citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 from the deposit side the excess savings are sitting there now primarily with households with over of income and its down in the rest so these are things were keeping an eye on i want to be very clear im not that worried about it for citi given the prime nature of our card portfolio and then the rest of our pbwm exposure is obviously very is very affluent but when i look out at the market i talked to our corporate clients thats where we tend to see them being more nervous about the softness in the consumer and just i call it theyre much more mindful about where theyre spending right so youre seeing them moving down within the category theyre certainly looking more on the bargain front weve been hearing that from our retail partners weve been hearing that across the board so growth of card loans is good our spend is up but less than loans i think its softening but its not worrying mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think thats spot on jane the only thing id add is that when you look at the payment rates payment rates in branded cards while theyve started to come down theyre still above the precovid level and we obviously have invested in this business so the other thing thats driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth but again theres nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing operator and our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jane good morning mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jane as youve pointed out youre very excited about the opportunities in tts youre winning some new mandates in the custody business can you feel on this is it because the competition is struggling with other issues what gives you because citi has always been wellregarded in this area so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think the added excitement is a lot of its coming from the investments that weve been making so that we are if you look at it in terms of payment express which is live in the us its thailand is on track for three more markets that is really a very differentiating capability the momentum we have in clearing thats been citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 put in place weve had over billion processed yeartodate putting our commercial bank clients onto citidirect so they have seamless access to our whole tts network globally you heard us talking about citi token services you can see us innovating with the fed in new capabilities so really across the board its that innovation in cuttingedge firstinthemarket type of capabilities but youre putting that on top of a network thats just unprecedented in terms of its presence its local capabilities its payroll cash management liquidity management its collections its receivables all sitting on one platform connected globally and what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves insights on data what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities i mean this thing is a thing of beauty and its very very hard its very sticky to extricate from this because its embedded into how our clients do business its that critical and into their technology systems so when you look at where the worlds headed and whats going on in the world volatility these other elements its hard not to see opportunities and its opportunities as well with our markets business linked in one of our really differentiating factors that andy morton talks about all the time is his partnership with tts the fact that one of our major client bases are corporates and they have a different profile lets say to an asset manager or a hedge fund and we uniquely can serve them so thats the piece its that combination in trends we see mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing i think thats spot on jane the only thing id add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us as you said earlier leveraging that tts platform and then on the securities services side the reality is that were finally seeing real traction in north america right weve always had kind of strength in many of the other regions but were really winning some major mandates here in north america which i think is enough to get really excited about jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i think that to me is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what were trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings better earnings mix and other pieces that will help us get to that mediumterm return target that we are so focused on operator and our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jane hi mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit so jane i heard you say that youre keeping north asia and south asia heads so did you just get rid of the asia head and get rid of the product heads where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head so is that that dotted line is no longer there or whats going on there and when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting what are you planning to replace that with from your management your mis perspective jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so let me take the second one first im not planning on replacing it with anything we dont need them were no longer running consumer franchises in the countries instead weve got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies so we just dont need to replace them and it enables us just to have the legal entity financial management that we need and then our internal reports get greatly simplified same as they get greatly simplified by taking out icg and pbwm is another eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports so the wonderful answer is nothing a simpler citi the first question was about okay help you understand what weve done so on the geography front we have done two main things already one is weve put weve eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me so that makes it much simpler for me i have one international head and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively the second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries and secondly the legal entity management and otherwise before we had a huge amount of management on shadow pls and different a lot of very heavy committee structure that was necessary because the business was still very local as a retail bank a local credit card business a local onshore wealth business theyve gone its just serving multinationals the subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets and thats a much simpler business to manage so we could get rid of the regional layer and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today they too have less of a mandate than they had before a much more focused one and the bit that im excited about is not just yes this makes it much simpler to manage but it also helps us really focus on the global network now our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base and theyre in one team to do it it just makes it much easier does that give you a feel what else mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the other thing vivek that i think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting right because as jane talked about we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments so looking at that pl looking at those returns looking at that growth opportunity through that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and around the on the other piece that i think is also just an important point globalization is changing and were seeing these lanes all changing through trade financial flows et cetera by actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters north and south asia europe uk latam middle east africa the connection points between them are really changing at the moment and so this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because i think its much more in line with how the world is operating today operator and our next question comes from saul martinez with hsbc saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi there so i wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses and you guys have i guess your guidance is implying that branded cards and retail services get back to more normalized levels by year end which is a decentsized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter so i kind of want to know whats driving that view but more importantly i guess what does that imply going forward and does it imply that we get to more something more like above trend losses because i would think we still have some seasoning to go on the late and vintages and not only that were talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor markets so if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether theres maybe a little bit more risk than were thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally or what are more normalized levels mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes so let me start on that and then jane if you want to chime in thats fine i think what id point you to is page in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending and you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so and so at on branded cards and on retail services we can see that were likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year getting up to the to to precovid normalized ncl rates our expectation is that as we go into to the point that youve made depending on the macro environment were likely to see this tick up above those precovid normalized rates as we see a slowdown in the economy again subject to what the macro looks like before then kind of settling down at some point down the path and so yes we do see that tick up this is again as advertised so to speak as we would have expected and we have reserves significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations so in branded cards we sit with an acl to loan reserve of and retail services we have jane mentioned earlier that the losses in retail services citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 ultimately get shared with partners and so while we would expect this to normalize and mature so to speak we feel very wellreserved for what that might look like jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and our portfolio is very prime i mean this is not the old citi its very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure and i think what youre hearing from us is this should all be very manageable mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc were not theres no alarm bells going off at citi around this were being prudent were being conservative around pieces and responsible on it but theres no alarm bells ringing and i think that there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how were feeling were just not seeing the data that is overly concerning its manageable this is all very manageable and were being prudent about it as youd expect us to be operator and our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the followup from your initial answer jane i hear you with the restructuring deconstructing citi to global lines delayering of management and decluttering reporting and when you add it all together well get some numbers in january but as it relates to your return targets and efficiency targets for and consensus is about onethird below what you target and frankly i have not spoken to one investor who thinks youre going to get those targets and maybe you would want to revise those lower in some way or maybe to be determined or whats your degree of conviction of getting to those targets or at least getting above your cost of capital thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah look we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets weve got you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that weve got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that were in control of and that weve been investing behind to achieve so our strategy is unchanged were confident it would drive the revenue growth of to its not the primary purpose but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that weve talked about and i would also say that when you look at revenue expenses and the targets weve laid out at investor day weve certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro regulatory geopolitics in the last couple of years we have delivered on what we said we would do in the revenue in the expense guidance on the strategy weve made adaptions along the way as weve needed to but i think thats the piece that were also really trying to drive into the firm as a culture of we will do what we say we will do and well adapt accordingly to different areas citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements depending what they are we have other levers that we can pull capital allocation management buffer dta but my message to our investors is were just building a proof point this is a relentless execution look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there weve achieved a lot and there is a lot going on and were getting a lot done we dont pretend were at the end of the road there were there yet but were getting done what we said wed do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets anything to add mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc as you said building credibility and being transparent jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc right so were going to keep delivering on the proof points and were going to be transparent about how and when and how were going to achieve it so operator and our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you mark you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising and as a percentage of loans theyre still very low i was just curious on the corporate loans in north america there was an uptick again i know relative to the portfolio its not that big but anything in particular you can share with us in that area mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc on the corporate loans we saw loss i think losses were million in the quarter so a small amount we did see an uptick as you point out in the reserves that was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made and then we did see an increase in the nals the nonaccrual loans and that was really one or two names and one in north america one in emea both of them are current but they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there operator and there are no further questions in the queue i will turn the call over to jenn landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you all for joining us if you have any followup questions please contact ir thank you operator this concludes the citis third quarter
