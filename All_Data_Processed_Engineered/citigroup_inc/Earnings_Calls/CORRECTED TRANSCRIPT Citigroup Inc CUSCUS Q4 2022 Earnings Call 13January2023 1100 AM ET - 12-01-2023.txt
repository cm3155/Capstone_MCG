questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time ms landis you may begin jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser president chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and happy new year to everyone joining us today we are very much off and running as we start today ill share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter and then i shall take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in and our strategic priorities for the coming year the global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year as we enter the environment is a tad better than we all expected for the time being at least despite the aggressive tightening by central banks in europe a warmer december reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak that said we still expect softening of economic conditions across the eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with in asia while the public health impacts in china are unfortunately likely to be severe the abrupt end of covid zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally and here at home the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings the fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation however and therefore we continue to see the us entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year now turning to how we performed for the fourth quarter we reported net income of billion and eps of our full year revenue growth of exdivestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at investor day as was the case with our expenses we delivered an rotce of nearly and a cet1 ratio of citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 this quarter our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year and were quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well and were seeing good momentum in us personal banking on the flipside investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one unpacking that a bit services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both treasury and trade solutions and securities services tts the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up yearoveryear as we executed on the strategy we laid out at the investor day thanks to strong business drivers coupled with higher rates tts is performing ahead of our expectations likewise securities services was up a strong we ended the year having onboarded trillion of new assets under administration and custody markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory with revenues up from we had the numberone ficc franchise on the street during the first three quarters of the year and fixed income was up in the final quarter equities was down as the mix of client activity again did not play to our strengths in derivatives with the wallet down significantly our investment banking revenues were off by about this quarter while the pipeline looks more promising and client sentiment is improving it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in wealth managements performance was disappointing revenues were down in the quarter with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and aum globally but most acutely in asia however we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows similarly we continue to build our client advisor base albeit at a slower pace given this environment we would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover in us personal banking both cards businesses had doubledigit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly whilst in retail banking we clearly have some more work to do as you know weve been actively managing our balance sheet and risk our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance we built reserves in personal banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession and in the us net credit losses in cards continued to normalize as we had expected still well below precovid levels corporate credit remained healthy and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio in terms of capital we increased the cet1 ratio by about basis points to during the fourth quarter and finally our tangible book value per share increased to and we returned billion to our shareholders through our common dividends now let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in one of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create longterm value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground im pleased with the significant progress weve already made citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 we simplified the bank closing the sales of our consumer businesses in five markets including three in the fourth quarter and we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in korea as well as our franchise in russia we continued to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank were streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data this will make us a better bank we brought in very strong talent met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment to that end im pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year we also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the us finally im very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks which defined and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout before i hand over to mark lets turn to the next few years and in particular the path to achieving our medium term return targets that we laid out on page at investor day we talked about the path coming in three phases with phase characterized by both disciplined execution and investments is a continuation of phase laying the foundation for driving longterm shareholder value were focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out competitively stronger services enters with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovations and marketleading product capabilities markets to continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focus on capital productivity banking and wealth are wellpositioned for when this cycle turns thanks to the investments weve made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise as you saw we felt this was the right time to make a change in wealth and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business i asked jim odonnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm this will leverage his deep expertise in relationship and when combined with sunil gargs additional role as north america head is designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market us personal banking will continue to benefit from the recovery in borrowing taking full advantage of our market leading digital platforms and new products particularly in the card space we will make further progress on our international consumer exits enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base and we will of course focus on our clients deepening relationships and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy we will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise including the investments in our transformation and controls however we will pay some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment looking further out we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our mediumterm targets well do so through a combination of our divestitures realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification and mark will cover this in more detail shortly we fully recognize this suppresses our citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 returns in the near term but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our mediumterm return targets and to create longterm shareholder value we are carrying not just our momentum but our determination into despite the macro headwinds we are very much on track to reach the mediumterm return targets we shared with you on investor day we intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments we are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way with that id like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone we have a lot to cover on todays call im going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons unless i indicate otherwise ill also discuss our progress against our mediumterm kpi targets and end with our guidance for on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the fourth quarter we reported net income of approximately billion and an eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenue embedded in these results are pretax divestiturerelated impacts of approximately million largely driven by gains on divestitures excluding these items eps was with an rotce of approximately in the quarter total revenues increased by or excluding divestiturerelated impacts as strength across services markets and us personal banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits our results include expenses of billion a decrease of versus the prior year excluding divestiturerelated costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year expenses increased by largely driven by investments in our transformation businessled investments and higher volumerelated expenses partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exits cost of credit was approximately billion primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses particularly in retail services and an acl build of million largely related to growth in card and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and on a full year basis we delivered billion of net income and an rotce audio gap now turning to the full year revenue walk on slide in we reported revenue of approximately billion up excluding the impact of divestitures in line with our guidance of lowsingle digit growth treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by continued benefits from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments client wins have accelerated due to the investments that weve been making in marketleading product capabilities these products include the first us dollar clearing capability in the industry the sevenday cash sweep product that we launched earlier this year and instant payments which is live in markets reaching over countries so while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year business action and investments drove the remaining half citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 in securities services revenues grew as net interest income grew driven by higher interest rates across currencies partially offset by a decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations for the full year we onboarded approximately trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in markets we grew revenues mainly driven by strength in rates and fx as we continued to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital this was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives on the flip side banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity in cards we grew revenues as we continued to see benefits from the investments that we made in along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels and in wealth revenues were down largely driven by market valuations and china lockdowns excluding asia revenues were up corporateother also benefited from higher nii in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher shortterm rates and as you can see on the slide in legacy franchises excluding divestiturerelated impacts revenues decreased by about billion as we closed five of the exit markets and continued to wind down russia and korea consumer going forward we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit markets on slide we show an expense loss for the full year with the key underlying drivers in excluding divestiturerelated impacts expenses were up roughly in line with our guidance transformation grew with about twothirds of the increase related to risk control data and finance programs and approximately of the investments in those programs are related to technology about of the expense increase was driven by businessled investments which include improving and adding scalability to our tts and securities services platform enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities we also continued to invest in frontoffice talent albeit at a more measured pace given the environment and volumerelated expenses were up largely driven by markets and cards the remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation these expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market across the firm technologyrelated expenses increased by this year on slide we show our results versus the mediumterm kpi targets that we laid out at investor day which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way macro factors and market conditions including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didnt anticipate at investor day impacted some kpis positively and others negatively however we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy in tts we continued to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we roll out new product offerings and invest in the client experience which is a key part of our strategy citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 client wins are up approximately across all segments and these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the clients primary operating bank for the third quarter year to date we estimate that we gained about basis points of share and maintained our number one position with large institutional clients in addition weve onboarded over suppliers this year helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape and in securities services we on boarded new client assets which offset some of the decline in market valuations and we estimate that weve gained about basis points of share in securities services through the third quarter of this year including in our home market in markets weve strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to rwa part in cards loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services cards spend volumes were up end of period loans up and most importantly interest earning balances up that said in areas like investment banking we lost share this year but maintained our market position and in wealth while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets given the impact of market valuations this didnt translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point so in summary we made good progress against our mediumterm kpi targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since investor day this highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the mediumterm now turning back to the fourth quarter on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans in the fourth quarter net interest income increased by approximately million on a sequential basis largely driven by services cards and markets average loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in icg and legacy franchises excluding foreign exchange translation loans were flat and average deposits were down by approximately largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation excluding foreign exchange translation deposits were up sequentially average deposits were up driven by growth in icg and pbwm and our net interest margin increased by basis points on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit mix we are well reserved for the current environment with over billion of reserves our reservestofunded loan ratio is approximately and within that pbwm and us cards is and respectively both just above day one cecl levels and we feel very good about the highquality nature of our portfolio in pbwm of our lending exposures are in us cards and of that branded cards makes up and retail services makes up additionally just over of our total card exposure is to prime customers and ncl rates continue to be well below precovid levels in our icg portfolio of our total exposure over is investment grade of the international exposure approximately is investment grade for exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries and corporate nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with prepandemic levels at about basis points of total loans that said we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of scenarios so while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality exposures and reserve levels citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics we maintain a very strong balance sheet of our trillion balance sheet about a quarter or just under billion consist of hqla and we maintain audio gap and our tangible book value per share was up from a year ago on slide we show a sequential cet1 wall to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters walking from the end of the third quarter first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends which drove a reduction of about basis points third the impact on aoci through our afs investment portfolio drove an basis point increase and finally the remaining basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits rwa optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points higher than the last quarter as you can see we hit our cet1 target which includes a basis point internal management buffer that will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients and as it relates to buybacks this quarter we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarterbyquarter on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group for the fourth quarter revenues increased by this quarter with tts up on continued strength in nii securities services revenues up markets revenue up on strength in fixed income partially offset by a decline in equity and investment banking revenues down which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume expenses increased driven by transformation businessled investments specifically in services and volume related expenses partially offset by fx translation and productivity savings cost of credit was million driven by net credit losses of million partially offset by an acl release this resulted in net income of approximately billion down driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses icg delivered a rotce for the quarter and average loans were down slightly largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts excluding fx loans were up average deposits were roughly flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation deposits were up and sequentially deposits were up as for the full year icg grew revenues by to billion and delivered approximately billion of net income with an rotce of now turning to slide we show the results of our personal banking and wealth management business revenues were up as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services expenses were up driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives cost of credit was billion which included a reserve build driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions ncls were up reflecting ongoing normalization particularly in retail services average loans increased while average deposits decreased largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform and pbwm delivered an rotce of driven by the acl build this quarter and higher expenses for the full year pbwm delivered an rotce of on billion in revenue on slide we show results for legacy franchises revenues decreased primarily driven by the closing of five exit markets as well as the impact of the winddown expenses decreased largely driven by the absence of divestiturerelated impacts last year related to korea citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 on slide we show results for corporate other for the fourth quarter revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses on slide we summarize our guidance for as jane mentioned earlier is a continuation of phase we will continue to execute and invest laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving longterm shareholder value with that as a backdrop we expect revenue to be in the range of billion to billion excluding any potential divestiturerelated impacts expenses to be roughly billion also excluding divestiturerelated impacts net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize and as we said earlier we met our cet1 target and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next dfast cycle and close additional exits and announce others on slide on the right side of the page we show our revenue for and and our expectations for excluding the impact of divestitures in we expect the revenue growth i just mentioned to be driven by nii and nir in tts we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace driven by interest rates and business actions and for securities services we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuations and onboarding of additional client assets we also assume somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in china end and market valuations start to rebound and we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity as for markets we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in now turning to the nii guidance for we expect both icg and pbwm to contribute to nii growth as we grow volume particularly in cards and we continue to get the benefit of us and nonus rate hikes in our services businesses as a reminder the guidance for revenue includes a reduction of revenue from the exits in legacy franchises that we closed in and we expect to close this year in turning to slide in the increase in expenses that i just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that weve made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy and the main drivers are first transformation as we continue to invest in data risk and controls and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient second businessled investments as we execute against our strategy third volumerelated expenses in line with our revenue expectations and fourth elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exits and we are investing in technology across the firm with total technologyrelated expenses increasing by while we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses these are investments that we have to make and i am certain that these investments will make us a better more efficient company in the future and finally lets talk a little bit about the mediumterm targets at investor day we said the mediumterm was three to five years that timeframe represented to so while a lot has changed in the macro environment since investor day our strategy has not and we are on a path to the to rotce target in the mediumterm we continue to expect top line revenue growth material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our mediumterm cet1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our to rotce target citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 so let me walk you through where we stand today from a revenue perspective rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe which accelerated nii growth and that coupled with the execution of our strategy has allowed certain business to accelerate at the same time other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed despite this consistent with investor day we expect a to revenue cagr in the mediumterm including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit from an expense perspective as we showed at investor day expenses will need to normalize over the medium term and we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of the three main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exits which will be included in legacy franchises the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure first let me remind you at this point the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately billion of the billion roughly billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year the remaining billion relates to potentially stranded costs and winddown which takes time to eliminate second as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes to technologyenabled ones and finally we will remain focused on simplifying the organization and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reductions in the future from a credit perspective we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future acl builds or releases will be a function of macro assumptions and volumes so to wrap up while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted we remain on our path to achieve the to rotce in the mediumterm and jane the rest of the firm and i are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress with that jane and i will be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question will come from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks so much and definitely appreciate all these outlook slides theyre very helpful and my so my question on the outlook is if you take a look at the current mediumsize return on tangibles and getting to your target i heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track is it the expense spend at the end of that is the material stepup from here to there if you will andor is credit like a really big determinant in the process im trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from todays return on tangible to the target thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure good morning glenn thanks for the question so we did give you some guidance here we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for and then importantly when we talk about the medium term its both the continued revenue growth the to cagr that i referenced but its also bringing the expenses down from this forecast and i mentioned in the prepared remarks the drivers of whats going to bring these expenses down the combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring if you will in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for and so its the combination of revenue growth expense bending of that curve and coming down the cost of credit is kind of as weve been talking about for some time now which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what weve seen kind of prior to this covid cycle that weve been managing through glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that thank you just one quick followup and totally its not my norm but i normally try to respect this type of process but mark we consider you a super important part of this transformation theres been news out there about you talking to one of my other companies but would you be able to make any comments you mentioned your commitment staying on sorry to put you on the spot but i think a lot of people care mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i appreciate that glenn and citi is an important firm im the cfo of this firm and this strategy is something that im focused on with jane ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that create shareholder value for our investors and so were committed to getting that done jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc together citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc together operator thank you our next question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is now open john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey mark i wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for youve got about the midpoint it kind of implies about a revenue growth this year kind of consistent with what you talked about for that to so for this year the guide it looks like the nii is guided to be up about and the markets youre assuming kind of flat so whats enabling you to get to the where are the drivers that are above is it some of those fee businesses and just a little more color there will be helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so let me make a comment first on the nii just keep in mind with that number that ive given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year but also expected continue increases particularly outside of the us and given the makeup of our franchise we will that will contribute to the nii growth and then keep in mind that were growing over the legacy franchise reductions in nii that we would see in so underneath that is some real momentum in the nii notwithstanding a slower pace the fact that it will be a slower pace than what we saw in from an nir point of view i did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation and that would play out both in banking normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while its down to and as well as some normalization in wealth and those would hit the nir line as you point out john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then sorry if this is clear already but just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of is that going to mean that for the early part of expenses kind of rise above and then they kind of peak out plateau towards the back half of is that how we should envision it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc im not going to kind of get into guidance well kind of get through and im confident about our ability to get to that roughly billion number that i put out for im equally confident that we will bend this curve and well bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the rotce target but im not going to kind of get into john the specifics of except to say that by the end of we will see that curve bending operator thank you our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is again thank you for all the clarification on the slides great job jen and tom and mark obviously but as we think about what it means to bend the curve i think your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation as we think about when citi can hit that medium term rotce how should we think about whats bending the curve really means and im not looking for guidance necessarily but as we think about going past that hump whats a better way of measuring should we is it an efficiency ratio i think you mentioned something like is it the to efficiency ratio against that to revenue cagr that you think youll be able to hit by should we think of it that way mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so at investor day we did talk about it and we remain consistent and committed to that we talked about getting to an efficiency ratio thats less than in the mediumterm period and so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down i think the other thing id mention just you mentioned the how and i think there are a couple of important aspects to that the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away at least a portion of it is the portion thats tied to stranded costs jane has been very very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operation i think the third piece is that technology right and so right now a lot of what were doing is manual and as we continue to invest in technology and technologys up pretty significantly this year or so we expect it to be up next year that technology buildout if you will will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity and that will bring down the operational costs for running the firm and so those are a couple of examples i hope of the how but i think importantly you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at investor day jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i would say you can get some confidence indiscernible around the path on many of these by the urgency with which were executing the divestitures for example getting those transactions closed and weve also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be actually will be closing and the speed of the winddowns that were executing so that will help as mark said its three big structural drivers of what will bend that curve citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and mark im sorry for misspeaking i was looking at the wrong borrowing efficiency i have like slides open on my computer mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thats okay erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc the second question and maybe this is to you jane i think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to the divestitures i think the elephant in the room continues to be i think investors sort of expected an announcement on banamex right now and im wondering if youre still considering just selling banamex or are you thinking about different options on the table such as an ipo jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc so were in active dialog at the moment so im obviously not going to comment in great detail here we do continue to pursue a dual path as youd expect because both are very viable options here and when we are in a position to give you clarity we will do so i think weve been fairly clear about the timing we are also separating out the two franchises our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that were selling because we see the institutional franchise as a very important part of the global network as you can imagine in todays environment mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains and we play a very important role there that is a lot of work in that separation im extremely pleased with the progress that were making in that underlying work but we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce we will be delighted to do so operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im still trying to get over this revenue and expense guidance so youre implying youll have at a minimum flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for am i reading that correctly so on the one hand youre not bending the cost curve until late on the other hand youre guiding for positive operating leverage in am i reading that correctly mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah mike when you do the math i dont think itll get to positive operating leverage in but we are as you see on the slide targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line that growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that billion number would roughly billion number would suggest but we are on the right track and we are getting there in a way thats consistent with the strategy that we talked about and we do feel citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that weve put out here similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then a second followup or a followup and then ill requeue with my other questions your cet1 ratio is now and i think thats two quarters earlier than consensus had expected you said it was up basis points so doesnt that allow you to repurchase stock now or i understand that if you go ahead and sell banamex that could have a temporary negative capital hit so im just thinking like dont sell banamex dont have that temporary capital hit start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value so whats wrong with my logic or what part of that could you comment on jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc im going to jump in on the dont sell banamex mike as you could imagine so were selling the consumer franchise it does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in investor day its an emerging market consumer franchise and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and highnet worth individuals with crossborder needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity across the between each other so we are we dont see banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective and when we run all the math it is in the shareholders interests that we sell that franchise and flow that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns so what youre suggesting is a very shortterm move and i think as you can see from the actions we are taking were very focused on our medium and longterm and not taking the shortterm path that we would regret in the medium and longterm operator thank you our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just one question a followup on capital as we think about post the second half of the year lets say youve taken the hit from banamex but coming out of this stress test any sense mark if theres any reason why citi would have an outsized negative impact from the basel end game reforms just give us a sense im just wondering hopefully we dont get another disappointment as we get our hopes high for the buybacks in the back citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 half and is there something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank would love any perspective there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look as we pointed out weve built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year we are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year we do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that cet1 ratio and we do obviously have a dfast thats in front of us that well have to see what the outcome is of that work i think the basel end game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding and i think well have to take those into consideration when they become available that is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out and similar to indiscernible well get after it in a very significant way to make sure that were able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that but it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there arent final rules out just yet ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just back to your mediumterm targets i guess if you hit that the bending the curve at the end of it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of by even at the lower end of the guidance am i missing anything there or like does that make sense mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id point out is what weve described what ive described or janes described is the mediumterm is through and weve given you guidance for we intend to get to those return targets in the mediumterm i havent given you specific guidance on any of those individual years and well kind of take that yearbyyear and so just factor in i think whats important is youve got a view on and i think weve given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that mediumterm and i think thats important operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey betsy citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with personal and wealth management i know jane earlier you talked about the fact that which you have announced looking for a new head to move that business forward could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth because theres a bunch of different pieces some on the advice channel some on the more fee channel some on the more balance sheet piece and you already indicated us as an opportunity to expand into so id just like to understand from your perspective which pieces are the most important to execute on and that could help us understand how youre planning on shaping this business going forward thank you jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc great question betsy and mark and i are both smiling here because i think the answer is all of the above so if we break it down where do we see the various elements of upside theres an important recovery thats going to occur in asia and you can see from our results last year and across the board with other competitors with an asian bent that was materially impacted by covid in china and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of covid in that market compared to broadly in asia compared to the us so we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in asia across the board youre absolutely right in the us we start from a smaller scale there weve been bringing different parts of that business together the wealth at work franchise is one thats had particularly pleasing growth in it and weve also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers the biggest upside there is investment products i think weve got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were particularly deposits from the margin lending and the like mortgages but this is really about the investment offering in this space then finally id say theres also tremendous opportunity in the synergies and weve been showing you this in terms of linkages between our commercial banks our banking franchise the referrals up from the us personal banking weve had about referrals this year in the us alone from that markets also provides important referrals and even tts so the client referrals there are business synergies between them common platforms so we really see an opportunity for this multidimensional growth drivers in wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from and well continue investing in appropriately in building out that front line as well so this is a very important part of our strategy were excited about it its a key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well looking at the medium term and were looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here or youve already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think look at in this current environment were as weve mark and i have both said since really the middle of this year this is something that were pacing but were continuing to invest behind and you can see that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 growth in our client advisors and remember that net growth in client advisors includes the divestiture we made in uruguay for example so its pretty strong we dont have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place and its more been a story of integrating them and then making sure that were putting the right digital and other investments behind it but its not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business and well pace that as appropriate with market conditions mark anything to add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc one thing id add betsy you know this this is in the normal part of the cycle this is a high margin high returning business and weve seen that in the past and so we want to be wellpositioned for as the market turns having brought on client advisors having brought in new clients through client acquisitions which are up in and so i think were wellpositioned for that but as jane mentioned given where we are we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars and so well repace as necessary but ensure that were ready for when things turn jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc and id just add it was a couple of years ago that we put that we announced the strategy and started executing on it so we have the benefit of the historic investments that were seeing the drivers playing out well and as i say well we should be wellpositioned when the market turns here operator thank you our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i just want to follow up on the comments about expecting markets to be relatively flat in obviously a very good and i know at least i was concerned about some of the rwa management and ficc in recent quarters and i think proved that not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue but as you think about like the wallets have been strong in recent years and to your point your ficc leadership was strong this year how confident are you in kind of that flat markets and maybe whats driving that view thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc its a markets business right and so you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets business with that said weve got a very very strong ficc franchise we had a very good year a very good year this year i think were wellpositioned with the client base and were wellpositioned to maintain our number one position as we go into now how that market and market wallet moves i think is going to predicate on a number of things including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like but again i feel like were wellpositioned to hold our position if not gain more share as that plays out citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 and so i think flat relative to a year that weve had up as significantly as it is a reasonable call based on what we know now jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah weve also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc equity derivatives for example was a real strength this was an equity derivatives year so this and the corporate worlds with the volatility thats out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours and for better or for worse were expecting that strength to continue it certainly seems to so far matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning or afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good afternoon jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc mark maybe just digging into nii a little bit if you look at annualized you have a decent stepdown but when you take a look at your deposit franchise your mix of business versus your peers where theyre seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the us pricing thats going to hurt second half nii if we look at you guys you already have high betas mostly institutional you mentioned the benefit from nonus rates and youre growing deposits so why sort of the a similar trend in nii versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on just trying to think that through because it doesnt look like the legacy drag is very big in your chart mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc similar dynamics you say in or youre talking about the fourth quarter im not sure i follow you citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc im just trying to talk about versus peers some have guided similarly to down from annualized run rates but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth benefits from nonus rates and a much higher beta mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so i think i mean i think id point to a couple of things on the nii side just as it relates to us one importantly that i mentioned and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits weve got about or so are in icg and the balance in our pbwm business we certainly skew to us dollar but weve got a or so that is in nonus dollar and when i think about the potential or lookforward curves or how rates will likely move next year we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the nonus side right and so if i think about our international presence the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the us with our corporate client segment and so i think theres some repricing opportunities that well continue to actively manage as we did here in the us and so i do think its that international footprint the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in the other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view and that volume growth youve seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in interestearning balances and wed expect that to continue particularly as we see ncls normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper and so i think those things will be two major contributors mix is obviously a factor as you point out we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from legacy but its that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios that i think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that i talked about jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no thats all fair but i guess maybe i didnt phrase my question right but if i look at exmarkets i think your forecast for sic would be less than the run rate exmarkets and yet you just mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah but again i think i mean jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc shared a bunch mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry finish your question im sorry citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc well just you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise so im just trying to get a sense of whats driving the decline from levels mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think the thing youve got to pick up is really the legacy franchise and the nii a large part of the legacy franchise revenues are nii revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there and so i think thats the important element here that we havent quantified to a dollar amount but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter obviously theres other factors but thats important operator thank you our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi mark hi jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good afternoon jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us on your comments regarding and this is true for your peers as well the normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses so when you look at branded cards or retail sales or retail services how do you see that progressing through one of your peers pointed out that they think by the end of they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers but im just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah but let me jump in and then ill hand it on to mark but i think we are expecting under the current trajectory to see the loss rates to reach the precovid levels more at the yearend early level if you think of branded cards if i was to quantify ph its sort of of of the way there now crs were about of the way there now obviously we have the benefit in crs of sharing the loss sharing with our partners that helps us but i hope that gives you a sense around it citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 probably the most important driver that weve been worried about was very uncertain with what was happening with payment rates and i think weve got much more clarity ph because theyve started that normalization path so thats driving a fair amount of more certainty around what the direction is happening there frankly the big question is more whats happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now is the bigger uncertainty but gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc mark any other observations mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add is that gerard you could see just depending on how this plays out you could see kind of ncl rates tick up above normal levels gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and then come back down to normal levels has been the timeline that jane described again just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out but again we as we sit here and talk about these ncl rates its important to point out as well that were very well reserved across all of these portfolios and so to some extent if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside the ncls kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established but the trend line is exactly as jane described just recognizing that you could see a tick up above normal levels and then it come back down jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc also this is such an unusual market in the sense that youve got such strong labor market driven by frankly a supply shortage almost as much as demand and weve also got the consumers with still very high savings that theyre dipping into and were seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this but this is not going to be like a normal recession its why youre thinking here us and others talking about the manageability and the mildness of it likely if we do have one gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and what kind of unemployment rates are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory is it we get to unemployment by first quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think a couple of things so one our basecase scenario if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it just and as we forecasted it the downside would be something a bit more severe than that id say were reserved for approximately a unemployment rate just kind of overall when you look at when you average across the different scenarios that we have operator thank you our next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks just two quick questions here the first one just on card the card nim has been kind of flattish i know that obviously has to do with just how you show how you internally allocate the funding towards it but can you just kind of talk us through whats happening either with rewards or either incremental teaser rates on some of the new relationships and should we see the card nim expand from here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah im not going to get into ken kind of guidance on nim what i will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the card side weve made very good traction and jane you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with american and weve also launched a number of new products that i think is helping to fuel the growth that weve seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that weve seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interestearning balance and loan growth that weve seen but i really dont want to get into the nim guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i mean we have a fabulous cards franchise and when we look at strong track record in the digital the other innovations that are driving growth driving the profitability driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as with our partners and were really seeing all of those drivers performing very very strongly at the moment from custom cash that was of new accounts acquisitions so an important new product refresh thats driving things of customers engaging digitally innovations like american is a fantastic partner of ours really taking that to the next levels and you can see that with the growth in spend in the category so i think theres a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the returns and the margins and the other trajectories here and as i say a prime portfolio which is always a good thing ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks and my second question was there was an article about changing management up in the wealth management business this week and i just wonder if you can talk about that but also just about the progress that youre making inside the wealth management relative to your the kpis and the goals that youve discussed at analysts day thanks citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah sure i mean two years ago i asked jim odonnell to put the wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm and now as we move to the next phase for this as weve said this strategically important business i believe its the right time to change the leadership also because jims going to play an important role moving forward supporting paco with the icg strategy that we laid out at investor day hes got a lot of relationships with investors family offices private equity sovereign wealth funds and hes going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firms full capabilities to these clients so i felt the time was right to make the move and we will be as indicated swiftly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business and in the meantime its business as usual as we go out and follow the strategy that we have and were looking forward to the market turning as im sure everyone is and feel that were wellpositioned to do so operator thank you our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon this is actually sharon leung filling in for steven just on the topic of credit one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental billion or so of reserves if they assume unemployment under cecl can you just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the base based on your macro outlook and potential growth math headwinds mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thank you why dont i take that im not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you or here on the fly what i will say is that as we build these reserves we are building them against three scenarios that base scenario that i mentioned the downside scenario and upside scenario and we weight both scenarios and the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession and in that baseline unemployment was call it or so in terms of the unemployment assumption we also had a downside scenario unemployment in the downside scenario got to a or so and then we had an upside scenario the weighted average across the quarters was about the that i mentioned and those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the quarter and largely when you think about the weightings we put on those scenarios the weightings skewed towards that base and that downside the reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business pbwm and specifically around cards and that really had to do the change quarteroverquarter with the change in hpi but what i would say is that it also reflects as i mentioned earlier a cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are wellbelow what they would be in a normal cycle and it does pick up the fact that theres volume growth that we saw in the quarter there so im not going to kind of run scenarios for you but hopefully that gives you some perspective as to whats underneath the models that weve used to establish these reserves and obviously we do that on a quarterby quarter basis citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc id also just jump in on one of the areas that sometimes gets misthought of about the firm is on the corporate credit side mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah a good point jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc when we look at our corporate client portfolio dont equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint when i look internationally of our international exposure are with multinational firms and their subsidiaries and this is investment grade so i think thats another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio as you saw with russia and others we will be conservative in the reserving we take but i think its important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful thanks and then as a followup it seems like a part of our revenue targets for depends on some improvement in the environment for example stabilizing equity markets ib rebound and jane you also noted that the mediumterm targets are designed to be achievable in different environments so if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment right because you could have i dont anticipate this but you could have continued pressure in investment banking but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the markets business so there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out i think whats really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them and so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year it can vary from whats here thats what gives us the confidence to around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that weve talked about and really push execution and thats exactly what were doing jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc and an important part of is not just the impact of the cycle but also youll see the impact of the different investments that weve been making and youve certainly seen that for example in services this year and weve been very transparent around the basis point increase weve seen in wallet share in the months leading up to the third quarter and so youve not only got drivers here in terms of whats happening in the market but youve also got the strategic drivers also taking in more and more together as mark referred to the synergies citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc its a great point jane because it may not always show up in the top line jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc which is why we put those kpis out there theyre often indicators of some of the upside thats on the come as the market evolves operator thank you our last question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc hello again mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi yeah so one question one followup so you have a your slide says you have a cet1 target of by midyear but youre already there so and i guess if we go back to the banamex thing i guess is that kind of assuming potential capital impacts from divestitures or why would you have a target six months out when youve already met it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah mike i have to tell you im surprised that youre asking about mexico just given our history together but i understand it and what i jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc what i would say is that a couple of things one we clearly see where we trade right and were not happy about where we trade and we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today so if we could buy back right if we could do buybacks as soon as were able to do buybacks we will right i mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders the second thing i would say is we did get to the sooner and that was again in accordance with executing against our strategy and parts of our business particularly the markets business has done a really good job at citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to rwa and weve been able to get there without damaging the franchise which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business particularly in fixed income whats ahead of us as you rightfully pointed out is that weve got a number of exits that have to take place there are puts and takes across many of them but mexico in particular will have a temporary temporary impact on our cet1 ratio and so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next two quarters so that we can absorb that and we also want to make sure that were positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always but certainly over the next couple of quarters while we manage the headwind temporary headwind from that exit so hopefully that gives you a better sense for it but were actively managing this and we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders jane nind fraser a president chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i want to reiterate that as well i mean its very important to us and as mark says we know where we trade weve made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders interests in compensation and management interest all these various dimensions and we just want to make sure that we hit what we say were going to do and continue delivering against what we say were going to be delivering and with the cta impact essentially in mexico we want to make sure that were taking that into account mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thats very clear and then lastly your nii guide excluding marketsrelated is higher for but i think that implies a little stepdown from the fourth quarter level not as much as jpmorgan was guiding down for the fourth quarter level i was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from you being outside the us what are some of the ins and outs there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so youve got a couple of points here so one is we wont see nii momentum as weve seen in just as betas start to increase on the icg side and get to terminal levels thats obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into but some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year and so thatll be a plus in youll also see as i mentioned earlier some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the us and given our mix that will benefit us in and then therell be volume will contribute to that nii growth particularly as we continue to see good momentum which we anticipate on the cards side the offset will be that the legacy franchises right and so as those exits occur as the winddowns continue as i mentioned earlier that revenue mix does skew towards nii and so well have to grow over that and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that weve set so those are the puts and takes operator thank you there are no further questions i will now turn the call over to jen landis for closing remarks citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 jennifer landis headinvestor relations
