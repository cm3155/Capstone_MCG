citigroup inc  the bank plans to have one day each week when workers can avoid being oncamera for internal calls we are all feeling the weariness citis chief executive said happy hours and casual fridays team doughnuts and coffee trips have all fallen by the wayside in the last year as one office tradition after another was curtailed by the reality of remote work lawyers rolled into court from bed executives used one good shirt sweatpants ruled the day but citigroup one of the worlds largest banks is trying to start a new endofweek tradition zoomfree fridays the banks new chief executive jane fraser announced the plan for zoomfree fridays in a memo sent to employees on monday recognizing that workers have spent inordinate amounts of the past months staring at video calls citi is encouraging its employees to take a step back from zoom and other videoconferencing platforms for one day a week she said the blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our wellbeing ms fraser wrote in the memo which was seen by the new york times after listening to colleagues around the world it became apparent we need to combat the zoom fatigue that many of us feel she wrote the memo said that no one at the company would have to turn their video on for any internal meetings on fridays external meetings would not be affected there still will be client and regulator meetings that need to happen via zoom it said citi the third largest bank in america and the 13th largest globally by assets according to sp global also asked its workers around the world to make sure they take their vacation time and designated friday may a companywide holiday for all workers to be off and reset the bank outlined other steps to restore some semblance of worklife balance it recommended employees stop scheduling calls outside of traditional working hours and pledged that when employees can return to offices a majority of its workers would be given the option to work from home up to two days a week we are all feeling the weariness wrote ms fraser who took up her role as citis chief executive this month and is the first woman to lead a major american bank the pressure is high for citi to turn itself around after a bankers mistake sent nearly billion wired to the wrong people and the bank was handed a million fine by federal regulators last year over longrunning problems but complaints of zoom fatigue have emerged across industries and classrooms in the past year as people confined to working from home faced schedules packed with virtual meetings and found that their hours of oncamera work were often followed up by long video catchups with friends the widespread feeling of burnout prompted research from stanford university trying to explain why video calls felt so draining in a peerreviewed article published in the journal technology mind and behavior last month professor jeremy bailenson the founding director of the stanford virtual human interaction lab outlined several reasons video calls can be so much more exhausting than inperson conversations he found that the excessive eye contact involved in video calls the unnatural situation of seeing ourselves onscreen and having to stay in the same fixed spot all contribute toward zoom fatigue video calls are also harder mental work for us professor bailenson said in a news release because we have to put in more effort to make and interpret nonverbal communications if you want to show someone that you are agreeing with them you have to do an exaggerated nod or put your thumbs up he said that adds cognitive load as youre using mental calories in order to communicate dr aaron balick a psychotherapist and the author of the psychodynamics of social networking said a key mistake companies made when setting up workfromhome conditions last year was to treat zoom calls as the equivalent of facetoface meetings he said that they failed to consider the additional mental burden placed on workers and the downtime needed to process what was said between calls they require different intellectual muscles dr balick said in an interview on wednesday adding that zoom calls needed to be treated as a functionally different thing citis zoomfree fridays have the right spirit behind them he said though he added if youre doing backtoback zooms monday through thursday and then have a day off friday thats still not quite good enough employees need more opportunities to block out uninterrupted time to work without the distractions of calls and meetings he said without the structure and routine of office life many people have also fallen into the trap of working longer hours because they have no external cue telling them when to switch off he added research has found that the stresses of the pandemic and increased workloads have meant some employees could be working as much as two hours a day more than usual for wall street which even before the pandemic had a notorious reputation for extreme hours citis efforts to introduce a more flexible approach to work will probably not go unnoticed last week a survey of firstyear goldman sachs analysts drew attention on social media with the analysts claiming they worked an average of around hours a week and felt they were victims of workplace abuse goldman responded in a statement that a year into covid people are understandably quite stretched it said it was listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them citis chief said she wanted to cut the zoom fatigue that many of us feel photograph by kena betancuragence francepresse getty images when citigroup inc last year sent almost million to lenders in error it not only set off a legal fight over the money but unwittingly highlighted a separate issue in the back office the frequently clunky experience of using business software the mistaken payment at citi occurred as workers tried to send a nearly million interest payment using a financial software product called flexcube which is offered by a subsidiary of oracle corp citi has blamed the mistake on human error an oracle spokeswoman said financial institutions use flexcube to safely make trillions of dollars in transactions every day in the ensuing litigation as citi tried to recoup the money the bank shared images from its software the screenshots showed a user interface with dense type low contrast and small buttons and boxes it is the kind of design that would make executives at consumerfacing companies cringe including banks offering brightly lit and easytouse apps to their checking savings and creditcard customers designers and analysts said but it hardly stands out in a business environment they said while people look for bestinclass user experiences as consumers they are often forced to check those kinds of expectations at the office door that is partly because the people who choose business software for their companies rarely consider user experience said sam horodezky founder of strathearn design a userexperience consulting firm they will frequently pick the product with the most features or the lowest cost without factoring in the end user at all he said it can also be costly to change or update business software and might require retraining employees mr horodezky added the flexcube screenshot reflects an older customized version of its business software the oracle spokeswoman said the screenshots shown in court do not reflect the current user interface of oracles corporatelending systems she said there are also key differences between personal payments and corporate lending the oracle spokeswoman said these lending systems are built for trained users who have to consider multiple complex scenarios and fields and is not just a money transfer from one person to another she said no two commercial loans are structured the same way as they might be in consumer lending said paul spiteri chief executive of the lending practice a commercial lending consulting firm it is hard to encapsulate technology and processes around something that doesnt look the same twice he said the good news for workers squinting at dimly lit designs is that the consumer sector is putting pressure on businesses to provide better digital experiences for both clients and employees according to software executives theyre having an influx of users who are demanding easier simpler more modern experiences said todd olson chief executive of pendoio inc a productengagement software company that offers services such as user onboarding and training however while changing relatively obvious elements in the user interface can help that doesnt always address deeper problems he said companies might need to analyze how long users are spending on certain forms or where they pause for example to understand which changes to make companies are beginning to invest in making products easier to use but their efforts are still relatively nascent said andrew hogan principal analyst at forrester research inc a research firm theyre paying interest on the design debt mr hogan said of companies that dont make ease of use a priority this is an area thats going to see huge investment over the next few years the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital practices in business software said lidiane jones executive vice president and general manager of salesforce commerce cloud part of business software provider salesforcecom inc technologies such as personalization and artificial intelligence commonly used in consumer products are starting to become capabilities that businesssoftware users want she said after the overpayment snafu last august citi said it is in the process of upgrading its loanoperations platform we have put significant additional controls in place until the new system is operational it said then on jane frasers desk at citigroups downtown manhattan headquarters sits a map of puerto rico made from trees downed by hurricane maria which devastated the island in for ms fraser the incoming chief executive of citi the

of the banks latin america business ms fraser oversaw efforts to provide bank employees with generators solar cellphone chargers portable septic systems water and other basic necessities at lightning speed allowing them to reopen the branch a week after the storm we were the only bank that was up and running she said in an interview that allowed companies like shell walmart and other big citi clients to restart operations as well the map was a thankyou gift from the banks puerto rico employees we dont leave a country when its in really bad shape ms fraser said in fact she said turmoil in a country makes the banks purpose there clearer we can really make a difference ms fraser learned this as she steered the bank through economic crises in venezuela and argentina and worked to clean up its mexican subsidiary which was reeling from a moneylaundering scandal when she took over the latin america region in her skills attitude and global perspective will come in handy as she turns her attention to what could be one of the biggest cleanup jobs of her career citigroup itself in march she will take the chief executive reins from michael corbat it is a major turnaround job ever since the financial crisis when citi required a billion government bailout and had to split itself into separate operating units to survive the sprawling institution has been limping along in third place among the four biggest us banks underwhelming its investors and irritating regulators who in october imposed a wideranging directive to get itself in shape citi also agreed to pay a million fine the bank had longstanding problems regulators said from failing to catch money launderers to ineffective risk management citis other mistakes included failing to tell minority customers seeking mortgages that they were eligible for lower interest rates if they had other business with the bank it spent million in compensating customers to remedy that regulators also found that the bank had for at least six years failed to follow a federal law requiring that lenders ensure owners of buildings vulnerable to flooding had insurance if the buildings were used as collateral just before regulators acted in october citi accidentally wired million to the wrong people an embarrassing scandal that landed it in court the bank with trillion in assets continues to be profitable in january citi reported a profit of billion on revenue of billion but both its revenue and its earnings were lower than a year earlier as credit card users reduced their activity its share price has languished falling roughly percent in the past year while a broader index of banking stocks the kbw nasdaq bank index has remained flat ms fraser whose appointment to the top job was announced in october will become the first
