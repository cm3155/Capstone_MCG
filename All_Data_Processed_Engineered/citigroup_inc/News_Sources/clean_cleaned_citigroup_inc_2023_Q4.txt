a female employee of citigroup recently sued the bank accusing its leadership of tolerating a work culture in which she was sexually harassed and abused by male executives in a highprofile application of a federal law that nullified forced arbitration for such cases ardith lindsey a managing director at citi alleged that her 15year career at the bank had increasingly become a traumatizing experience especially after she ended a relationship with a former supervisor the supervisor mani singh then sent her dozens of threatening text messages according to her lawsuit ms lindseys suit filed last week describes a workplace where many women confronted comments about their sexuality and attractiveness and worried that their careers would suffer if they complained it also highlights the need for big firms to consistently enforce policies meant to create a welcoming environment for all workers mark costiglio a citi spokesman said the bank had opened an investigation shortly after ms lindsey disclosed the relationship in november and complained about mr singhs alleged conduct and messages when she reported the vile text messages to us she described the relationship as having been consensual mr costiglio said he added that years earlier citi had investigated a personal financial transaction between the two and that ms lindsey described mr singh as a friend at the time mr singh resigned last november before the investigation was completed he is named in the suit but is not a defendant after being diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder ms lindsey also left several weeks later and is on longterm disability leave mr costiglio said the investigation had since concluded but he declined to share its findings our colleagues should feel confident they can raise concerns about themselves or others without fear of retribution and decisive action must be taken when unacceptable behavior takes place he said mr costiglio added that citi will defend against ms lindseys claims in court mr singh did not respond to detailed comment requests by email and text message ms lindsey told the new york times that she hoped the lawsuit would force the bank to take action against the bad behavior of male executives if it can happen to me when i was in the spotlight then it can happen to anyone she said wall street has long been notorious for a boys club culture where many women struggle to fit in in recent years especially after the metoo movement shined a spotlight on the nature and extent of sexual harassment and discrimination that women often face many companies including banks have taken steps to build a more inclusive workplace a company that strives to maintain a zerotolerance policy around sexual harassment and assault would investigate every single allegation of misconduct it receives in a timely fashion said lisa avalos a professor at the paul m hebert law center at louisiana state university based on her reading of the lawsuit ms avalos said ms lindsey appeared to be offering examples in which bank officials had failed to investigate potential misconduct multiple times the 45page suit exists in open court thanks to the federal law that prevents companies from forcing such cases into arbitration the law was passed after gretchen carlson the former fox news anchor and several other women sued the former fox news chairman roger ailes for trying to force them into having sex with him to date this lawsuit is the most highprofile case to shine a light on how wall street covers up entrenched sexual abuse and harassment since congress enacted the law to limit forced arbitration for survivors said linda lipsen the chief executive of the american association for justice a washington trade group for trial lawyers ms lindsey is seeking unspecified damages including benefits she would have received had she not faced the discriminatory treatment according to the lawsuit ms lindsey joined citi at age in when the bank bought

protection bureau said wednesday some employees were told not to discuss the practice in email and referred to applicants as armenian bad guys or the southern california armenian mafia the cfpb said the discrimination took place between and citigroup has been under an intense regulatory order to fix its riskmanaging systems and customerdata oversight an expensive and timeconsuming project that chief executive jane fraser has said is her no priority it is supposed to give the bank and regulators a clearer view of citis customers and employees and avoid these types of issues citigroup said wednesday that the employees involved in the discrimination were attempting to respond to a welldocumented armenian fraud ring operating in certain parts of california but the employees went beyond protocols and took impermissible actions the bank said it took appropriate action against the employees without being more specific while we prioritize protecting our bank and our customers from fraud

armenianamericans in southern california for instance in the federal bureau of investigation obtained indictments of people in a racketeering conspiracy involving the armenian power gang a bank cannot discriminate based on nationality or name it and must rely on more sophisticated fraud alerts and a web of information when deciding on applications those systems which are largely unseen by consumers are part of what citi is rebuilding under the regulatory order the order handed down in has roots in citigroups creation through a series of deals in the that cobbled together the first financial supermarket the bank has struggled for years to fully integrate the dozens of systems and backoffice codes that each company ran on and regulators believed that left the bank vulnerable to errors in a
