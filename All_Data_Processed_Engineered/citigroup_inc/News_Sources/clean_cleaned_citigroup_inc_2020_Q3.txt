citigroup inc  incoming chief executive jane frasers historic appointment last week shed a light on citigroups upside potential but investors hoping that might spark a rebound were greeted instead by news monday that the next phase of the banks investment will be strengthening and transforming its risk and control environment and a subsequent correction in the shares over monday through tuesdays close a presentation by the bank detailed billion in investments in that is roughly of analysts forecast for operating expenses however the bank noted that tech enhancements were generating productivity savings to fund more investment this should create capacity for these investments while holding expenses more or less flat chief financial officer mark mason said at the barclays global financial services conference this weeks stock move is perhaps an overreaction to that level of overall spending but there is context to consider the investment comes as citigroup is in the midst of dealing with a breakdown that led to an erroneous million bond payment the wall street journal also reported that federal regulators are preparing to reprimand citigroup for failing to improve risk systems trading at one of the steepest discounts to book value among its peers citigroup has huge potential for a sharp turnaround yet the timing of any rebound is increasingly hard to figure for one the pandemics continuing effect on banks overall expense plans is still murky banks have had to spend to accommodate employees and customers and to make emergency smallbusiness loans wells fargo in the midst of an even wider cost overhaul said on monday that it paused layoffs at the start of the pandemic yet at the same time fifth third bancorp on monday noted the trend toward digital banking was accelerating its techinvestment returns and its ability to rationalize its branch network also citigroup was more downbeat about economic trends than some peers a big question is what that means for credit particularly cards mr mason said on monday that the banks latest forecast contemplates a somewhat slower pace of economic recovery particularly in the us noting slower rehiring and less pickup in travel spend than the bank initially expected citigroup anticipates making further reserve builds in the third quarter though meaningfully lower than so far this year mr mason did say that we also see strong payment trends for card borrowers and that the bank wasnt yet seeing signs of outsize losses meanwhile fifth third said that indicators are moving in a more favorable direction and says based on that a further reserve build appears to be unlikely wells fargo was a bit more ambivalent saying its probably a little too soon to say that things are better than previously forecast but also that theyre probably not worse than previously forecast beatenup bank stocks like citigroup remain tempting turnaround bets but with the rest of the market hitting new highs the cost of waiting for bankings turn is steep federal regulators are preparing to reprimand citigroup inc for failing to improve its riskmanagement systems an expansive set of technology and procedures designed to detect problematic transactions risky trades and anything else that could harm the bank the expected rebuke from the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve accelerated planning for chief executive michael corbats retirement according to people familiar with the matter regulators didnt ask mr corbat to step down the people said rather he came to believe that an expensive multiyear systems overhaul designed to address regulators concerns was best left in the hands of his successor jane fraser they said citigroup said on thursday mr corbat would retire in february surprising analysts and investors who expected him to remain in the job for a few more years the rebuke which would come in the form of a consent order likely would require citigroup to develop and execute a plan to fix its risk systems the people said such formal regulatory actions sometimes come with fines or stricter oversight but it isnt clear what if any punishment would be imposed they said we are completely committed to improving our risk and control environment a citigroup spokeswoman said citing the banks efforts to strengthen controls infrastructure and governance however while we have made significant and demonstrable progress in each of these areas we recognize that we are not yet where we need to be and that has to change citigroups shares closed down to on monday after the wall street journal reported the expected regulatory action the kbw nasdaq bank index rose for years regulators have privately pressed citigroup and mr corbat to fix the banks risk systems according to people familiar with the matter a public rebuke would significantly ratchet up the pressure the fed and the occ have many tools at their disposal to address problems out of the public eye a consent order indicates that those methods didnt achieve the desired results regulators have faulted citis management for not giving priority to the riskmanagement overhaul the people said a recent highprofile flub citigroups accidental million payment to creditors of cosmetics company revlon inc was seen as evidence of weaknesses in the system the people said mr corbat who has run the bank since had been expected to retire sometime around citigroup elevated ms fraser last year to president and put her in charge of its consumer bank establishing her as the frontrunner to succeed mr corbat mr corbat was quietly planning a exit but hadnt discussed the exact timing with ms fraser or the board some of the people said over the labor day weekend he decided he would retire after closing out in part because of the work needed to address regulators concerns the people said in memos to citigroup staff thursday both mr corbat and ms fraser acknowledged that the bank needs to transform its internal systems for risk and compliance mr corbat is widely credited with sharpening the banks focus and reducing its sprawl during his eight years as ceo yet the bank has long struggled to convince regulators that it was moving fast enough to address their concerns the federal reserve gave citigroup in a failing grade on its annual stress test citing the banks gaps in assessing risk in its capital planning the bank revamped its risk models and hired more compliance employees it hasnt failed the test since citigroup is still operating under consent orders from and that required it to improve its antimoneylaundering processes the occ fined it in for failing to comply with the order at issue now is the infrastructure underpinning its broader risk systems a legacy of a string of deals in the that transformed the bank into a financial supermarket for instance many of citigroups various businesses commercial banking credit cards corporateadvisory services to name a few run on their own independent systems that have their own methods for tracking customers and transactions there are hundreds of identification systems inside the bank a customer doing business with several parts of the bank could have different identification codes for each one banking regulators require banks to track customers across all of their operations the idea is to catch crimes like money laundering and avoid errors that could harm customers while citigroup is able to keep tabs on customers across its businesses regulators worry that its mishmash of systems makes it vulnerable to costly and potentially damaging missteps people familiar with the matter said citigroup in recent months has tried to highlight its efforts to shore up its systems and convince regulators it is taking their concerns seriously in january a citigroup executive told bloomberg news the bank would hire coders to work on the technology underpinning its investment and corporatebanking businesses with an eye toward improving the banks ability to use the data they generate in june it named a new compliance chief and hired karen peetz the former president of bank of new york mellon corp to fill the new role of chief administrative officer ms peetz was given authority over broad bank safety projects including those aimed at improving data and antimoneylaundering efforts at the time mr corbat said she would bring consistency and clarity to dealings with regulators mr corbat has said the investments which total billion this year alone would make citigroup safer and more competitive next year citigroup will have a new chief executive for the first time in nearly a decade but it will still face some familiar challenges the global banking giant said jane fraser will succeed michael corbat next year when he retires ms fraser is a veteran of many of the banks units and currently president and global head of consumer banking she will be the first woman to lead a major wall street bank the vital questions that faced mr corbat when he took over such as whether the bank can routinely pass stress tests and achieve an acceptable return on equity were answered in the affirmative citigroups stock was a star in leading its peers with a more than gain now the banks earnings outlook depends in large part on when it can stop adding loanloss reserves and start releasing them and when it can accelerate lending growth again that depends on consumers and their credit cards credit cards have long been one of investors biggest pivot points for citigroup despite its globespanning institutional payments and retail banking businesses it is the most heavily reserved of any major us bank when measuring provisions as a percentage of projected severe stresstest losses at according to analyst steven chubak of wolfe research that isnt necessarily a function of pessimism in fact analysts at autonomous research note citigroup has a relatively less pessimistic base unemployment and gdp outlook than some peers it is more a reflection of the banks assets being weighted toward creditcard loans which seem to be the most at risk due to the pandemic this leaves citigroup in a familiar position despite its progress heavily discounted but with upside potential it is trading at one of the lowest ratios of pricetotangible book value among its peers at under times as a veteran of many of the banks businesses ms fraser is wellsuited to maximize citigroups longterm potential by figuring out how best to exploit digital banking and wringing maximum revenue out of its vast global footprint in money flows but wall street probably wont give her much credit for any of that until the bank is clear of nearterm risks in cards citigroup inc and a big hedgefund client are locked in an uncharacteristically public feud that has embroiled top executives at both firms and laid bare a million mistaken payment by the bank at the root of the dispute citis role helping billionaire investor ron perelman restructure the corporate loans of cosmetics company revlon inc some investors wanted citi to bow out of the transaction when it didnt they blamed the bank for facilitating a deal that hurt their investments according to people familiar with the matter and court documents chief among those investors billion money manager brigade capital management lp until recently brigade and its founder donald morgan had worked closely with citi brigade had hired citi to help it raise at least billion of new loan funds over the past two years according to sp global market intelligence the bank had also advised mr morgan on potential mergerandacquisition opportunities for brigade in previous years people familiar with the matter said now citi and brigade are slugging it out in court cutting ties and arguing over the return of around million the fund received when the bank accidentally paid revlon lenders about million citi even took the extraordinary step last month of backing out of a nearly completed deal to arrange a million collateralized loan obligation for brigade as well as another deal that was in earlier stages according to people familiar with the matter this cost the bank about million in lost fees the people said though our fiduciary duty to our clients has put us into conflict with citibank relating to their role as agent on the revlon term loan brigade has not sought to limit any other business or trading activity with citibank as a consequence of this specific disagreement a spokeswoman for brigade said the fight is an example
