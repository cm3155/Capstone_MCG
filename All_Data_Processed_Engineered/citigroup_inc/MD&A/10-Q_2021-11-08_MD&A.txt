refer to citigroup inc and its consolidated subsidiaries certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods financial statements and notes to conform to the current periods presentation summary of significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements in citigroups annual report on form 10k for a summary of all of citigroups significant accounting policies accounting changes accounting for financial instruments credit losses overview in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no financial instruments credit losses topic the asu introduced a new credit loss methodology the current expected credit losses cecl methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk citi adopted the asu as of january which as discussed below resulted in an increase in citis allowance for credit losses and a decrease to opening retained earnings net of deferred income taxes at january the cecl methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans heldtomaturity debt securities receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired the acl is adjusted each period for changes in lifetime expected credit losses the cecl methodology represents a significant change from prior us gaap and replaced the prior multiple existing impairment methods which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset the methodology generally results in an earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related acl than prior us gaap for availableforsale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that citi intends to hold or morelikelythannot will not be required to sell creditrelated impairment if any is recognized through an acl and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk january cecl transition day impact the cecl methodologys impact on expected credit losses among other things reflects citis view of the current state of the economy forecasted macroeconomic conditions and quality of citis portfolios at the january date of adoption based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time the aggregate impact to citi was an approximate billion or an approximate pretax increase in the allowance for credit losses along with a billion aftertax decrease in retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of billion this transition impact reflects i a billion build to the allowance for credit losses for citis consumer exposures primarily driven by the impact on credit card receivables of longer estimated tenors under the cecl lifetime expected credit loss methodology loss coverage of approximately months compared to shorter estimated tenors under the probable loss methodology under prior us gaap loss coverage of approximately months net of recoveries and ii a release of billion of reserves primarily related to citis corporate net loan loss exposures largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components citis quantitative component of the allowance for credit losses is model based and utilizes a single forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios complemented by the qualitative component described below in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product for example citis consumer models use a 13quarter reasonable and supportable period and revert to historical loss experience thereafter while its corporate loan models use a ninequarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a threequarter graduated transition to historical loss experience the qualitative management adjustment component includes among other things management adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative component such as concentrations collateral coverage model limitations idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the acl the qualitative management adjustment component also includes management adjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates accounting for variable postchargeoff thirdparty collection costs in the fourth quarter of citi revised the second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable postchargeoff thirdparty collection costs from a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle to a change in accounting principle which required an adjustment to january opening retained earnings rather than net income as a result citis fullyear and quarterly results for were revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of january as follows an increase to beginning retained earnings on january of million and a decrease of million in the allowance for credit losses on loans as well as a million decrease in other assets related to income taxes a decrease of million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of million and million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters respectively increases in operating expenses of million and million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses in the first and second quarters respectively in making these revisions citi considered the guidance in asc topic accounting changes and error corrections asc topic interim reporting asc topic 250s991 assessing materiality and asc topic 250s9923 accounting changes not retroactively applied due to immateriality considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements citi believes that the effects of the revisions were not material to any previously reported quarterly or annual period reference rate reform in march the fasb issued asu no reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting specifically the guidance permits an entity when certain criteria are met to consider amendments to contracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a modification under us gaap it further allows hedge accounting to be maintained and permits a onetime transfer or sale of qualifying heldtomaturity securities the expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time through december and do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after december except for certain optional expedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as of december the asu was adopted by citi as of june with prospective application and did not impact financial results in in january the fasb issued asu no reference rate reform topic scope which clarifies that the scope of the initial accounting relief issued by the fasb in march includes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest rate for margining discounting or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform commonly referred to as the discounting transition the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made after december new hedging relationships entered into after december and existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after december except for hedging relationships existing as of december that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship the asu was adopted by citi on a full retrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial results in future accounting changes longduration insurance contracts in august the fasb issued asu no financial servicesinsurance targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts which changes the existing recognition measurement presentation and disclosures for longduration contracts issued by an insurance entity specifically the guidance i improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for longduration insurance contracts ii simplifies and improves the accounting for certain marketbased options or guarantees associated with deposit or account balance contracts iii simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and iv introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures citi has certain insurance subsidiaries primarily in mexico that issue longduration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and lifecontingent annuity contracts that will be impacted by the requirements of asu the effective date of asu was deferred for all insurance entities by asu financial servicesinsurance effective date issued in october and by asu financial servicesinsurance effective date and early application issued in november citi plans to adopt the targeted improvements in asu on january and is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its insurance subsidiaries citi does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard discontinued operations

by the company as of september and december evaluating investments for impairment afs debt securities overviewafs debt securities the company conducts periodic reviews of all afs debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the companys intent to sell such securities an afs debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual afs debt security is less than its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired afs debt securities that citi has an intent to sell or for which citi believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those afs debt securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit losses any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in aoci the company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists for afs debt securities credit losses exist where citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the afs debt securitys amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value the allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings the companys review for impairment of afs debt securities generally entails identification and evaluation of impaired investments consideration of evidential matter including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment and documentation of the results of these analyses as required under citis policies the sections below describe the companys process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of september mortgagebacked securities citi records no allowances for credit losses on us governmentagencyguaranteed mortgagebacked securities because the company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties state and municipal securities the process for estimating credit losses in citigroups afs state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating ignoring any insurance is aa2aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrumentspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments for afs state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citi plans to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell the full impairment is recognized in earnings for afs state and municipal bonds where citi has no intent to sell and it is morelikelythannot that the company will not be required to sell citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect capped at the difference between the bonds amortized cost basis and fair value equity method investments management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for otherthantemporary impairment otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note to the consolidated financial statements for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would morelikelythannot be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized as otti in other revenue regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not morelikelythannot to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value recognition and measurement of impairment the following tables present total impairment on investments recognized in earnings three months ended

nonmarketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless i the measurement alternative is elected or ii the investment

measurement alternative is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis under the measurement alternative an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer the carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired impairment indicators that are considered include but are not limited to the following a significant deterioration in the earnings performance credit rating asset quality or business prospects of the investee a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of the investee a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates a bona fide offer to purchase an offer by the investee to sell or a completed auction
