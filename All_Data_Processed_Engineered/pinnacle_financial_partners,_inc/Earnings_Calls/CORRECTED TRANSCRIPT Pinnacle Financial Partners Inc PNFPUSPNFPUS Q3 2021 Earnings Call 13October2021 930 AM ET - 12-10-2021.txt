reconciliation of the nongaap measures to the comparable gaap measures will be available on the pinnacle financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that i am now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator and thank you everybody for being with us this morning in my view third quarter was an exceptional quarter with very strong loan growth very strong core deposit growth strong net interest income growth and strong noninterest income growth asset quality is ph the second best numbers for most key asset quality metrics and importantly our relentless focus on tangible book value accretion continue to yield strong results i believe what is evident is that our decadelong approach to attracting exciting market best bankers and empowering and enabling them to create ph raise in clients is in fact enriching shareholders and because of the sustained execution of that model i expect that to continue to produce exciting results for an extended period of time to come thereve been various studies over the years revealing the key shareholder returns for banks will generally be about eps growth rates revenue growth rates and asset quality our business model is generally a roughly spread business which means an ability to consistently take share and grow the balance sheet is the key to revenue and eps growth rate which is why we focus intently on loan and deposit growth rates and so we begin every shareholder presentation with this dashboard which gives us a read on revenue and eps growth balance sheet growth and asset quality of course we always start with the gaap measures but i found for me personally i focus on a number of non gaap measures that have me better ascertain how well were performing on the key variables that were trying to manage here at pinnacle as you look across the top row you can see remarkably consistent up into the right growth in revenues eps and adjusted pretax preprovision net revenues similarly across the second row we produced net loan growth this quarter even with meaningful ppp pay downs and forgiveness annualized organic loan growth excluding the impacts of ppp was core deposits specifically noninterestbearing deposits continued to soar in  and all that resulted in a tangible book value per share cagr of since along the bottom row you can see our asset quality performed exceptionally well even during covid net chargeoffs were inside our targets and the other key problem loan categories we monitor are at decade long loans id like to peel back the onion just a minute to provide better insight as to what causes the key growth metrics to be so consistently up into the right as we were positioned in some of the best markets in this country to grow which of course is the simplest part of our growth formula we should produce outsized growth simply because the markets in which we operate are expected to continue to outgrow the nation but beyond that as a result of our ability to attract the market best bankers both in the markets in which we currently operate as well as in other pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 large urban markets in the southeast where were likely to have additional market extending opportunities and the proven ability of these bankers to wow our clients in an environment where our largest competitors have so many angry and frustrated clients should yield meaningful outsized growth and i hasten to add our formula of only hiring highly experienced revenue producers puts us in an unusual position to produce an outsized growth while maintaining an attractive asset quality metric since the market share movement occurs as a result of these experienced bankers moving their borrowers when theyre indiscernible behind its the only way i know to reliably produce such rapid growth on a sound basis it seems obvious from the dashboard slide that we began with this model has in fact produced rapid reliable growth over an extended period of time but i want to spend a minute focusing on our model and why i expect it to continue to produce outsized growth while the model is radically simple as a concept its our relentless execution over years that differentiates us as ive already said our model to attract and excite market best bankers empower and enable them to create ph raise in clients which would then translate shareholder returns our associate engagement is literally among the best employers in the country its longstanding its across virtually every associate group like being one of the best workplaces for women for millennials for parents and its across our entire footprint in virtually every major market it works that way because weve got a unique hiring model because weve got a valuebased culture our annual incentive model where a of our associates win and lose together based on achieving corporate performance targets for things like asset quality and eps growth rates our longterm incentive model which makes shareholders out of every single associates and our leadership management and accountability for how well they engage their associates just to name a few over the years ive heard any number of bankers saying that they were running the pinnacle model but honestly virtually none of them were doing any one of those things that i just mentioned building on that foundation they decided to indiscernible to wow their clients which create great advance things like our focus on geographic decision making close to the client as opposed to centralized line of business structures which we combine with our signature ph creditism which yields favored response a wide budget where every single associate is authorized to spend any amount they deem appropriate in order to wow clients all of these are recognizably different than our primary competitors which enables these highly experienced associates to wow their clients in the center era were looking at a net promoter score provided by greenwich for businesses with annual sales from million to million our net promoter score is market leading in both the state of tennessee and north carolina and extremely high ranking in every metropolitan market in which we have large enough share that produces statistically valid sample in fact according to greenwich we have the second highest net promoter score in the united states thats indeed an unusually engaged client base who recommends us to their peers and result in strong momentum meaning they also indicate a high likelihood that they intend to do more business with us and on the far right you can see that weve successfully translated that relentless focus on our associates and clients into shareholder value the shareholder returns have been outsized i might even say astoundingly outsized from the beginning and over the prior 10year 5year 3year and 1year time horizons so as you can see the model has indeed yielded remarkably reliable and predictable outcomes pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 and then finally as it relates to the sustainability of the growth one of the things that has been so far about what our future growth is is the pace at which were attracting these market best revenue producers i dont think its a secret that a number of the banks that are the largest market shareholders in our markets which are in the southeast are extraordinarily vulnerable and i would say emerging talent some are vulnerable because they simply become so large and bureaucratic some are what appear to be regulatory difficulties which invariably makes the lives of bankers miserable and some are inwardly focused as a result of merger and integration projects pinnacle is widely recognized as an employer of choice for all the reasons weve already discussed this morning and the more bankers we hire from these large banks the more bankers were able to hire from these large banks much like indiscernible created clients that are net promoters that recommend us to their friends and peers we created associates that are net promoters that vouch for us and invite their peers from their former employers to join us at pinnacle this created extraordinary opportunities to hire in the markets that we currently operate in but its also created market extending opportunities like atlanta georgia birmingham alabama huntsville alabama and i fully expect that we will encounter other similar opportunities in other large highgrowth markets around the southeast as you can see on the left weve attracted a very large number of revenue producers over the last few years in fact roughly of our revenue producers have been here less than two years think about that of our revenue producers have been here less than two years our experience is that it generally takes relationship manager four to five years to fully move their book of business so that would lead me to believe were currently incurring of the expenses that are associated with substantial revenue production we should materialize over the next two to three years you can see the power of that not only on balance sheet and revenue growth but on earnings growth as well and to the right you gain some sense of the power of the model when you attract so many experienced revenue producers from the banks that have the largest market share in these markets youre in an unusual opportunity to capitalize on their vulnerability and accelerate share gains so in short in addition to the highlighting the up into the right performance that weve had and continued this quarter on virtually all key metrics that influence shareholder returns ive tried to illustrate both why i believe it has happened and why im so personally excited about the ongoing growth opportunity i see for the firm with that ill turn it over to harold for a more in depth look at the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody were again pleased with our third quarter loan growth results excluding ppp average loans were up between the third and second quarters and as to end of period loans at september compared to june were up overall loan rates were up slightly from the second quarter as the third quarter was again assisted by ppp forgiveness we believe we will see another meaningful quarter of ppp forgiveness in the fourth quarter so that ppps impact on hopefully will be minimal due to accelerated forgiveness third quarter yield on ppp loans rose to from in the second quarter we recognized million of ppp revenues in the third quarter down from million in the second quarter due to ppp balances now dropping to approximately million at the end of the third quarter we anticipate fourth quarter ppp revenues will range somewhere between million and million pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 excluding ppp loans our average loan yield approximated compared to approximately in the second quarter weve been stating for quite some time that maintaining loan yields will be a difficult chore but with some tailwind on rising rates we can be hopeful that increasing loan yields are just around the corner i commend our sales force for what theyve been able to accomplish so far this year our new markets in huntsville and birmingham have recruited seven revenue producers from a standing start and after only a few weeks of operations have approximately million in loans slightly more in deposit and a great pipeline atlanta continues to roll with revenue producers and million in loans at september our optimism for these markets as well as our new hires in equipment finance and franchise lending give us reason to be even more optimistic about our loan growth targets for next year previously weve been talking about highsingle digit growth for this year our market leaders are even more optimistic about our loan growth and that they will likely end up with lowdouble digit growth rate for as for given current economic conditions and our optimism about our new markets and business lines we believe a growth rate for loans inclusive of ppp payoffs of lowdouble digits is a reasonable objective for our firm now on to deposits we had another big deposit quarter core deposits were up almost billion in the third quarter we experienced significant growth pin noninterest bearing deposit ending up at billion at quarter end up since the end of last year our average deposit rates were basis points while eop deposit rates were at basis points so we continue to see downward momentum for and look to see a few more basis points in reduced deposit costs by yearend helping us get there would be about million in maturing cds in the fourth quarter which have an average rate of approximately basis points as to liquidity we continue to look at ways to create increased earnings momentum through deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets as well as elimination of wholesale funding sources where we are getting close to accomplishing that we are optimistic that loan volume growth in should help reduce our overall liquidity next year but this will be a multiyear effort our objective here is to find ways to put money to work in a rising rate environment without placing too much risk on tangible book value growth more to come on this as this will be a topic for several quarters but suffice it to say that we are all gaining more confidence as to the stickiness of all this deposit growth that has occurred over the last yearandahalf as to credit the four big traditional credit metrics of net chargeoffs classified assets npa and past due accruing loans pinnacles loan portfolio continue to perform very well and in many cases these are some of the best credit metric ratios weve experienced in our history for example the trend lines for classified assets and npa since thats precovid then through covid until today is a testament to the great work of our bankers and credit officers additionally we anticipate further declines in our allowance for loan loss to total loans ratio over the next several quarters given continued improvement in these factors as well as macroeconomic factors now to fee income again lots of good news here for the quarter fee revenues were up more than over the third quarter of last year wealth management which includes investment services trust and insurance had a great quarter in comparison to last year we continue to be very active on the hiring front across our franchise particularly as we continue to build wealth management in our newer markets mortgage rebounded this quarter as this pipeline rebuilt towards the end of the third quarter as to run rate issues for we had another strong showing with respect to our equity investments which exclude bhg again one of our investments finalize an equity raise during the quarter the results of which provided us significant insight into an updated valuation of that investment and thus would book million from this one investment along with pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 about almost million from other valuation adjustments all in we dont expect a similar increase in the fourth quarter we also received about million in vendor incentives on checking accounts as to bhg ill talk about that in just a second as to expenses specifically incentives i think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive cost to our expense base so i wont go into all that this quarter we continue to anticipate an outsized incentive for however theres no free lunch increased incentives only occur if our earnings and ppnr growth support the incentive additionally we anticipate our max payout target going back to the traditional in as to our overall total expense run rate we now believe that expenses for the fourth quarter should be flat to down from the amounts we experienced in both the second and third quarters and anticipate to growth in which is primarily attributable to head count growth as well as our entering into new markets and new business lines quickly some comments on capital we intend to redeem million in subdebt in midnovember and as i mentioned last time and i want to just reinforce the point weve intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a peer relative component in our leaderships equity compensation plan we are currently calculating an annualized increase of in tangible book value per share thus far in which we believe is pretty good relative to other peers our plan is designed such that we will compare our tangible book value per share growth with that of our peers along with relative rotce and total shareholder return in determining the ultimate vesting results for our leadership group lastly as to our outlook for the rest of i wont go into the slide in depth as we covered much of this previously so this again is really a summary for the model builders out there of what we think about the fourth quarter of this year now to bhg many of you participated in a bhg investor call we had last month al crawford and dan mcsherry did a great job in updating everyone on bhgs activities since there has not been any meaningful change since that time i will spend less time on bhg this go around i will highlight that bhg did close their third securitization since the conference call and look to have another probably in the first quarter of next year the blue bars on the top left chart details originations with records being set nearly every quarter for the past three quarters the green bar represents loans of which gain on sale has been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream banks obviously the gap between loan originations and loan sold find their way onto bhgs balance sheet for either a downstream sale in a later quarter or perhaps becoming part of a future securitization loan yields ended at for the third quarter as to the bank buy rate they fell to so net spreads remain in range the bottom right chart details now over banks in bhgs network and almost individual banks acquired bhg loans last year coupled with the securitization process bhg remains one of the strongest funding platforms in the country as to credit weve updated bhgs recourse obligation chart on the chart on the left the green bars detail loans that bhg has sold to their network of community and other banks which currently amount to billion in credit sold through their network the blue line details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these banks bhg decreased the pandemicrelated recourse reserves again this quarter to approximately million at the end of the quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 as a percentage of loans it was down approximately basis points as noted on the chart at the bottom right the trailing losses landed at this chart splits the actual credit losses from losses bhg absorbed from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank paid to get the loan the increase for prepayment losses is partially attributable to actual premiums paid for bhg credit has gotten larger consumer credit tends to have a higher prepayment track record and loans being paid off earlier as rates have decreased top left chart weve shown on several occasions the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily in the past and over the last few years bhg continues to refine their scorecards and increase the quality of its borrowing base looking at losses our vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months thus pointing toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loan pandemicrelated events may cause these losses to move upward but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much better than just from a few years ago just a tad more on credit for the loans sold to other banks credit losses or substitution losses as noted in the previous slide for the first nine months of this year have amounted to with third quarter substitution losses coming in at around for loans on balance sheet held for investment and potentially future securitization yeartodate losses have amounted to approximately with third quarter losses being approximately bhg had another great quarter in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations yet again weve kept our expectations for at approximately growth were also sticking with a growth factor for of approximately as the slide indicate theyve got more ideas that are in some stage of development which if successful should foster continued growth over the next several quarters bhg is in the process of planning their growth for the next several years they believe that over the next few years interest income from owned balance sheet loans will likely exceed the gain on sale model how they proceed will obviously impact the timing for income recognition as gain on sale accelerates current income while the owned balance sheet model recognizes income over the life of the loan as to the other business opportunities noted on the slide they are analyzing all of these to further develop their financial plans as they aim to continue their outsized growth so wrapping up as to loan growth and loan pricing for pinnacle in it will take a lot of work but we are very optimistic deposit growth has been remarkable deposit pricing continues to decrease net interest income we believe will be flattish for the fourth quarter bhg has another great quarter and we continue to believe in that franchise expenses should be flat to down again in the fourth quarter with that of the third quarter operator with that ill turn it back over to you for questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions analysts will be given preference during the qa again we do ask that while you post your questions that you pick up your headsets for optimal sound quality our first question is from stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co terry you did a really good job of kind of talking through the hiring strategy and how its benefited you over these years i was wondering if you could go even a little deeper into that and talk about what youre seeing on the kind of economic growth front versus the takeaway hiring growth front and kind of how you think about that within your forward growth guidance is that still primarily in anticipation of growth from your hires or are you guys seeing some actual economic positive economic growth trends as well m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i would say that we have not seen a lot of what i would call pure economic growth i dont its probably something better than zero but it wouldnt be robust by any means if you look at things like line of credit working capital lines ci lines those kinds of things were not seeing increased funding there and so again the economic growth is greater than zero but its not very large it is more about our new hires that are producing volumes stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and when you guys think about trying to forecast growth for your franchises i mean how do you think about that is it hey if we got economic growth we could actually grow or do you guys break it down in that kind of fashion as you think about forecasting m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc we steve i think were like anybody else were going to look at it different ways trying to figure out what makes the most sense and what the truth is and all those kinds of things so we certainly try to look at it that way i think in the final analysis what we most frequently land on is sort of a bottoms up outlook what is it that the financial advisors believe theyre going to produce so what does the market leader believe theyre going to produce based on the aggregation of what those guys are going to produce and so anyway its some pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 combination of all those things but i personally put most confidence on market leaders and what they believe theyre going to be able to produce stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then im wondering you kind of talked about birmingham huntsville atlanta and then some new product expansions that you guys have moved into obviously are there other i guess nearterm expansions on the horizon that you see whether it be new product verticals that you all would like to get into from a lending perspective or other new msas that you could highlight or do you feel like youve got your plate pretty full with whats going on now m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i guess the answer to the last question there is that we feel like we have our plate full no we dont feel that way weve got lots of opportunities and its i mean honestly its an exciting time for us there are just lots of opportunities when you think about our opportunities again so if everybody goes out in different way so i just sort of tell you how we go at it mainly what we think about is talent acquisition mainly the way that occurs is weve hired so many people who say hey you need to go hire indiscernible you need to go hire this person i work with them up there they share our values then they can produce this they can build this and so forth and so early in our companys existence that was primarily just got into hiring people at local geographic markets but because we have hired so many and expanding market that word has gotten out would create more opportunities in other markets where people from some of the banks like a wells or truist or those kinds of things where people are saying to their buddies hey man can you help me get in over there i might want to build market in this indiscernible in this market those kinds of things and it would be the same idea on some of the specialty lending areas again we have opportunities because the people weve hired that hire people that have run in specialty practices for some of our largest competitors and so thats really what stimulates that so we were trying to give you some things about how we think about it and get back to primarily about talent acquisition whats available and so forth about seizing the opportunities that we like within that and i guess the net of all that is i do believe well have opportunities to go to other larger in southeastern markets in the reasonably short term and i expect well have opportunities indiscernible specialty lending business stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful maybe just last thing for me im curious if you have a number for how much you guys added on balance sheet of bhg loans this quarter and kind of how youre thinking about that in terms of how much that youd want to put on balance sheet or if theres any sort of concentration limit you have in mind for that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold do you want to take that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 yeah steve i apologize terry and i are in separate rooms because of social distancing this morning yeah i think the number was like million but ill follow up with you on that number stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate it guys congrats on a great quarter once again m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe sticking with the growth conversation can you give us an update on how the conversion of new ppp customers is going so the customers that you brought into the bank through ppp how is the conversion of them going to serve full service customers and deposit relationships m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold if you have any detailed numbers feel free to jump in jared i dont have detailed numbers where i can say okay this is what it is and this is what it is in this geographic market and so forth my sense is that it is good and thats my only basis for saying that is when you look at the greenwich data we have an extraordinarily high percentage of our clients that view us to be their primary bank and the number moves around some jared but i believe the number is of the folks who have a relationship with us view us to be their primary bank and thats a really extraordinarily high penetration of being the primary bank to the folks who have any banking relationship with so again im just saying in the way our programs are built the way the incentives are built everybody focused on meeting all of the needs of any plan that they have but specifically to be able to say to you okay this is what weve done on the ppp client i couldnt do that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thank you and then pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc jared yeah ill just follow up on one point on that quickly i think if you go back to the start of the ppp program we specifically told our sales force to target our own clients and not use ppp so much as a business development tool so we did give atlanta kind of an exception of that because it was a new market and i think the retention there has been strong relative to ppp but we did not necessarily put ppp in the a slot of being a business development kind of strategy we felt like it was a limited resource we felt like that the government that the money would fill up quickly and we wanted to take care of individual clients first and foremost i just want to add that point jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah got it great thank you and then when we look at the expense growth rate of whats the underlying expectation for revenue producers being hired and is that growing from what weve seen in or is it sort of stable in that to additional people m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think and harold again feel free to offer any color that you want i think jared that the expectation for will be higher than your number of to in other words it will be kind of expected to be north of i think fourth quarter will be a pretty big hard quarter for us as well and so i think the annual number will be in the to range and i would expect that to be replicated in the next year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc jared ill just tag on here like all good cfos weve gotten our first look at the expense plan for next year and itll choke a horse but anyway theres a lot of people these our folks are anticipating to hire well get that to a point where that to growth we believe traditionally is the right number for us but terry is absolutely right i think our momentum on revenue producers is extraordinary right now and i think weve got some good news coming over the next several quarters jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks and then just finally for me looking at those other investments those other equity investments besides bhg can you give us an update on how much money have you invested in that program and what do you expect do you expect to continue to grow that as an investment source or are you happy with the amount you put out there now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 yeah we fully anticipate continue to invest in these other joint venture firms all of them we have some sort of relationship with or have had a history of business transactions with all of them i know early in our early in pinnacles life we invested in several here in nashville because traditionally we had known the principles weve worked with them over an extended period of time and i think to a large extent that has continued these venture funds bring us deposits they bring us lending opportunities through their portfolio companies and so it makes for a good business model for us and that that has held true here of recent times the fintechs were focused on are the newer ones or ones that have some kind of financial bankrelated emphasis and well continue to work that i think ive got somewhere around million of investments in these various fintech firms theres probably i dont know just a wild guess of them that weve got some sort of commitment with and we fully expect that that number will get bigger did i get to your question jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc you did yeah yeah thanks very much and then just i guess just finally tying up on that when you said that you dont expect the same level of growth in realized gains in the fourth quarter does that mean that we should expect to see it drop back to more where it was first and second quarter or that it wont grow from here but could be sustainable at that level harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean we fully expect that the value of these funds will appreciate at a reasonable rate over time but weve caught kind of lightning in a bottle here over the last couple of quarters with these investments and we dont anticipate booking million million in the fourth quarter but we think well have something but it wont be that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thanks very much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc and just as soon as i say that ill get something in the mail next week operator thank you our next question comes from jenny demba with truist securities your line is open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jen jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 terry you guys are having a tremendous amount of success right now and im just wondering with all the consolidation thats occurring in the industry right now is there any type of opportunity that would be compelling for you and how do you think about opportunities like that with the backdrop of the buyer stocks getting so punished most of the time these days thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well jennifer as you know thats like my least favorite question because every time i say something we did it doesnt turn out to be the right thing to say but ill do the best i can tell you what the truth is and let the cards fall where they may you know this going back when our stock was getting hammered and growers were being punished we traded down their tangible book value and people kept asking about ma and i kept saying look no way forget it were not going to do it i just wouldnt deploy the stock when it was trading in that intangible book value as the multiples came back i felt compelled to put the market on notice hey the answer is not definitely no the answer is well theres a possibility of it and ive tried to work that and help people understand i need to say its possible because it is possible we are we did have an advantage paper and all that sort of stuff but you know this jennifer because youve studied you run the screens and run the scans you know what were looking for there are not a plethora of opportunities out there that would fit and so when i say fit im just talking about hit our earnings accretion targets hit our cultural requirements all those kind of things and so i have not believed that even though ive tried to say look this is a possibility and i havent believed it is very likely and i continue to believe its still not very likely the organic growth opportunities that were having right now are breathtaking and so as you know all that does is drive the attracting this threshold up for doing an ma transaction and so it doesnt get more likely i think it gets less likely because of all the organic growth opportunities that we have again i refuse to rule it out i want to be on record saying hey again i hope yeah its possible we did have an advantaged stock if we my belief is if we find something that meets the accretion targets hits the cultural requirements and is more attractive than the organic growth opportunities we have my guess is me and you and everybody else ought to be really excited so anyway its a possibility but i think i wouldnt put it in the extremely likely category jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks terry are there any companies that could meet the cultural hurdle for you because it seems like that hurdle is the one thats really the most difficult m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think thats true i think the answer to that is yes if i could catch it this way jennifer i think if you look back at something like bnc there are some people who kind of tend to follow what you call culture and what you include in culture and those kinds of things or people who no doubt were skeptical of our ability to execute that transaction but the case was that rick callicutt has determined he needed to move away from the model that he was running and wanted to move toward a model like we were running and that really through that decision and that choice for him preceded our getting together and all those kinds of things pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 and so it allowed for a cultural integration because the ceo was wanting to and trying to travel down the path we were on albeit different from the path he had originally been on so anyway im just trying to say i think when you find those kinds of situations where management teams are like minded about where to go and all those kinds of things then you have a chance and i do honestly believe we did have a growing number of people who were curious about inquisitive and ill just use this word i guess respectful of our model and interested in it so youre on the right track the cultural integration hurdle is difficult and it does exclude lots of folks that might show up well in if youre just running a model and but we end up walking away because of cultural integration is a bridge too far my guess is there would be precious few but a few where likeminded ceos might be able to do something but itd be a precious few jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks for the color terry operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone this is anthony elian on for steve terry you were very active in hiring new talent in the third quarter in your newer markets of atlanta birmingham and huntsville but these are the areas where youre seeing the strongest pipelines for new hires compared with markets such as tennessee and the carolinas or is the strength in recruiting pipelines across your entire footprint m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think i would say generally the strength is across the entire footprint maybe just a little color behind that we have had a great hiring year in raleigh north carolina weve had a great hiring year in charlotte north carolina atlanta is a fabulous hiring market with lots of upside in it as well and then to your point i think we believe were going to make more hires in birmingham and in huntsville in the case of nashville we continue to make hires here some of the folks that weve hired here are i would put in the lending specialty category we talked about equipment finance and franchise lending where weve been able to attract some toptier talent out of large competitors and so thats sort of been the thrust here in nashville but hopefully thats helpful to think about we are seeing really strong hiring momentum in the largest most rapidly growing markets that are dominated by wells and truist in particular so i think that hopefully that tells you what youre looking for anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats helpful and then on bhg you reiterated the guidance of growth normalizing back to but how much upside or potential upside is there from the new initiatives from bhg including targeting skilled professions and eventually rolling out a potential pointofsale lending product harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 hi tony its harold i dont know if we can give you a number to increase the right now we feel like is probably a good number to kind of use for your modeling if what they could do as an alternative is increase their own balance sheet lending focus and pull back on gain on sale to kind of warehouse for future years so id be very hesitant increasing it over right now anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and then finally on loan growth so youre already doing lowdouble digits loan growth in the current environment but given all the hiring youve done pipeline remaining strong and potentially adding a few new specialty lending segments why wouldnt you be able to exceed the lowdouble digit loan growth guidance you provided for thank you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc terry ill start that and you can correct me but so tony make sure you understand that for i said inclusive of ppp paydowns so we anticipate quite a bit of ppp paydowns next year we started call it million or so so that loan growth target wouldnt be inclusive of that coming out of the run rate so if you include if you exclude ppp then youre more into a lowsingle middouble digit kind of growth rate does that make sense anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it thank you operator your next question comes from brett rabatin with hovde group your line is open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted to circle back to loan growth and just from a line item perspective and talk maybe about construction and commercial construction specifically in the tennessee markets just curious the growth there is that been building and they finally came to having clients actually drawing lines of credit there can you talk maybe about the construction line and what youre seeing in that business m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah harold do you want me to take that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill just start with that generally lines of credit were not seeing a significant increase in lines of credit but construction is obviously beefing up some m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think brett to add to harolds comment there i do think its an interesting line item with high volatility in it when you get underneath whats going on so what i mean by that is this is a market where weve had loans with the paydowns are dramatic weve had loans where youre going to traditionally fund construction loans through up to a stabilization period weve had permanent lenders taking us out before stabilization and even some before construction completed i believe and so again youve got that extraordinary paydowns in there so some of it when you see the growth in a quarter or two some of it just had to do whats the volume of paydowns the headwinds that youre running against and there is no doubt that we do have meaningful construction commitments where theres significant equity in front of us that gets burned through before we get to the construction funding so the emphasis over the last months would not have changed but it is a volatile market both in terms of what projects are being done how much equity is in front of the construction funding and what the volume of early paydowns is which in my judgment has been extraordinary over the last year or so brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay i appreciate the color there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc brett one more point on construction im looking at some numbers that arent in the deck but construction and land development funding was at june and at weve got about call it billion in exposure of which billion is funded so theres quite a bit of headroom in that construction book brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats very helpful i appreciate that harold and then im curious just thinking about this whole fintech thing and youve obviously made some investments do you guys think about this more passively in terms of you think these things are great to invest in and then they might help you from an expertise perspective or tech perspective or might you get more active in terms of actually building out like your own bankingasaservice platform and actually possibly putting fee income from those operations and maybe loans from lenders on your balance sheet m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think that the latter is less likely brett i think the motivation for us has been going back to harolds comments about how we got started we were investing in funds where we knew people and it provided deal flow deposit flow all those sorts of things it was an important economic for us how we built the business i think in all the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 years our strategy has always been to be a fast bowler from a technological standpoint here just in terms of what our business model is and how we deliver services and so forth but as you know over the last decade the pace of that thing has stepped up significantly and so to be a fast bowler you got to be in the game and know where stuff is and whats moving and those kinds of thing and so that was thats really the honey of what we were trying to get to as i always say we wouldnt do it just for that reason in other words were not going to make bad investment so we can watch technology grow which is generally fortunate to have friends and partners that were able to participate with that that do it well and it is helpful to us as we study technology and i guess going back to your last point we are finding some investments there where there are opportunities for us to utilize those products or for us to introduce some of those product capabilities to other folks that were integrated with as an example like raymond james who as you know thats our brokerage platform retail brokerage platform is the raymond james and so we have opportunities to match them up on things too so anyway just a longwinded way to say we wouldnt do it if we thought it was a bad idea but principal motivation is to stay close to whats going on in fintech and yes there likely to be synergistic opportunities but i dont think were headed to a major line item for that sort of fee income brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then last one if i could just looking at the slide slide on the revenue producer adds that dark blue piece other is would that mostly be other larger regional banks or would that be smaller community banks in that bucket m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well its sum it is sum of everything but i would think the preponderance would be other large banks brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great appreciate all the color m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you brett operator our next question comes from michael rose raymond james your line is open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for the shout out just before m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to delve into the comments that i think you had terry on the comfort list with the liquidity thats come in from the ppp program and things like that it looks like securities to earning assets are about so just wanted to get a sense of how much the securities portfolio could continue to grow from here just given that comfort and then as we think about next year in light of the expense guidance and the loan growth that youve guided that youve given do you think exppp fees you have the ability to actually drive positive operating leverage thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ill start with that the investment securities as far as growth in securities i dont believe will add a significant amount we are looking at can based on what rate curve were looking were anticipating if we were to invest over a period of time and call it say a number of million to billion in securities michael can will the rate curve respond in such a way that tangible book value doesnt get for lack of a better word indiscernible so we are thinking about that i know some banks have put out there if the 10year gets to or some number like that we dont necessarily have a number like that in mind but we are studying it and looking at various alternatives because i think at the core to this whole discussion is whether or not we think these deposits are going to stick around and right now we think these deposits are sticky there was a lot of discussion over the last several quarters about surge deposits but it looks like for our client base these deposits that weve accumulated over the last year or so look to be hanging in there and will stick around for extended period of time i dont know if thats exactly what you were looking for michael if its not let me know and ill try to give you some more but thats what we think here michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc no thats helpful and for the second part of the question just about operating leverage exppp fees do you think thats a possibility just in light of the loan growth and the expense outlook for next year thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah when youre talking to me i think theres always going to be operating leverage opportunities i believe theres significant potential to drive our efficiency ratio down but if you talk to the ceo what he believes is hes got a lot of opportunities out there to hire people and so i think where were at is a to kind of number somewhere in that range and its been kind of remarkably steady over time michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful maybe just as a followup just going to bhg you have another recourse reserve reduction in this quarter i think you talked about that getting to about by the end of the year is that still the plan and then as we think about next year some of these other verticals grow could that reserve ratio actually grow from that level as those other verticals grow thanks pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think they anticipate that recourse obligation continue to kind of be flat to down next year itll probably get down into the range here by the end of the year i dont know if itll get that low but they believe that they think it could get down and call it the 475ish 485ish range by the end of next year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc and thats inclusive of the guidance youve given harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great ph thats all my question operator thank you our next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw your line is open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to circle back to the margin weve talked a lot about growth but not a lot about the margin and wanted to just think about loan yields and harold my question for you is how close do you think we are at a bottom for loan yields i think loan yields exppp and accretable yields around this quarter and looks like new yields are coming out around and so how do we think about where those two numbers converge and how much more pressure we have on that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what ill talk about is loan yields without ppp impact i think were getting closer and closer to that that bottom i dont know if were i dont think were there yet i think well still see loan yield dilution here over the next several quarters but i dont think itll be dramatic catherine i think its a couple of basis points here a couple of basis points there the new lines of business that were operating in they tend to be libor pricing now going to sofr pricing so were not anticipating any big hit related to that as far as loan yields are concerned pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then just a followup on the operating leverage question so would it be fair to think about as a year where we perhaps dont see positive operating leverage as we just we likely dont have a big increase in rates this year and youve got continuing building of your teams and the expense growth but then as we enter thats really the year where you really start to see the growth move off of all these hires and hopefully with a higher rate environment where it will be a lot stronger in harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats a fair assessment i dont see our operating leverage moving one way or the other here over the next four quarters and i think this hiring pipeline that terry talked about earlier has got a significant impact on that i think well have some branch builds going on next year in some of these markets that were new to and i think that will impact it as well so you know from your history with us over the years we manage our expenses but we focus on revenues and weve been fortunate through our history that our operating leverage has been fairly stable even with these big investments catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thats great so maybe its kind of stable operating leverage near term and then we see expansion in which i think that makes sense all right thats all i got thank you so much m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator our next question comes from matt olney with stephens your line is open matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning i want to go back to michaels question on bhg around that recourse adjustment what was the dollar amount of the adjustment in the third quarter i think it was around million in but i dont see anything specific in the third quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ive talked to dan mcsherry about that earlier today it was about million again here in the second quarter i mean third quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that and it sounds like you expect another adjustment in the fourth quarter would you expect it to be at a similar level as you saw in the and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think it probably will be similar but ill have to follow up with dan to find out but i think you should probably count on it being similar matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay got it and just to clarify the outlook for the operating expenses obviously you mentioned the to growth next year any more color on why operating expenses could be flat to down in the fourth quarter while youre still hiring elevated number of new producers harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah matt i think our incentives were fully baked on incentives and i think well have probably a little less incentive expense coming in here in the fourth quarter thatll help kind of neutralize its impact to fourth quarter run rate matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from ph brock valley with ubs your line is open q hey good morning thanks for the question harold just to follow up on bhg you mentioned the reserve going down to about maybe in the next year on the back of that and i think you mentioned this at the investor day whats the impact as bhg transitions to cecl harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question cecl will come around in i believe or and right now what the experts have told them is they dont necessarily need to worry about cecl for the loans sold through the pipeline through the auction platform but they will need to adjust for cecl here in the on balance sheet credit theyre going through modeling on what that means to them and their business model but suffice it to say these loans have an average life of about years and well call it or kind of chargeoff rate that equates to somewhere around call it to reserves q got it okay and i think going back to slide and the focus on the revenue producers what should we be thinking in terms of just basic math on per producer on average what do they add in total or in total after three or four years how do we kind of break that down just sort of rule of thumb pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold you want to take that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brock weve looked at that like terrys expression earlier in the call nine ways to sunday that typically a commercial lender on average based on our hiring kind of metrics over the last call it three years were looking at about million loan get from a commercial lender and then somewhere close to that on deposits so thats kind of what well use for modeling when we start talking about these new hires that are coming to us from all over the franchise of late the hires that weve had in equipment finance and franchise lending we fully anticipate bigger balances from them q got it and thats is that within say three years or is that ph two times timeframe m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold you might be on mute buddy brock i dont know what happened to harolds connection the timeline on that is a fiveyear number q five years okay great thanks for the call terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay you bet operator our next question comes from brian martin with montgomery scott your line is open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning hey i dont know if harolds back on terry but maybe just the reserve level you guys have talked about that going lower can you just give a sense for how where do you think that could end up over time as the economy improves and m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah harold are you there indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 yeah i just i got dropped and now im back brian can you repeat the question brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah harold i was just wondering on the reserve the allowance level just kind of how we think about where that trends to kind of over time harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we anticipate provided everything kind of stays consistent here that well continue to see decreases here over the next several quarters i dont anticipate any significant change with respect to the absolute change net change quarterly change so i think weve probably got more to go call it through next year and its just the way our modeling works so its a slow and steady kind of operating mode brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and currently that level youre at this quarter harold i mean i guess thats kind of what i was getting at would you expect to that how low could that get to if we look to where it was prepandemic or i guess when you think the next couple of quarters or next months whatever timeframe youre thinking about harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think well get down to day one reserves post cecl brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc we could but im not were not planning for that to happen brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so i think were looking at all kinds of different scenarios but right now we believe that weve got more reserve release coming probably through the brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and how about just going back to your the margin harold just kind of the core margin outlook i mean if loan yields continue to drift a little bit lower and the funding is in the funding costs are kind of pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 approaching the bottom and then net core margin probably goes incrementally lower in the near term is that how to think about that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats probably an accurate assessment but again like i was mentioning to catherine i dont think were talking about significant bumps i think were probably flat to a few basis points brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then maybe just the last two for me harold just the with the stickiness of deposits it sounds as though we think about the balance sheet is growing modestly from or is it growing from here maybe not modestly but growing from here is that how we think about things harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were hopeful we dont see billion in deposit growth i know thats not something cfos like to talk about but yeah i think we will see continued deposit growth but i think itll be more like what maybe it was pre pandemic brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay and then just on the fee income harold i mean just kind of trying to put some kind of fence around these equity investments i mean given they were million dollars all of last year and were almost million year todate i mean that if the current level isnt sustainable i mean theres a i guess youre probably somewhere in between a little bit lower than million a quarter but some healthy level is sustainable as we go forward today absent any big adjustments like you saw this quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean we fully anticipate making money off these venture fund investments just to give you a little more detail on it brian weve got about million in indiscernible typical joint venture funds that where people are out there trying to make investments to hit a big leak and then weve got another or so million in cra venture funds that have kind of a different objective so the yield the risk return on the cra investments is not nearly as large as say the typical the million so but we would have a reasonable return target on both segments of our joint venture fund investments with the typical noncre ones being of course bigger brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah got you okay and then just lastly on the ppp harold the balances of ppp where youve given kind of forgiveness youre seeing now i guess where do you see the balances of ppp at yearend and just the i think you said that was it the contribution from ppp revenue is around youre thinking million for the fourth quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2021 yeah some million to million we dont know exactly where forgiveness is going to go but its traditionally over the last several quarters historically its been running about call it down on balances im talking about the balance sheet every quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right in the revenue side the million to million so okay thats all i had thanks for taking the questions guys harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brian m terry
