presentation of the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of the nongaap measures to the comparable gaap measures will be available on pinnacle financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that im going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you matt hopefully everybody knows were going to start with this snapshot our primary objective here is total shareholder return and we believe these are the best metrics to ensure we get that done as always we begin with the gaap measures but for me in quarters like this where theres a lot of noise the nongaap measures are perhaps more revealing this quarter our treasury management team here did some extraordinary work in my opinion to reposition our securities book which of course creates a loss on the sale of securities in this period but provides a meaningful lift to our ongoing revenue and earnings run rate with what we expect to be a slightly better than threeyear payback and it increased both tangible book value and riskbased capital at the same time a really elegant and valuecreating strategy so looking at the nongaap metrics in general the objective is to have all the balance sheet and pl metrics moving steadily up and to the right thats been the case for the better part of our 24year existence unfortunately as everyone knows over the last couple of years earnings for banks have had to recalibrate given the extraordinary impacts of rapidly rising interest rates and an inverted yield curve harold tells the story about two campers awakened in the night by a big bear one of the camper stopped to put his tennis shoes on and tie them up and the other camper asked him do you really think you can outrun that bear they said well i dont know if i can outrun that bear i just have to outrun you and so i hated that this calibrations been required but i believe that were outrunning most of our peers if you look across the top row this quarter you see an inflection point for revenue eps and adjusted ppnr and you see those lifts even as were attracting record numbers of revenue producers and supporting them with incremental facilities the truth is our opportunities to invest in the ongoing growth of our revenue eps and ppnr has even better than we would have projected turning to balance sheet growth im very encouraged by the underlying growth going on there harold will review the numbers in greater detail but quickly in a market with prolonged contractions in money supply many are unable to grow client deposits but as a result of building important specialty deposit products were able to grow the client deposits and grow them fast enough to allow us to remix the deposit book away from highercost broker deposits in the case of loans our current growth rate is outsized albeit less than we had originally hoped most are aware that we began a strategic reduction of our cre as a function of riskbased capital to months ago these targets are currently or less of riskbased capital allocated to construction and or less allocated to total cre weve been travelling pretty fast in the construction bucket its now down to so were rapidly approaching our target layer in dollars our various categories of cre loans contracted million during the quarter which highlights the underlying success were having among our commercial and industrial clients pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 so the quarters numbers have a lot of noise but the strength of the underlying growth is remarkable id comment across the bottom row you can get a snapshot of asset quality while net chargeoffs ticked up basis points in the quarter we continue to guide the basis points on the year with virtually no problem loan formation at this point so harold let me turn it over to you to let you review the numbers in detail harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody we will start with loans which came in a little less than we anticipated as a result were lowering our outlook slightly for loan growth to to growth we believe our growth will still be outsized compared to our peers we also still believe that were doing a great job on spreads particularly for prime and sofrbased credit new volumes were coming in at essentially the same spread as the existing books so were pleased in this difficultatbesttogrowloans environment one of the keys to our financial plan is increasing repricing on our renewals of fixed rate loans as the slide indicates were expecting about billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan portfolio coming in over the remainder of with an average yield of around as the fixed rate loans originated in the first half of our average yields were around so a meaningful increase over prior yields our second quarter yields were only on new loans so we have some work to do in the second half of our loan growth targets we believe for the second half of should show better than the first half interest rate cuts will help some but in the end we believe its about borrowers being more confident about the economy eliminating uncertainties and needing to borrow for growth capital our competitive advantage is that we have new lenders that are ready to move market share to that point approximately of our revenue producers have been with us for less than two years accordingly we have great optimism about jacksonville washington and atlanta by the way atlanta had another great quarter both as to loan growth and recruiting as atlanta brought in some very interested bankers in the second quarter and based on what i hear from them in atlanta they should have a great third quarter we believe we had another strong quarter on deposit growth excluding the decrease in broker deposits we increased client deposits by more than million the second quarter having essentially the same result as that of the first quarter were pleased with that effort as the second quarter is usually our most difficult deposit growth quarter given tax outflows in april you will also notice that weve moved quite a bit of our deposits into the indexed deposit product category almost of our deposits are now indexed to fed funds as we prepare for a better rate environment this should obviously be helpful as to deposit growth we have lowered our deposit volume forecast to within a range of mid to high single digits this year some of that is due to our reducing the loan volume forecast thus putting less pressure on deposit growth we also plan to reduce reliance on the more expensive wholesale deposits this year that said our efforts to grow client core deposits remain as energized as ever what the fed does will obviously impact our rate projections for the remainder of the year but more on that in a second we do believe our deposit beta has served us well here as we are probably in better shape than most as we head into a down rate cycle as we said before we continue to like our competitive position as to deposit rates in our markets since the last june our weighted average deposit rates have increased only basis points and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 that includes the impact of the last 25basispoint raise in july of months ago in my opinion our relationship managers have done an amazing job in managing our deposit costs over the last year as terry said in the press release last night we believe we finally experienced an inflection with a meaningful increase in margin in the second quarter with we expect more margin expansion to come in the second half of as to net interest income growth we are maintaining our growth rate at to for this year we have kept our interest rate forecast at two cuts but delayed the first not happening until november that said given the volatility of the data we could see cuts in september ph are probably the best to determine that no rate cuts will occur this year we still believe absent some really unusual action by the fed two rate cuts or no rate cuts our margin forecast seems to come in at a fairly higher range from here the big news from a balance sheet management perspective was the reposition of the bond book the credit default swaps and all the other actions weve discussed pretty early in the press release last night weve been working on this for quite some time and finally got all the pieces in place to where we could execute and achieve all of the objectives we wanted to achieve we have been planning this for several months and a portion of the increased revenue we had planned to achieve from the repositioning was considered in our outlook for net interest income growth last quarter thats why weve elected to hold our net interest income outlook of to growth consistent more on this when i get to the outlook slide a little later but to say were pleased with how all this turned out would be a great understatement we continue to work on other less impactful initiatives that hopefully will also bolster our revenue run rate so at june is pnfp ready for a rate down interest rate cycle we think our balance sheet is in great shape and wellpositioned our deposit beta was relatively high all the way up we believe it will be as strong all the way down our sales force is set up to work with clients once these rate cuts begin as for credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics we mentioned one million chargeoff of an owneroccupied commercial real estate credit in the press release last night that situation deteriorated in the second quarter thus we accepted the bid for the collateral even though it meant million in incremental chargeoffs our special asset group leaders felt doing so was our best play were still working with the non performing credit we mentioned last quarter our special asset group officers are still working with that borrower to minimize lost content for that one as to our outlook for chargeoffs were maintaining our guidance with a range of to basis points for weve also included additional guidance around provisioning in relation to average loans with a range of to basis points since our loan growth outlook is less this should result in reduced loan loss provision all else equal loan growth is one of the biggest factors impacting our provision and that as we grow loans we have to build our cecl reserve at greater than of loan growth so fewer loans results in less net interest income but also less provision so after all of that where is credit no real change in what feels like now for several quarters our charts from past dues and potential problem loans indicate we are operating at nearhistoric lows which should be a meaningful indicator as to where credit experience should be headed the outlook for reduced rates on the short end has to be a good sign particularly for less affluent consumers and small businesses that just dont have the balance sheet that perhaps larger borrowers have more about commercial real estate and just so you know we begin to add in more information on credit primarily for nonowneroccupied commercial real estate and construction in the supplemental slides our nonowner occupied and construction portfolio continues to perform very well we continued to push for lower exposure for pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 construction our target of of total riskbased capital we believe will be achieved before yearend our appetite as noted by the almost solid red table on the bottom right is unchanged and we dont anticipate meaningful change this year that said we continue to have some interest in high quality warehouse and some multifamily but again let me stress any new commitments to this space are limited to strategic client relationships only and no way should anyone perceive were on any sort of offense here all things considered we like our commercial real estate book i know many of you know this our home limits are very modest we pride ourselves on a granular book our largest ticket sizes for our bank are conservative in comparison to what we hear from other franchises we just dont seek out the high profile bulky projects now on to fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg and various other nonrecurring items fee revenues were up linked quarter were pleased to report that our wealth management units had a strong first half and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue for the rest of the year the fees associated with bank blocking and tackling are also doing quite well service charges and interchange both showing linkedquarter gains of and respectively all in were again raising guidance for core fee revenues this year a range of to seems reasonable given the performance of several of our primary business lines in the first half of the year second quarter expenses came in about where we thought they would after you back out the expenses connected with our balance sheet repositioning importantly were increasing our incentive target from to payout for fiscal year again we are raising target points to the fact that we believe will be better than we thought at the end of last quarter and as you know the direct linkage between our financial performance and our incentive plan is closely correlated and thus we cant raise one without believing that the other will move up as well additionally our hiring was really strong in the second quarter with new revenue producers recruited compared to in the first quarter going into the third quarter our recruiting pipelines are very strong across the franchise terry will speak more to this in a few minutes with the increase in incentives strong revenue producer hiring and the call it million impact of loss protection fees on the credit default swaps weve elected to increase our expense outlook to million to million for the year lastly weve presented this slide from time to time bringing it back this time because of the bottom book repositioning and just as a reinforcement about how important tangible book value growth is to this firm sure growing earnings is critical but as many bank investors know keeping a keen focus on compounding tangible book value growth is just as critical our tangible book value fared well during the rate upcycle as we elected to maintain a bond book that minimized our exposure to aoci hit even after we executed a significant repositioning in the second quarter our tangible book value and common equity tier ratios expanded along with most of our other capital ratios now to bhg as the slide indicates originations picked up in the second quarter which was good news and better result than anticipated last quarter we stated that a higherforlonger rate environment could impact the production assumptions for the year as a result bhg believes second half production will be consistent with the first half this results in lower production targets for in the wake of higherforlonger and a tighter credit loss as to placements total placements were less than originations which was the opposite from the prior two quarters this was by design as bhgs total inventory was as thin as its been in approximately three years and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 bhg is needing to build inventory for larger future orders this year also still great demand for bhg paper both from the auction platform and the institutional buyers theyve successfully accomplished an abs issuance in the first quarter and now thinking the first quarter of will likely be the next time they find another such issuance this is due to competing orders that have been previously negotiated from larger institutional buyers as to spreads auction platform spread did widen during the second quarter to balance sheet loan spreads are fairly consistent with indiscernible all in bhg believes spreads are holding even in this higher rate environment bhg still believes when rate decreases do begin that would be good news for them not only from a volume perspective but also from a spread perspective on reserves bhg did increase reserves in the first quarter for offbalancesheet loans but decreased reserves for onbalancesheet loans there was a modest uptick in the second quarter credit losses for the offbalance sheet business which with the actual expense related to credit loss for offbalancesheet now at on balancesheet losses were up also to so even though the percentage for onbalancesheet losses increased in the second quarter the actual dollar amount for onbalancesheet losses decreased a similar circumstance occurred last quarter average balances fell faster than actual losses which is why the percentage loss was higher bhg believes that they are substantially through the credit issues with respect to the onbalancesheet portfolio loans held offbalancesheet by the bank still needs some time perhaps three to four quarters data reflect that of the current losses are attributable to the january through june vintage credit the news does keep getting better given bhgs past dues continue to improve and hopefully head to precovid levels soon as to the forward look for origination of earnings and as we mentioned last time achieving the same level of originations as last year would take great effort in the higherforlonger rate environment especially given bhg is not interested in adjusting their credit models to achieve volume goals as i mentioned earlier bhgs second half of production should approximate first halfs so as you look at the chart it should look a lot like production levels as to earnings bhg is also anticipating that the second half will likely look like the first half for pnfp that represents a decrease from ph prior results of to bhg always has tactics they can deploy to help their bottom line and increase nearterm earnings theyve exited business lines and trimmed their expensive base the second quarter of did include the loss of approximately million related to exiting their sba business line the leadership of bhg has made several strategic decisions concerning their business model aimed at creating a more sustainable business model regardless of the economic climate the credit pain from the covid overhang has been real but i dont think i have ever seen the leadership more optimistic about the near term and putting all of that behind our partnership with the bhg remains as strong as ever with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks harold over the last couple of years weve been through a liquidity crisis as the fed began draining the money supply weve had a rapidly rising interest rate cycle an inverted yield curve increasing credit costs as credit began to normalize with genuine fear about where the credit costs could go in a recessionary environment and a slowing economy which limits the incremental loan demand thats made it hard on bank stock investors but i believe pinnacle offers an extraordinary opportunity for folks that need to own bank stocks our well documented sustainable competitive advantage which is built on a relentless focus on the work environment in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 order to attract and retain the best bankers in our markets enables us to leverage our bestinclass service and advice to move their clients from vulnerable competitors the result is outsized growth through thick and thin with outstanding asset quality and if we can consistently take share from the market share leaders in our market we can compound earnings faster and more reliably than peers even in a difficult operating environment its how we produce value for shareholders during difficult times and its a way to realize extraordinary value for shareholders when markets turn bullish and multiples expand one of the hardest jobs i have is to help investors separate pinnacle from all the other banks that say they have a great culture its unlikely any banker is going to declare their culture is unremarkable but maybe you can ask them where they rank on fortunes list of the best companies in america to work for you can see on the top left were number no traditional bank rank higher maybe you can ask how many revenue producers they attract into their firm from their major competitors on the top right it looks like well have a recordsetting year even for a long long time prolific hirer of revenue producers but its not just about how many they were able to hire perhaps you can see how fast they lose them because turnover is the number one way to demolish service levels and ultimately damage financials so whats their associate retention rate you can see on the bottom right our annual associate retention rate is roughly and its that yearin and yearout so be critical some wont carve out various pockets of turnover like people they fired or people whose spouse got transferred or people who retired or died and so forth for us its a simple measurement if you were on the roster last period and youre not on it this period for whatever reason thats turnover you can see here thats very minimal and its not just about how many people that they hire its not just about how many people they keep perhaps you can get them to tell you how their clients view the quality and effectiveness of their clientfacing people and you can see on the lower left greenwich associates the foremost provider of market research to banks regarding the commercial marketplace says in our eightstate footprint businesses with sales from million to million believe our relationship managers are literally the best for each of those measurements pinnacle is the white dot on the range of responses for each of the top competitors in our market they understand the industry the best they understand treasury management the best and theyre the best at proactively providing effective advice and if they cant give you answers to things like where they rank recruiting and retention success rates and objective data on how clients view their relationship managers im just saying their culture is unremarkable answers to question like these can not only help you separate the wheat from chaff more importantly they help you understand the likelihood and the reliability of their growth of course simply building a great workplace is not the endgame the goal of creating a worldclass place to work of attracting and retaining the best associates is to attract and retain the best clients from other banks without this market sharetaking strategy it would be hard to outgrow the market and as a lot of folks are finding out undifferentiated franchises are struggling to produce any balance sheet volume at all right now jd power says of the largest banks in the country no one literally no one has been able to create as differentiated as client engaging an experience as we have im obviously excited to have the highest net promoter score among the largest banks in the country but most important is how we match up against wells fargo truist and bank of america shown in red here because those three banks are number one two and pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 three in our market in terms of market share they dominate because of our work environment we routinely attract their best people because of the client experience we attract their best clients and this feels like a sustainable competitive advantage for as far as i can see jd power has quantified the seven metrics that contribute to the net promoter score they are trustworthiness the quality of the people ease of doing business digital channels account offerings saving clients time or money and resolving problems what youre looking at here is for the above median performers among the top largest banks in the country the scores for each of those seven attributes as you can see were in the number one or two on all except digital channels where were number three ahead of jpmorgan so the quality of the work environment and the quality of the client experience we provide is tightly woven into our fabric in a way that would be nearly impossible to unravel its why our net interest income grows at a different rate than peers its why we produce doubledigit fee income growth in our core fee businesses its how we afford to invest in the markets best people and support them with incremental facilities in order to propel our ongoing growth when most of our peers are cutting expenses likely damaging their future growth prospects and so not surprisingly over the last decade weve provided one of the leading total shareholder returns by rapidly and reliably compounding earnings in the table below the bar chart you can see how much the trailing 12month earnings increased over that decade and how the eps multiple expanded or contracted highgrowth stocks like pnfp have come in and out of favor thats one of the reasons why our multiple contracted over the last decade but even with that outsized multiple contraction our sustained ability to hire bankers and move their clients our sustained ability to reliably grow balance sheet volumes even when loan demand slack and the feds draining liquidity from the system our ability to compound earnings growth through thick and thin produced marketleading shareholder value so weve demonstrated a way to get earnings growth in slack time like were in now and beyond that to be positioned for great value creation when sentiment turns when it becomes bullish when bank stock multiples expand and when growth bank stocks trade at premiums so harold let me stop there ill turn it over to you to quantify our financial outlook for the remainder of the year harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry now to the traditional slide on our outlook for as i mentioned earlier weve lowered our expectations in some cases and raised our expectations in others just to recap for net interest income were maintaining the guidance even though we lowered loan growth we also have a meaningful increase in run rate on the balance sheet repositioning were maintaining our chargeoff outlook our outlook for provision is less this quarter given we think loan production will be less core fee income we believe will expand and we have increased our confidence levels which will serve to offset much of the reduction from bhg expenses will be slightly higher primarily due to the increase in incentives the loss protection fee and better than we previously thought hiring success in the end we feel more confident that our outlook given our strong performance in the second quarter the success of the balance sheet initiatives and although the macro environment still has some definite uncertainties it feels like there is some reason to believe that some positive inflection has occurred there as well pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 with all of that we conclude that our overall outlook for is a bit better than last quarter all of this has to be a good sign for were about to start our annual planning effort for next year our financial goals will be the same top quartile revenue and top quartile earnings growth the investments weve made in our new markets and our hiring success even with all the uncertainties over the past few years are the building blocks well lean into as we build our plan so with that matt lets open it up for qa question and answer section operator thank you mr turner sic mr carpenter everyone the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is coming from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning great quarter from you on hey guys great quarter from you on the growth in the core loan portfolio wanted to ask if i look at the slides on the legacy markets on and the legacy markets are not growing and the deposit growth this quarter in legacy markets was lower than how much of that is the repositioning of the loan portfolio and is there some slowing of growth in legacy markets kind of due to either pricing selectivity or just you kind of already penetrated those markets and further penetration is more difficult harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question brett we do think that over time as lenders are with us for an extended period of time their growth begins to contract from a percentage perspective that said we always believe theyll at least be able to keep up with the broader economy and how thats working so we dont lower our expectations for our legacy markets but we do have as you might expect some very high expectations for the newer markets as they start from a lower base i dont think weve got concerns about where we are with our legacy markets and the growth weve got there as you know were in some pretty spectacular markets and were still looking to hire people but that as we hire in these legacy markets as well we will get this growth brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then the increase in the incentive target from to obviously your outlook is a little better lets just say in the back half of the year either the margin nii ends up being better than what youve adjusted the target for the is there a relationship we can think about if the nii is better how much of that might get taken out or taken reduced by the incentive increase if you indiscernible harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont want to get too specific here but there is a definite grid thats produced and well disclose it in next years proxy so youll be able to work through that theres a lot of art here as well as science i think whats driven our first of all ill talk about the uptick for this quarter weve just got a lot more confidence in where we think well be for this year so thats why we felt like we needed to increase the incentive accrual pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 as for the rest of the year should like another of revenue show up or another of earnings show up its probably going to be somewhere around to will end up in that incentive accrual but give me some leeway on that because things do move around as we approach yearend and in the past we have on occasion kind of taken the named executive officers and adjusted theirs downward in order to make sure we fund everybody elses so im talking about gross numbers here with the but sometimes we do we work with the compensation committee of the board to adjust it brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats really helpful thanks for all the color guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brett operator thank you your next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on loan growth the second quarter was a little bit softer and you guys are taking the full year guide down a bit i know most of the growth has come from newer bankers moving books of business over the cre runoff is a factor too but has the pace of movement from new bankers moving business to you guys has that slowed a bit here is that a factor m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc steve i dont think that it really is we work hard to try to quantify things show the math of things help people get underneath the numbers and all those kinds of things the truth is sort of irrespective of how things are quantified i rely a lot on just what my sense of where people are and those kinds of things so many times in a quarter there are things that will cause your loan number to be down you get a few payoffs you didnt expect a couple of loans you thought were going to close this quarter closed next quarter all those kinds of things move things back and forth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 just to cut through this at the bottom my belief about our pipelines going into the third quarter and fourth quarter feel much stronger much more vibrant than they would have say in the second quarter and so anyway i dont know if thats particularly helpful to you but just trying to get you through no i dont think were seeing a slowdown in anybodys ability to move business i just think there are odds and ends there but it feels like to me what gets closed in quarters three and four will be meaningfully better than what got closed in quarters one and two steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it no its helpful terry im just wondering everybodys focused on loan growth and i was wondering if peers are doing a better job of defending share from some of the bankers they lost but it doesnt sound that way from your response m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc it doesnt feel like that to me steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then harold on the securities repositioning i dont know if youve said this earlier but when did that happen in the quarter and can you help us think about the nim impact net interest margin impact from that in the third quarter like how much should that benefit the nim harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well ill just put it to you this way i think we gave enough information in the press release to get you to like a kind of a spread differential on the onepointcallitfourbillion dollars we reinvested i think if you plow that into the nim youll get some we experienced some of that in the second quarter because we reinvested we started reinvesting towards the end of the second quarter and that gave us a little bit of push our nim for our yield on investment securities which ended up impacting our nim steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay but it was backend loaded in terms of when you did this harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we had to make sure we had all of the the counterparty was in good shape all of that all the attorneys were on the same page all of that and so that happened towards the call it mid to late june steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and final question on bhg so theres a pretty notable change in the outlook right you went from up midsingle digit for the year now youre down to could you zoom out feet and talk about whats really driving the change in the expectations for net income from nim thanks pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think theyve upped the credit out i think credit will be the most significant change for the second half of the year from what they thought originally and i think thats primarily attributable to the offbalancesheet the auction platform loans that are out there the pace of those banks submitting for substitution has begun to accelerate and so theyre just anticipating more of those losses coming in the second half of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks steve operator thank you your next question is coming from jared shaw from barclays capital your line is live jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning everybody thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey maybe just going back to the discussion around the expansion markets but looking more on the deposit side is there a noticeable difference in the cost of deposits in those expansion markets are you using pricing on the deposits to really drive some of that and is that also i guess include ecr in that discussion as well as sort of overall interest expense m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think i would say generally the answer to your question on are we using price to move the clients i dont think that we are theres no doubt if youre moving a client from another bank youre probably not going to get them to come over and accept a substantially lower interest rate so to the extent youre moving at a high point in the cycle it might be a higher rate than what your average funding rate is but just in terms of matching all the rates for the marginal production and market extensions versus regular markets i dont think you would find much difference there i think another thing jared that i think is kind of important when you go to the greenwich data in our across our whole footprint all in roughly of our clients view us to be their lead bank and so im only making that point to say it is the same in these market extensions our relationship managers are moving their clients and those clients are switching their lead bank from somewhere else to us so anyway i would say that the marginal pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 production would be similar of course the growth rate is higher but at least as it relates to pricing i would say itd be similar to the marginal production even in legacy markets harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc to just give you a little fact we keep up with new account pricing on the deposit side obviously new accounts came in at about basis points in the second quarter and thats all level every new account that went over the deposit system and thats about to basis points higher than what was in the first quarter so it wasnt a significant kind of uptick for new accounts appreciate the deposit book behaves a lot differently than the loan book the deposit book has a lot more kind of fluidity in it so youve got old accounts that are also repricing but the new accounts that we had to attract to our balance sheet came in at basis points jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats great color thanks and then when we look at the cre book and youre letting that slowly rundown with payoffs once you hit your target of the capital do you expect to continue to see that go lower from there or at that point you would reevaluate the appetite and we could expect to see growth in loans to maintain that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah no i think the simple answer really to your question is we would expect to reengage and target the allocation at our belief about that is that asset class will continue to be a really important asset class for our firm we just felt like it needed to be a smaller allocation in terms of what it meant to our riskbased capital it felt like that was appropriate both because of the economic conditions and just because of how we desire to run our balance sheet going forward we desire not to have an outsized concentration in cre for all the reasons that you know and understand but yeah we havent done indiscernible all the people are still here we have clients that continue to be in dialogue with us about subsequent requests all those kinds of things and so a longwinded way to say yeah we expect the growth to pick up jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks very much m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you your next question is coming from brandon king from truist your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 good morning harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so you mentioned in the deck that this fixed rate lending has been challenged by the rate environment so could you give us some context as far as how youre trying to navigate that and also how does that inform how you think about loan yields going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the second quarter we were down at on the fixed rate originations but they were only about so i think what i need to do is reengage with the market leaders and figure out whats going on im sure there is great pressure from the markets but we still need to i think do better so i think its more about sales emphasis and getting those yields back up to where theyre closer to that call it our target is on the low side so were going to continue to hang that out there for our relationship managers to see that thats where we want to get we get it sometimes but more times than not like the averages indicate we dont but were going to keep applying pressure there and try to achieve that the spreads on floating and sofrbased credit their handles are higher and thats part of time because we believe a lot of borrowers are opting to go to that channel as have a lot of our fixed rate loans theyve moved into floating and sofrbased because they believe the rate decreases are coming and theyre going to try to take advantage of that so what we try to do in treasury is make sure we manage that effectively so that we dont get out of whack from a balance sheet perceptive and quite heavily we feel really good about where we are did i get to your question brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah yeah that answers it and then in regards to the shift from the negotiated deposits to indexed deposits is that move complete or are you planning to do more of that in the coming quarters harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think its pretty much done we kind of hit where we thought our thresholds are at least for that obviously theres a lot of larger clients that moved in that direction we were pleased that the overall deals and the quality of the book didnt go up a lot as a result of that and so anytime you engage with a client about their deposit rates youre always going to be faced with what is impacting more but we were really pleased that our relationship managers held that in check when they did brandon king q analyst truist securities inc all right thanks for taking my questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you brandon operator thank you your next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe just following up on some of the margin outlook just maybe first on the security deals i know you mentioned harold that most of this bond restructure happened in the back half of the quarter but you still saw a pretty big increase in your bond yields this quarter and so just trying to think about if you can give us kind of an indication of where you think maybe bond yields will maybe start third quarter once this is all put together harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think we all see an increase in bond yields that will be part of the increase in the margin going forward the first quarter bond yields were down we had some cash that were sitting in some investments that were underyielding so we believe well see this uptick going in the second quarter third quarter im sorry cath catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay so its fair to say i mean indiscernible bond yields one it calculates the impact of the bond restructure but the billion at better spread but then add in there was also an increase in just kind of core bond yields in the second quarter like more relative to what we saw in the first quarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think thats an accurate assumption catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then on loan yields is it fair to also think that with the billion repricing maybe you get a little bit of a better fixed rate new origination levels and then maybe a little bit better growth in that second half of the year that we could see a higher kind of perquarter increase in loan yields in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah our research would indicate we fully expect to see fixed rate loan yields in the third and fourth quarter to increase on renewals and originations from what we experienced in the second quarter we ought to get closer to those targets catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe just one more off of the margin on bhg you mentioned that you probably wont see another securitization until the first quarter of next year and so what do you think bhgs preference is for placements do you think youll see more kind of auction movement or more of this oneonone negotiate transactions with pe firms harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah for lack of a better word theyve got orders from various firms for loan volumes that are pretty much a bhgs option as to when so talking to bhg they will manage their production theyll manage their placements between the auction platform and these large institutional buyers to try to make sure that they get could they get gainonsale treatment with the auction platform thats what theyre going to try to manage to so youll probably see more loans going to the auction platform here in than what happened in catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great perfect all right thank you appreciate it operator thank you your next question is coming from timur braziler from wells fargo your line is live timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just following up on catherines last question there on bhg just looking at the placements this quarter kind of the linkedquarter decline and then the bidding fires and the funding network that unique buyer kind of declined in the quarter as well is that any indication for broader demand for the product or is there something else going on there as to why placements may be slowed quarteronquarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 yeah first of all i think the market on the origination side has like were talking about these originations are going to be fairly consistent for the rest of the year which i think are down from two or three or four years ago and thats all because of where the interest rate cycle is and timing of the credit bonds so obviously if they loosened up on the credit bonds or if the interest rate cycle began to turn down their production numbers would go up the demand for their product on the bank side and on the institutional buyer side is as strong as its ever been they could probably sell loans into their networks but its making sure that the loans that come into the firm are consistent with their credit underwriting so thats where i guess there might be a limitation as far as growth rate does that make sense timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes thats helpful thanks for that maybe switching over to margin and a nuanced question just on your guidance so the current guidance is for margin up in the previous yearonyear guide for margin is its flat to slightly up does the current guidance kind of supersede that or yearonyear margin are you still expecting that flat to slightly up for the year harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think it will be flat to slightly up ill have to go back and revisit that assertion but i think it will be flat to slightly up for the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last for me maybe revisiting bretts first question on incentive if i remember correctly i think on the fourth quarter call there was some comment made that in order to hit of incentives earnings would need to grow yearonyear is that still the right way to think about it if earnings dont grow the incentive rate should be somewhere lower than harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah generally what we do is well put targets at a certain level that we believe is fair to everybody and i think for this year full target payout was around call it somewhere in that neighborhood ill say it that way timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you operator thank you your next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks guys i guess i had one question around the reduction in asset sensitivity that shows in your disclosure quarteroverquarter is a lot of that coming from this move in the negotiated rate to indexed deposits and in those should we see a nearterm spike in kind of the costs related to that migration pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i dont think theres as far as the absolute cost to interest expense i dont think youll see a big increase at all i think our relationship managers were able to negotiate that pricing within a pretty thin call it range between the negotiated price and what theyre paying today but that is contributing to where that interest rate risk sensitivity table is net neutrality that where we are today is probably as were probably as neutral as weve ever been stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it yeah and thats the biggest that was the biggest quarteroverquarter shift there was that a transition m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes yeah thats right stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it okay great and then just kind of thinking about the cre concentration and the guide the and such i mean its a lot lower than maybe stated regulatory concern level so im wondering and i know terry you commented on this one already but is there any part of this that create or is intended to create optionality if an ma opportunity ever were to occur because to me like the last time you guys really got elevated was when you bought bnc in and so im just wondering if starting at this low level in any way could increase this optionality to be able to buy something that might be more concentrated m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think just on the underlying assumption steve on ma i dont think were spending any time and energy trying to figure out how to acquire a bank i think the case is that our ability to attract people and loan books business is so dramatically good its just hard to figure out why you would want to acquire something so i guess said simply i dont think thats a motive at all the motivation i think there are two motivations for taking it down i think one is we have had a belief that the market was sort of peaking and it was probably a time to have less capital allocated to it just in terms of general risk management but equally important in terms of the profile from an investor perspective it was our desire to get off the screens for people that are highly concentrated in cre as i said a little bit ago man thats an important asset class to us and were going to always be in that business but we just felt like it would be wiser to get more to the middle of the pack in terms of what the level of concentration was just as you know a lot of people were screening for cre concentrations and we just rather be in the middle of the pack stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense thanks for all the color guys appreciate it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 all right thank you steve operator thank you your next question is coming from russell gunther from stephens your line is live russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc just one for me at this point the release referenced commercial loan categories where you were able to put enhanced control processes in place and reduce related rwa just could be helpful to get some increased color as to what portfolios were impacted and if theres the potential for similar actions going forward m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill answer it this way we didnt disclose the portfolio primarily around privacy issues its a fairly narrow band of loans its a meaningful amount its a meaningful amount of our credit so privacy concerns are why we didnt want to talk more about what portfolio it was and so on and so forth but what we did want to talk about was that weve enhanced our control structure and those enhancements are meaningful that means theyre expensive and theyre all going to be able to get that recharacterization ill say it that way but weve elected not to do that but there will be future opportunities in that portfolio to continue to do this with new credit i apologize for not being able to tell you more about it russell but that business line is pretty important to us and its a pretty sensitive kind of group of people ill put it that way russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah understood i appreciate what youre able to share and the rest of my questions have been asked and answered so thank you guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you russell harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks russell operator thank you your next question is coming from zach westerlind from ubs your line is live pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc good morning just a quick one for me on the deposit front you guys have been able to keep noninterestbearing deposits flat pretty much since yearend just kind of curious how that fits into your overall deposit guide is there any point where you guys are starting to think that you can win back those noninterestbearing deposits any color you can give there would be helpful thanks harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah zach its a great question yeah our guide would include consistent performance in our noninterest bearing volumes right now we believe were hopefully at the bottom and well be able to grow noninterest bearing from here weve had quite a bit call it of our new account growth is noninterestbearing so there are new accounts coming in and were hopeful that a lot of that new account growth even though its at that that seed money put into noninterestbearing will grow over time so call us optimistic but we believe well see that number perhaps expand but right now our planning assumption is that its going to be fairly consistent for the rest of the year zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for taking my question m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you zach operator thank you your next question is coming from brian martin from janney your line is live brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning brian harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just a couple of small ones for me just the tax rate harold going forward whats i know you mentioned something in the release but just as far as how we should think about that going forward more of that lens pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we believe the capital optimization bond repositioning all of that that well go back to kind of a more consistent tax rate going forward than we have probably in the first quarter fourth quarter that kind of thing so we feel like well be back at those levels brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so like a level okay and then just on the fee income was there anything kind of nonsustainable in the run rate when you look at this quarter without focusing on the individual line i mean it felt pretty good it was strong across the board but anything unusual in there that might not be sustainable as you look going forward harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i dont really think so i think theres two areas well theres one area and thats in these evaluation of some of these unconsolidated investments that we have but i dont think there was anything unusual there so we didnt feel like we need to call out anything this quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc last quarter we had that mortgage servicing right as income and so thats why the decrease in that line item brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right understood okay and then just the last two is maybe on the loan growth for terry just the optimism on the loan growth in the second half versus first half any i mean the key driver of that terry i guess what would you point to there just given you seem a lot more optimistic than the first half m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think it just has to do with what the pipelines look like as you would guess and as all the numbers have indicated for a number of quarters the principal provider of the growth is new hires so as we continue to hire people they continue to move books and brian you know how that work we make some people move and hoping that they some it takes them up to a quarter or two or whatever to get it done but it just feels like as i say in pipeline discussions that were in a stronger position today than we would have been days ago brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay make sense and then just the last one on the margin i guess given the repositioning i guess if you think about the margin in the back half of the year it would seem that this third quarter margin expansion is greater than the fourth quarter margin given the full quarter impact so just kind of want to confirm that and just pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 kind of the puts and takes there and then just remind us the impact of in a down rate environment the sensitivity of the balance sheet and how that would perform harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think from a margin perspective were just pretty tight on whether or not theres any rate decreases or increases from here we obviously dont think theres any more rate increases but we should see continued margin positive news there going into third quarter and again in the fourth quarter particularly if we can hold on this noninterestbearing deposit assumption and we can get repricing on these fixed rate loans and hold our spreads on all this new all the new loan volume i just want to reemphasize because i dont know if weve got this out very much about these relationship managers that weve hired over the last couple of years weve got a lot of them out there and theyre all in these new markets or a lot of them are in these new markets so we have reason to be optimistic that well see this loan growth pick up here in the second half brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then just the thought of the margin harold the linkedquarter change in versus would that comment make sense as far as the pickup you could see in being greater than the just given a full quarter impact of the optimization is thats the right way to look at that harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well there will be some theres some money and cash at the end of the second quarter from the optimization that will get reinvested in the third quarter in some maybe some higheryielding assets so it could happen i dont know if itll be a meaningful amount of uptick or not but it could help brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay all right thats all i had thanks for taking the question guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you brian operator thank you that completes our qa session everyone this
