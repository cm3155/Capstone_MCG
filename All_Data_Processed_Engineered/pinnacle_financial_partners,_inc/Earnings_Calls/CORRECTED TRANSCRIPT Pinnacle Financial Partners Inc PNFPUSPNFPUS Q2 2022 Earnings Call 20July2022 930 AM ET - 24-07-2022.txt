wwwpnfpcom with that im now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you luthania and thank all of you for joining us this morning for the second quarter earnings call as im confident youve already seen was a fabulous quarter for us in terms of financial performance over the years when the stock appears undervalued analysts will sometimes ask me terry what do you think the market is missing so as i walk through my opening comments and as harold reviews our second quarter performance in greater detail we hope to draw your attention to these five things where i believe there may be a disconnect between the financial performance the value thats being created and the valuation number one i believe managements drive and incentive to alter outcomes is significantly underestimated as an example a standard 10k disposal asset sensitivity model projections assumes management wont alter its main current sensitivity and i get it because weve all seen some management teams just wait for an upgrade cycle for years consistently underperforming instead as an example we got our clients to agree to million in floors alter an outcome that would have been predicted going into the last fed easing cycle i expected pretty much the same in this fed tightening cycle so well try to help investors understand the meaningful incentives this management team has to alter outcomes when situations change which partially accounts for the success weve enjoyed over the last years years years and honestly since our inception years ago number two i think many underestimate the power of our culture i think most everybody would recognize that we put a lot of emphasis on culture and likely say thats nice and may think its hard to tell but many dont understand that we do that because we believe it really has enabled pinnacle outperform peers cycle in and cycle out people less familiar with the firm underestimate the fact that our outsized shareholder returns over the last years or youre talking about the last years the last years the last years or the last have largely occurred as a result of that culture and im personally betting it can be relied upon to produce outsized shareholder value over the next years years and so forth number three i believe many dont understand what we view is the overwhelming almost unstoppable balance sheet and pl momentum its been built by our relentless effort to attract and retain the best revenue producers both in our existing markets as well as the other southeastern attractive markets to which weve recently extended of course you can easily see it looking at the history but im hopeful we can illustrate this power and reliability going forward we believe there is incredible balance sheet and pl momentum already built in as the revenue producers weve hired over the last few years continue to consolidate their books of business to pinnacle number four similarly i believe many dont thoroughly understand the power that our hiring model has on asset quality hiring bankers whove been handling the book of business for decades is the single best mechanism which im familiar to ensure better client selection and better client selection is how high loan quality is produced and finally i believe many underestimate the value of bhg its unique funding model and what that means to the shareholders of pinnacle not only in terms of the very significant hidden equity on our balance sheet as a result of the difference between what we carry in that and what its worth but the power and flexibility provided by our growing earnings stream particularly as many of the fintech asset generators are faltering access to funding is pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 quickly becoming key to success to these asset generators and bhg demonstrated over its long history and as recently as in the second quarter that it has the ability to access funding in ways that many of its competitors cannot now as we always do well begin with the shareholder value dashboard gaap measures first followed by the nongaap measures as to second quarter results specifically i dont know what hasnt been said regarding asset quality net chargeoffs classified assets nonperformers are all at either historic or near historic lows im sure some will say well okay thats backward looking were more concerned about whats in front of us which i get but i dont want anyone to miss this itd be hard to produce those metrics even in good times when were not proactive managers of our loan book and at the risk of indiscernible let me also add that over the last days or so weve been actively cycling underwriting in an effort to better position the bank for a more difficult credit environment which honestly i believe is likely but i think most are beginning to believe that while were likely in for a more difficult credit environment bank loan portfolios are likely to hold up significantly better than they did in the well talk more about some of the marginal tightening were doing a little bit later but its suffice to say our asset quality is in the best shape its probably ever been which is exactly where you want to be if you believe youre headed into a more difficult credit environment as i remind you each quarter i primarily focus on this dashboard because its our belief that these specific metrics provide the best insight into how successful well be in producing longterm shareholder value that over a long period of time theyve been some of the most highly correlated to shareholder returns there are a lot of things that are interesting to measure in the banking business and my suspicion is were measuring virtually every single one of them but certainly we measure things like asset sensitivity and jobs and rent environment deposit cost betas noninterest expense growth rates et cetera but you have to be careful the goal is not asset sensitivity its net interest income growth the goal is not low deposit cost betas its net interest income growth the goal is not containing noninterest expenses its growing eps in fact i dont believe any of those things i just mentioned asset sensitivity deposit cost betas and noninterest expense growth rates would be highly correlated to longterm shareholder value creation at all in fact im not even sure how predictive they are on more shortterm results which ill talk more on in a minute at any rate we remain confident as we have been since the early days of this firm that revenue growth eps growth tangible book value accretion and rotce along with asset quality are the items most highly correlated to share price performance over time thats why were relentlessly focused on these items and thats why i believe weve had one of the highest total shareholder returns in all of the publicly traded banks in the country since our inception in here we track asset sensitivity and deposit cost betas but we really focus more on growing net interest income because thats how you grow revenue and eps my guess is that therere likely banks with assumptionbased models calculating greater asset sensitivity than we disclose and banks with lower deposit cost betas and those that are forecast for us that was freeing really well but unlikely to come close to our net interest income growth rate and therefore to our revenue and eps growth rates through the cycle certainly no one knows the future including me but my experience as a meaningful investor in this firm for more than two decades is the targeting top quartile performance on specific metrics like eps and revenue growth and not only targeting top quartile performance that tie in our incentives to them year in year out as our shareholders have been rewarded pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 so with that as a backdrop looking at the revenue growth in  and over time obviously the annualized growth in is pretty special that dont get the cagr since january of and the relatively stable quarterly growth in addition to rapidly growing loan volumes and rapidly expanding margins was also aided by bhgs outperformance in the quarter bhg falls over the second half earnings forward into the second quarter and harold will talk more about that in a minute but its not the least that bhg is really showcasing one of their model particularly their ability to fund loans at an attractive rate is different better and more valuable with classic fintech asset generators many of whom dont produce any earnings at all and many of them are struggling to solve a funding rule while funding for these kinds of assets during the period of fed tightening and potential recession that likely be more difficult or expensive for all asset generators but id expect bhgs funding to be much more resilient and mostly required for fintechs and truly differentiates the power of their model over those both because of their proprietary online and auction platforms been utilized by over of the banks in this country and theyre standing with rating agencies for asset securitizations harold will review this more in a minute but in addition to running million including the auction platform in bhg completed a million securitization in the second quarter even if its rumored that a number of the classic fintech didnt get their securitizations done again bhg is in no way your classic fintech in addition to the substantial earnings i believe it offers much greater sustainability than most peers and its really the same story for eps generally up into the right of course you get a big dip in as we built reserves during covid and then a slight dip as weve had to outrun the benefits of the ppp as those loan burned off the truth is most point in we had difficult time growing earnings at all due to the impact of losing ppp income as the consensus for us in early january before we released result was the weaker experienced a decrease in eps of and in while we dont disclose our incentive targets including for eps you can be sure that our internal targets in order to earn incentives at target did not contemplate a reduction in eps in during the second quarter you can see our widening margin along with our unused ability to attract clients and grow loans is really the key to our revenues and earnings growth and thats why we also included the balance sheet growth metrics because at pinnacle they generally provide the best insight into the sustainability of the net interest revenue growth weve had loan growth annualized i recognized that some of you may be like me and you describe to all indiscernible and its usual that you might say wow that loan growth is surprising and particularly if you believe were heading into a recession and so later in the call harold will dissect the loan growth in a way that i believe illustrates one is not leading but just the highquality outcome derived from our strategic advantage our relentless focus on the execution of a highly successful organic growth model and our endless building effort since the great recession which ill touch on more in a minute deposit growth slowed in the second quarter which is not unusual given the tax payment outflows we believe our irs statements were measurably elevated this year but were encouraged that the growth rebounded in the second half of the quarter particularly in the dda category harold will provide more on that as well before i move on to why it works that way i will take just a second to illustrate what im talking about in terms of why i think we all should focus on net interest income growth as opposed to central proxies like deposit betas during the last upgrade cycle they had made their first move in so thats the start point for this slide pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 the two dash lines represent the cumulative basis through the fed tighten cycle the blue is pinnacle and the green is peers as you can see the people seemed to bet on cumulative betas with an overlooked pnfp for sure given the substantially higher cumulative beta through the cycle investors that were able to look through the net interest income growth were highly rewarded with very rapid net interest income growth per share through the cycle roughly higher than peers a substantial outperformance and thats because there are other critical variables like loan rate betas balance sheet growth volume growth rates and other management taxes and also asset sensitivity that has the potential to substantially outrun the potential impact of deposit cost betas now setting aside the need to focus on a lot more than central deposit cost betas i will say this for all the deposit cost betas that well see it would shock me if pinnacles betas were anywhere near as high this cycle as they were in the last cycle for four key reasons number one we begin the cycle with a substantially lower dependence on noncore funding which reduces the immediate bidding pressure on core funding number two competitors are also watching liquidity which should dampen the competitive thirst for deposits to that point i heard a number of banks bragging on earnings calls here in the second quarter about their betas being lower than anticipated number three last cycle pinnacle integrated three banks during the cycle which requires a heightened focus on holding their clients for which we just paid a premium and therefore we had an increased urgency to raise rates and number four the magnitude and speed of fed move this cycle affords banks like our more opportunity to compress the beta or retain more of an increase so its my expectation given those four factors that we will be able to expand margins and grow loans in support of our net interest income growth so now i want to move to why i think it works that way while the momentum continues to build so much more rapidly than peers and competitors and jim collins about this concept indiscernible how good companies become great companies and referred to it as the flywheel concept as a result and youll hear in just one minute he describes it this way and i quote picture a huge heavy flywheel a massive metal disk mounted horizontally on an axle about feet in diameter feet thick and weighing about pounds now imagine that your task is to get the flywheel rotating on the axle as fast and long as possible pushing with great effort you get the flywheel to inch forward moving almost imperceptibly at first you keep pushing and after two or three hours of persistent effort you get the flywheel to complete one entire turn you keep pushing and the flywheel begins to move a bit faster and with continued great effort you move it around a second rotation you keep pushing in a consistent direction three turns four turns five it builds momentum turning faster with each turn then at some point breakthrough the momentum of the thing kicks in in your favor hurling the flywheel forward turn after turn its own heavy weight working for you youre pushing no harder than during the first rotation but the flywheel goes faster and faster each turn of the flywheel builds upon work done earlier compounding your investment of effort the huge heavy disk flies forward with almost unstoppable momentum thats where we are back in this firm to take the market share from larger more bureaucratic banks by taking their best bankers and having to move the best clients from their previous employers to us to steal another jim collins phrase thats our hedgehog strategy the second one we revert to over and over and over and over no doubt it was harder back then i still remember hiring larry moore before we ever opened our doors pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 in and then on the first day of business have opened accounts for ph doug kennedy who owns kennedy resin and supply hes a long time client and our previous employer they were our very first client theyre still our client to this day and now the same is rolling forward with astounding momentum in alone we grew loan almost billion we pushed total assets through billion an incredible growth story by anybodys measure our ability to hire the best bankers only improves as we go and our ability to assist into moving their clients only improves as we go in the last three years weve extended on a de novo basis to atlanta huntsville birmingham and washington dc some of the largest fastest growing markets in the southeast were hiring record numbers of bankers and wealth managers both in the new and existing markets weve hired revenue producers since thats a increase a huge lift in the market share moving capacity of those revenue producers are bankers traditional relationship managers we hired in in and in yeartodate through june of this year weve hired with of those in  so you can see the momentum continues to build were not just hiring any bankers and wealth managers were hiring some of the most experienced and most highly regarded bankers in the market of the we hired in  the average experience is years and literally the majority of them are hired from the large and more bureaucratic banks like wells fargo and truist the in those part of recruiting ground is an example which is a pretty good proxy for their level of training and sophistication and as weve seen year after year of theyre now successfully movement of class which i believe means balance sheet volumes have extraordinary momentum which means core revenues have extraordinary momentum and half of that momentum requires limited or no assistance from a strong economy as jim collins described it a flywheel like that produces almost unstoppable momentum and those of you who are well familiar with the pinnacle growth model and through the years are likely comfortable with the growth the idea of hiring long experienced relationship managers weve been handling both clients for decades and having moved those clients to pinnacle will result in strong loan quality based on the unusual approach of client selection simply these very experienced bankers they move on with the best clients and leave problem assets behind all right i probably spare you the detailed explanation on the length of deploying the associate experience client experience and shareholder return other than to remind you how it relates to why our momentum is so strong theres overwhelmingly compelling data developed by gallup the best place to work institute and any number of others would demonstrates this idea of beginning with an exciting associate experience and translating that into a client experience that yields indiscernible doesnt need fuel outside of shareholder return literally times the russell since while some banks are hoping to catch whatever the next wave might be rising rates falling rates whatever weve been diligently building an infrastructure that i believe has and again continue to produce outsize shareholder returns over the longterm cycle in and cycle out our associate engagement is literally among the best employers in the country its longstanding its across virtually every associate group like women millennials parents and across our entire footprint in virtually every major market building on that foundation these excited associates are hiring well with clients our net promoter score is market leading in both our tennessee and north carolina footprint an extremely high ranking in every metropolitan market indiscernible large amount of shares produced and indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 and on the far right you can see that we have substantially translated all that focus on our associates and clients on the shareholder value the longer term shareholder returns have been outsized from beginning and over years 5year and 3years time horizons though our return this year has not been immune from the broader pressures on the sector i still expect over the longer term pinnacles culture should continue to produce outsized returns and then finally one more reason as to why line spendings so fast i want to discuss briefly on how i get paid and frankly how the top leaders in this firm are in their short and longterm incentives ive already spent a little time on the variables that we believe is most correlated to shareholder value now here you see the variables that determine our shortterm incentive on top and our longterm incentives on the bottom which is intended to help you see how the leadership of this firm is aligned with shareholders and therefore they did to outrun peers in the case of the shortterm incentive the variables our asset quality eps growth and ppnr growth for most of our existence instead of ppnr the third variable has been revenue growth it appears likely these where ppnr growth becomes really critical weve substituted it for revenue growth i will say that right now its my intent to ask our compensation committees to return to revenue growth probably next year so these are the metrics asset quality is a threshold venture if we missed the classified asset ratio gap which we believe is most predictable of the potential asset quality metrics in terms of future loan losses nobody gets paid their annual cash incentive nobody so the entire leadership of this firm and frankly the entire associate base of this firm cannot afford a meaningful slip on credit it shapes our behavior in good times and in bad a shareholder alignment assuming we cleared the asset quality threshold actual incentives payouts determined by eps growth and ordinarily revenue growth but as i just mentioned for the last few years weve substituted ppnr for revenue with those metrics of course the next question would be as well how the actual performance target is set for these metrics in general we utilize consensus estimates for our peers eps growth and ensure that our target would be at least the top quartile and then we take the revenue growth required to hit the eps target so in quarters like this where you get a meaningful increase in eps we get an increase in incentive expense and a better reduction in eps this quarter and most likely weve got a reduction in the incentive expense which then serves to bolster the reported eps again a high shareholder alignment so for shortterm incentives to be earned by anyone at pinnacle historically we had to clear an asset quality metric and the actual payouts are a function of hitting earnings and revenue targets that were established with the intent of being a top quartile bank thats completed but its one of the most important reasons in my judgment while the earnings growth of this firm and the share price performance of this firm is so consistently expands to outperform peers over the long term as you just saw on the previous slide and youve seen the measure for longterm incentives on the bottom of the slide disclosure is about how the equity base longterm incentive works and slight modifications made yearto ear if you can see in general tangible book value accretion is one of the most important metrics in recent years and all these measures we have to outrun the peers so its not just getting lucky we have to outrun the peers that makes plenty of indiscernible tangible book value dilution in the first quarter virtually all of the peers experienced substantially more tangible book value dilution than we did pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 my guess is youll see more of that in this quarter and so understanding this youre not only beginning to understand indiscernible in the large amount of excess liquidity if anything other than loans just pick up few basis points of margin winning the pretangible book value and then the rates better than our peers but you also begin to see why using things like asset sensitivity and deposit cost base may be misleading since they assume that no management actions to alter the forecast outcome this management team is literally every incentive dollar for outcome as situations change and i believe weve got a long track record of doing that specifically so where to from here right now its obviously a difficult time for bank stocks the bank stocks in general i think rapid growers in particular in terms of pnfp it kind of reminds me this conversation i had over a good number of years with what is today one of our largest shareholders for years she came to every conference and met with us every time and then i love your stories but the stock is just too expensive i actually said to one time you always say its too expensive but every time we meet its more expensive than the last time indiscernible jump in otherwise i get the opportunity on the pnfp well following one of the previous downturn to bank stocks she tells me that theres a very significant change on pnfp well today im one of your largest shareholders this leads likewise to say market indiscernible now for every indiscernible has collapsed the shockingly near great recession low and not only that but the traditionally wide premium the peer multiples that pinnacle has enjoyed is almost nonexistent and so it would appear to me that this might be a buying opportunity not dissimilar to the one i just described the one thing i know is im not in charge of pe multiples im responsible to create longterm shareholder value irrespective of the cycle and so my approach to delivering on that is number one to focus and pin down asset quality we have to not only are the leaders of this firm relatively large shareholders but all our annual cash incentives literally evaporate without it this is in theory number two to continue to be stewards and refine the remarkable culture that i believe specifically lead to outsized shareholder return is a competitive advantage in both good times and bad number three to continue to emphasize being the best place to work weve become a magnet for talent and are successfully recruiting some of the best talents in southeast and in large quantities ive used this phrase before this is a onceinageneration opportunity to amass talent that pinnacle is uniquely suited to seize number four to continue building market share momentum of this firm honestly it would be difficult to constrain you can see why collins referred it to as almost unstoppable weve added revenue producers just in thats a increase in revenue producers aka market share taking capacity we expect these revenue producers to continue to consolidate their clients to pinnacle while they seem to leave their problem credits behind and with that approach you get a rapid growth and strong asset quality and number five to double down on wowing our clients in respect to cycles over the longterm great places to work produced greater than the returns of companies that are not on that list because they can leverage the associates excitement to create raving fans which is probably the most important in creating longterm shareholder value creation and in fact were actually increasing the interest there believing that as so many competitors wrestle how to deal with covid work from home labor shortages supply chain issues and any number of other excuses we can see pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 this time to further differentiate an already differentiated brand by continuing to enrich our associates and blow our clients away and all thats aimed at rapid reliable growth in revenue and eps cyclein and cycleout so with all of that content ill turn it over to harold to review the second quarter in greater de harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody obviously the second quarter was one of the strongest loan growth quarters for us after following a very strong first quarter and what we believe will be a strong year for loan growth overall as we now target a loan growth percentage of highteens to low for this year loan yields were up in the second quarter due to obviously the rate hikes thus far our loan beta is growing about what our deposit beta has been since the tightening cycle began in march we anticipate further escalation of loan yields as rate increases occur during rest of the year ppp is largely in the rearview mirror one of the headwinds really going into was overcoming the significant revenues that ppp provided us over the last twoplus years the key components indiscernible earlier in the year street earnings estimates for were anticipating decreases in eps for us for this year in we reported million in revenues for ppp compared to million thus far this year our relationship managers have done a phenomenal job in deploying part of the loans from other banks and as a result weve seen revenue estimates steadily climb in we responded to a lot of questions about loan floors over the past year or so and their impact on our yields in a rising rate environment as the bottom of that chart on the slide indicates we have only million of our floating rate loans left so on loan floors like ppp loan floors are essentially in the rearview mirror for now our rough rough estimate is that loan floors contributed some million of revenues over the last year or so lastly as terry mentioned our new markets including atlanta and our new specialty lending units provided approximately million in loan growth while our newer relationship managers contributed million this quarter we believe the execution of our strategy is in full effect and look forward to when we can get a more positive economic backdrop than what exists today as we started reviewing our second quarter loan growth we decided that it might be helpful to better understand the source of the growth so hopefully this slide is that helpful we characterize our growth into four broader segments one our pure asset generation play with bhg advocate jbb and then two our strategic market expansions raleigh atlanta dc birmingham but also expansion of the specialty lending group like franchise and equipment lending and then three what sort of growth did we achieve from our recruiting so this is the growth of our newer rms that have been with us for only years or less and then finally the fourth the legacy markets contribution so all this is net through thus far through the first six months we had experienced of our loan growth annualized between december and june which is inclusive of ppp paydowns which is denoted in red on this slide almost of our loan growth is from our legacy markets while the rest is primarily from new ideas and new people we felt like this was helpful as we try to understand where all of this fantastic loan growth has originated pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 now onto deposits for the first time in a few years our deposit growth stalled we were encouraged about what happened during the quarter once the month of april was over mainly giving us some reason to be optimistic and were also optimistic about noninterestbearing deposits growing during the quarter as we all know these accounts become increasingly valuable as rates increase since the tightening cycle began our deposit rates were up almost basis points so were obviously pleased with the effort of our relationship managers thus far weve never abandoned our view that core deposit growth is a key longterm strategic objective and as a result its all hands on deck currently for the first 20plus years of our existence our number one objective was developing strategies and tactics around funding our growth we continue to like our chances given the significant investments weve made both on relationship managers and new markets over the last few years we continue to believe an aggregate beta of deposit rates through the end of is likely we also keep an eye on what our competitors are doing given they are advertising much lower betas which we believe gives us some breathing room at least currently now to liquidity our liquid assets decreased this quarter corresponding with strong loan growth modest deposit growth and a million increase in securities all of which were floating rate with our outlook for loan growth we likely will not see any increased deployment of liquidity into bonds over the next several quarters as the topleft chart reflects with the tightening cycle our gaap nim increased basis points this quarter the impact of ppp and liquidity had a meaningfully less impact on our nim this quarter and we anticipate further reductions in the impact of these two items over the next several quarters presently we have confidence that we should see margin expansion along with increased net interest income in and concurrently were upping our guidance from low20 to the highteens growth for the full year over the last year as to credit we are again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well and again these are some of the best credit metric ratios we have experienced ever not sure if anyone cares to hear about this anymore but modifications made pursuant to the section of the cares act continue to decrease and were down to million at june down from million earlier this year importantly of our section credits are on some form of principal interest monthly pay with only in a classified risk category importantly given the current outlook we believe we will see further declines in our allowance for credit losses to total loan ratio over the next several quarters albeit at a slower pace than we would have otherwise projected a couple of quarters ago our current acl was which compares to a prececl precovid reserve of at december so as we start this tightening cycle we feel like were in a pretty good shape given the quality of our portfolio currently i wrestled this chart out of our credit officers and the information here ill say is maybe obvious but i do believe is helpful in the detailing our appetite for the various sub segments in construction and investment property as the left chart indicates we have little appetite for the asset classes and the red portion and remain receptive to those asset classes in the main areas more importantly is the information on the right side of the chart i dont know if pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 any of this information blue box is all that moved but it does signal to our rms in the fields or expect more diligence more questions more analysis which we all believe is the right thing to do right now i wont spend a lot of time on these expenses weve had more information on the slides to help ph our builders as always i will speak to dhg in few minutes which obviously we had announced last quarter you can further see evidence of our indiscernible yearoveryear increases in brokerage income of trustee to and insurance commissions of second quarter fees were benefited by increased interchange particularly in commercial credit cards we believe this will subside somewhat going into second half of we booked about million in indiscernible gains in the second quarter based on recent valuation adjustments as companies in which these funds or investments continue to issue capital markets had about million in gains this quarter their pipeline is good with indiscernible we just had best right now as to expenses we are maintaining our overall total expense run rate of approximately midteen percentage growth in in comparison to this is primarily attributable to head count growth in the new markets market disruption across our markets which will lead to strong recurring opportunities and the addition of jbb in additional we now believe that we should anticipate hitting our maximum payout of of target for our annual cash incentive plan we do believe the second quarter total expense is a decent run rate for the remainder of the year and we have some reasonable that we could see ph cost write up some in but the inflation backdrop could wreck that thought we also think we have a good expense number forecasted for head count growth in the second half of this year we will just have to see how our recruiting pipeline remains exceptionally strong further as to capital tangible book value did increase to from last quarter our decision to move approximately billion of indiscernible helped our tangible book value per share by approximately per share at june we do not anticipate any other significant capital actions at this time quickly heres an update on our outlook for for loans weve increased our outlook to high teens to low we are adjusting our rate forecast and now consider fed fund rate by yearend we want you well continue to monitor and modify as necessary given that we believe we should see continued improvement in net interest income this year which should result in net interest income growth in the high teens we still believe our expense outlook for increased tariffs and other factors is in the midteens percent of growth range but given where we are today it will not likely be less than that we are very optimistic about hiring and we are thinking were going to have a modest really strong recruiting year so as the ppnr and third quarter run rate we anticipate strong growth in net interest income while run rate for fees taking out bhg and basing income could be slightly higher but probably flattish and expenses should be flattish for us while provision a key driver we believe will be on growth for the third quarter obviously inflation in the macro environment will ultimately determine how all of this turns out for our group we will work with an intense focus and do what we need to do to grow the franchise value of this firm now a few comments on bhg bhg had another record quarter on originations we anticipated that bhg would increase sales under their bank network as the capital markets has been volatile while their bank platform continues to be super reliable which is obviously one of their competitive benefits that bhg can pivot and perform as a bank network and the securitization network during times such as these pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 spreads on loans sold through the open platform did contract slightly in the second quarter from the last few quarters which had some of the widest spreads in their history with rate driving spread will likely head back to historical loans of around or so the bottom right chart details the plus banks in bhgs networking and just over unique buyers in the last months as you know we consider the funding platform will be one of our strongest if not the strongest platform in the company for a company that execute a broadbased revenue platform as you know the recourse obligation is a reserve for potential loss absorption for the loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter bhg increased their resources grew to million up million from the first quarter while the ratio of the recourse obligation to some loans decreased modestly to as the blue bars in the bottom right show credit loss portion of recourse losses for the second quarter remained somewhat lowest levels in the past years additionally as shown in the supplemental information and deal macro environment bhg also increased its reserve for on balance sheet loans by about million to approximately million as of june that reserve is now at from last quarter these reserves increased through credit these reserves increased both credit metrics remain persistent and in some cases are approved bhg based on their opinion of macro environment increased these reserve positions with a view for indiscernible we obviously implemented cost cuts this year that said we are really pleased with bhgs second quarter especially at the same struggles that other more wellknown fintech lenders appear to be going through right now the quality of bhg indiscernible and we believe one of our strongest attributes bhg indiscernible always looking for weakness in its borrowing base past dues and indiscernible were at consistent levels with previous quarters so their borrowers have remained resilient through credit cycle thus far national unemployment forecast given the confidence that their borrowers should be able to withstand forecasted inflationary increase in the way that allows bhg to better weather in this environment than other lenders in inter space in comparison to other lenders we believe bhgs borrowers are well paid with average earnings being approximately annually they believe in the credit models and their experience gives them the reason to do so lastly bhg had a record operating quarter in the second quarter as i mentioned earlier with the volatility in rates in the earlier part of the year bhg has consistently earnings in the earlier quarters of would likely be stronger as they sell more loans to the bank option platform ever hold along with our balance sheet and to better understand how the securitization markets will behave as you know the bank option platform delivers immediate annual sales recognition through securitization network where theres interest income over the life of the loan as said we were able to accomplish during a million securitization at an acceptable rate of when as appear to us other fintech that we have to reevaluate their business models given the operating environment bhg has very pleased to be able to get the securities accomplished and anticipate potentially one to two more securitizations this year bhg has also increased their loan production assumption for and that ways the banking partnership drove growth in originations this year in comparison to last year as earnings bhg believe that earnings should now represent about growth in which pinnacle required reductions in the quarter run rates in comparison to the second quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 three key points id like to emphasize or reemphasize that gives us a whole earnings growth is now to credit remains consistent from previous quarters with bhg and will likely be increasing reserves based on macroeconomic factors at least over the next quarter or so spread sprint is likely going occurring line with more historical levels as we get into the second half spread remains historically high currently but with increased rate forecast shrinkage in earnings could occur production volumes are very strong and we believe that well continue to have strong production going into the second half of the year but bhg will aim to send more to the securitization platform which reduces current period profits accordingly of note that the bhg anticipate at least two funding alternatives to open up in the near term as they speak to broader already strong orbit platform which we also believe is one of our strongest attributes as you all know we are strong leaders in the bhg franchise so we think a growth with a more conservative outlook is the right thing to do for right now with that operator i will stop and ask for you to look for or ask for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner i would now like to ask a question operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc also just its pretty tough to hear you im not sure if your microphone is covered up or something but its been difficult to hear during the call but i guess on the first question on the deposit growth as we as we look at slide and we see the breakdown of loan growth by different categories is it similar on the deposit growth side and do you think that theres going to be an opportunity to maybe see expansion or acceleration of growth from the more recent expansion on deposits as well m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think were optimistic about what our deposit growth will look for the second half of the year traditionally our deposit growth does come in in the back half of the year so were thinking we like to see that occur we think our newer recruits and our new markets are beginning to deliver a more consistent deposit growth here as they gain some more experience with the firm so yeah i think we do anticipate more growth in deposits from our newer people and newer markets pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then as we look at that through the year how should we think about your comfort level with where the loan todeposit ratio can grow to and also with how low cash can go as a percentage of assets m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we still believe weve got quite a bit of cash to fund loan growth to try and get down to kind of what that there is a chart in the slide deck it shows what our cash balances were kind of precovid as to the loanto deposit ratio we operated this firm for a long time at nearly call it to i dont know if well get back to that level but weve definitely got some room to grow jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then finally from me just on bhg did you see any as we look at the end of the quarter and going into july has the fear of recession or higher rates had a dramatic change in the appetite for bank or on the appetite for paper from the banks is that really reflective of the potential slowdown in the second half of growth there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc no i think the bank network remains active and receptive i think what will happen in the second half of the year is it will get more competitive to be honest and they will work hard to try to get a couple of securitizations done would you take money away from the bank network so as a result the auction platform becomes a lot more competitive jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared operator and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to first follow up on the indiscernible so assuming that you guys delivered the loan growth guidance there calling out how should we start think about and im not going to indiscernible guidance but should we think about that as a more typical year for you guys like lowdoubledigit growth or the momentum that youre i mean terry called it out quite a few times could it be another outsized growth just given all this momentum youre pointing to m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc steve i might stress is that again the i guess the thing i keep trying to make sure people understand is our hiring momentum is strong and as you know weve built well over a four fiveyear period so when you look at the number of people that weve hired since that grows more outside growth in there but dont miss that were continuing to hire and the hire momentum this year is higher than last year the hiring momentum in the second quarter is higher than the first quarter and so i think harold used the phrase that our hiring pipeline is all substantial and so yeah that is what ill drive both the balance sheet growth and the indiscernible growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay thats helpful and i want to drill down further into your response to jareds question if we assume deposit growth becomes more of a challenge for the entire indiscernible i think were seeing some banks wanting to get ahead of that bring in more deposits now harold was your response to jareds question implying that you guys plan to indiscernible your excess liquidity go back to where the deposit ratio was historically call it and then youll start fully funding loan growth with deposits is that your plan harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think that would be exactly what our plan is i think theyll run concurrently but yes we do plan to try to bring liquidity down over the next call it six to nine months but that in and of itself we dont think is the right thing we will focus our troops on core deposit growth and like i said it will be all hands on deck to get that done weve got several deposit kind of tactics in play right now and well try to add resources to that to make sure that we can continue to fund the growth that we anticipate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thats helpful and then on the deposit betas terry you made the point that you thought betas would be lower than the prior cycle you called out a couple of reasons so maybe harold what are we thinking now what is the assumed total deposit beta to be assuming through the cycle harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think were still leaning in on a beta by the end of the year so we still are not willing to come off that were hopeful that we will deliver less than that obviously and so far so good on that front but we also think that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 basis points here in july and indiscernible through the rest of the year as we get to that kind of fed fund rate that were targeting that well see increased deposit rates steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and i just want to understand sorry to put another question here but youre also assuming that your loan beta is above your deposit beta and thats whats driving nim expansion its just not indiscernible yielding cash into loans right youre assuming loan beta continues to stay up ahead of the deposit beta is that right m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve been yeah for sure weve been really pleased with how loan yields have responded here early in the cycle i think our kind of our test rate is probably running so far so every loan thats eligible for a loan rate increase i think were getting it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for all the color harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator thank you and our next question comes from stephen scouten your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning guys so maybe just following down on maybe stevens last question around what youre seeing on the loan side and obviously you guys lay out the slide showing us weighted average yields and then what your new yields are and it seemed like there was a particularly strong move in the fixed rate yields quarteroverquarter is that just what you said harold is when repricing is necessary like youre getting a high hit rate or what do you think is driving the success there because i cant say that so far through the earnings season ive seen that from other banks its really impressive the basis points on higher fixed rate loan yield harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i appreciate the question stephen because weve been talking about fixed rate loan yields and making sure that new credit will keep up for a long time and so i appreciate your comment i hope that none of our other relationship managers heard the comment but i appreciate it because were going to keep beating on making sure the fixed rate loans continue to go up and i hope that we can see that what weve been to be candid weve been a little disappointed in where fixed rate loan yields have been thus far in the cycle so were hopeful that we can still see some more escalation in those yields stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 got it okay thats helpful and then on the share repurchase i think the comment was somewhere in the presentation maybe or in the release that no anticipation of using any of that million but obviously terry you highlighted what you think is another great opportunity for the stock for investors so is there a level here where that becomes a viability for you guys or is it just with all the growth you want to continue to hold the capital for growth not the repurchase m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats absolutely the point as we look at our not only our recruiting pipelines our business development pipelines loan deposit fees we think weve got a lot of opportunity in front of us i dont think the third quarter loan growth number is as high as the second quarter loan growth number but theres a lot of momentum going and so were going to try to reserve capital for longer stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it and then just last one for me is around bhg and im curious or just wondering if you can give any additional color on numbers around the cecl impact moving forward if you guys have any updated data there if i remember correctly i thought it was some of the securitizations would cause a higher cecl impact obviously thats selling through the bank platform so just wondering what you have there in terms of numbers and how that might impact maybe on the bhg side of things harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah its a great question cecl will impact bhg for the fourth quarter of next year so theyll adopt on october theyre running various credit models theyre looking at various call it funding platforms that are applicable to cecl and not applicable to cecl right now the securitization network the way its currently designed would have to be ceclcompliant so well probably be giving out more information on that here at the end of the third quarter theyre reworking their models trying to get them in shape so 2023s impact probably wont be that significant is where they have to go full seasonal model but again i think they will be designing different funding mechanisms with capital markets to better navigate cecl stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it got it extremely helpful thank you harold and congrats guys on a phenomenal quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks stephen m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks stephen operator our next question comes from olney of stephens your line is open m olney pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks guys good morning this is matt i want to ask more about loan growth really impressive loan growth numbers in you guys gave us some good details on kind of the drivers the guidance implies a slowdown the back half of the year and i think a lot of your peers are also talking about a slowdown in the back half of the year but wed love to hear more about your outlook for loan growth at the back half of the year are pipelines slowing just trying to get sense of how much conservatism is baked in here thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc matt my sense is indiscernible a quarter is probably not the best ongoing assumption thats a way with the quarter im not saying we wont have that from timetotime but i dont think thats sort of the expected run rate we think we really did have a fabulous quarter i dont look for a huge slowdown in other words i dont think its really slow in economic activity or slow in market share movement as much as it is just a little more normalization in the second half than what you saw there in the second quarter indiscernible really sort of an extraordinary number matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the expense side the expense is a little elevated this quarter but the guidance was unchanged anything that was at a higher accrual in and if im interpreting that guidance correctly it implies that the expense levels could be the peak and which could be flattish from here indiscernible about that right harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so i think thats what we believe today is that expenses will be pretty flat for the rest of the year was elevated primarily based on incentives and call it the increased earnings that we experienced here in the second quarter dictated a higher kind of allocation of incentives from the back half of the year towards the front half of the year so thats primarily indiscernible matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay great and then just lastly on bhg i want to make sure i appreciate the updated guidance does this now assume that spread that you mentioned earlier was a more normalized level and then secondly what does this assume as far as what percent of your originations will be placed on the bank network for the back half of the year i think it was around twothirds a level on just curious if youre going to stick with that same kind of numbers in the back half harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think they will rationalize the numbers that i looked at and we didnt disclose them but the numbers i looked at would say that the bank networks are probably going to be cut more or less in half maybe down to two thirds of what they got in the second quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 matt olney q analyst stephens inc and the spreads harold harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc on the spread comments youre absolutely right we think this is going to probably approach here over the last half of year im sorry i forgot you asked that question matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay guys congrats thanks again harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks matt operator our next question comes from michael rose of raymond james your line is open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions just another one on bhg so i appreciate all the commentary as it relates to the guidance for the back half of the year but as we think about with those spreads compressing maybe a little bit more allocated to the recourse reserve is bhg actually think that they can grow pretax earnings next year with those dynamics in place i know theyre building out some different verticals and expanding within some existing verticals but it may be a little bit early but just wanted to get a sense if its in the realm of expectations that pretax earnings at bhg could actually grow next year thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah mike thats a great question our belief in talking to bhg is they have no intent to roll back earnings growth in any kind of meaningful way now like we talked about here on the call were looking at growth in so using that as kind of a benchmark i dont think theyre looking at any material kind of change there that said this is the time of the year when they begin to look at and the impact of some of these like you said new verticals how thats going theyre going to be looking at how their bank debt loans performing reduce spreads or going back to the higher spreads in a more call it a better backdrop as for in the economy is concerned but im not hearing anything from them that says theyre going to try and take their foot off the accelerator michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc so if i heard you right and im not trying to pin you down here but 15percentageish range for next year is in the realm of possibilities is that what youre trying to convey m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 yeah i think so ive not gotten any word from them that there will be any less than that but again theyre going through that theyll be going through all of those processes here in the third and into the fourth quarter so ill have a better idea for you in the third quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc got it appreciate it and then just going back to the deposit costs and betas if i look at the spot rate at the end of the quarter it was bps and i appreciate the commentary that you expect loan betas will be higher than deposit betas but it does in theory with a couple more rate hikes a pretty high magnitude imply pretty healthy growth in deposit cost do you think after this gapup that we get in the third quarter that were kind of nearing at least a nearerterm peak and that you can still see margin expansion a few quarters beyond when the fed stops raising again just trying to kind of deconstruct the betas on both sides of the balance sheet thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats right we believe that deposit rates thus far we think our beta on deposits is somewhere around as of yesterday we think that with rate increases coming in the last part of the year that well see an escalation because youve got to in order get to that for the whole year and so were trying to give ourselves some room to operate there on the loan side thus far were not seeing any pushback at all with respect to those loans that are tied to any sort of primes sofr libor or whatever those increased loan yields were getting past declines and so far were getting that getting those yields michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc got it maybe one final one for me just more broadly probably for terry the atlanta expansion obviously impacted by covid can we just get an update there and then can you give us more of an update on dc and maybe what the expectations could be for growth contribution as we move into next year really for both of those new expansions on a combined basis thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think as it relates to covid we like everywhere i think have seen a spike in our footprint we have seen an elevated number of cases in our associate base but i guess im going to say it this way happily there is nothing particularly severe some of the people are getting covid or getting it for the second or even third time and many of them are vaccinated and so forth so the consequences have not been particularly severe but clearly our associate cases have stepped up over the last days or so i think in terms of dc michael how thats going to work you hire the people that are beginning to call on clients that are beginning to book commitments and then it takes a while for commitments to turn into funding but i would say it this way that based on where they are in the coming cycle where they are in the commitment cycle meaning indiscernible legal commitments closed loan agreements yet to fund im really excited about the dc and my guess is over a to 24month period itll be our fastest growing unit were very excited and encouraged by the book of business thats developing there pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc mike last on atlanta i think your question was headed to that basically their first year in operations were the covid year and are we thinking that were going to back off on our billion bank in fiveyear notion as it sits right now i think atlanta could have a really strong third quarter here in this year and so i think our leadership there has done a great job of pacing through covid in a way that still we believe gives us a great shot at being that billion franchise call it by end of or m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc im sorry michael i thought your question was about dc but thats right about atlanta michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc no its both combined i appreciate all the color and good point thanks for taking my questions michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right operator thank you our next question comes from casey haire of jefferies your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i wanted to follow up on the team pipeline obviously a pretty strong quarter here in the second quarter with producers hired how is that shaping up in the back half can you guys improve upon that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think i would be surprised sitting here today if we dont do at least that in the second half but the recruiting pipelines are full i guess over the years they learned you dont celebrate until they get in the seat and so forth but yeah i think simple answer is yeah i would expect second half to probably match the first casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just on the bhg front harold if i heard you correctly it sounds like originations up that implies an origination level a little bit higher than what we saw on the i just was wondering if you could confirm that and then any color on where spreads are in the early going here in the third quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sure casey yeah the growth is an escalation i think it was i think we talked about indiscernible end of the first quarter and so i do believe theyve enough kind of momentum here pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 going into the second half of the year that they think production will go up here in the second half and the second part of your question was about spreads casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah just spreads any color on spreads in the early going here in the third quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont have anything on july but in the month of june spreads were consistent with indiscernible number so they didnt see any kind of significant degradation in spreads during the second quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats great thanks and just last one for me i know you guys gave the fee guide for just a question on interchange within the other line popped up pretty nicely here in the second quarter is that a sustainable run rate harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think weve got a good shot at that a lot of that was in our purchasing power that we delivered to commercial clients we think there could be some inflationary backdrop there as commercial clients build inventories buy things before they think prices go up again so ill just put it to you like that casey thats what we think right now casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you guys operator thank you and our last question will come from brian martin of janney montgomery scott your line is open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey harold can you just talk maybe a little bit about you talked about the liquidity you mentioned it earlier just kind of where do you expect that to end kind of end up here over the next couple of quarters it sounds like your intent is to bring it lower and just kind of thinking about putting that together with kind of the margin outlook given pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2022 the loan to deposit beta commentary but just that liquidity and margin generally maybe just over the next couple of quarters here harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the second quarter as far as where we ended up we probably took away about half of our call it liquidity cushion maybe a little more than that so i think weve got some more liquidity left to go get and i think weve got some call it shortterm securities that were going to call back to help that loan growth here in the third quarter so well have a little bit of june liquidity of getting used well bolster it a little bit and then well see where deposits shake out so the blue bars on slide in that top right chart i think those blue bars will come down some but they wont approach call it the first quarter of levels here in the third quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then okay and then how about just on the reserve it sounds like the reserve coverage ratio drops a little bit further from here given kind of the trends youre seeing in credit quality is that kind of what you guys were suggesting earlier maybe i missed some of the commentary there but just kind of how that ratio looks in the next quarter or two harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc as far as our acl is that what youre asking about brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah just yeah acl coverage harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc in relation to loans we still believe weve got opportunities to reduce it thats based on our models that we use to produce our ceclrelated reserve and we also were still adding back qualitative factors to keep it where it is the one point that i do want to reemphasize to you is that call it we were at about the reserve was basically in half of where it is today so we dont anticipate going back to that level nor do we anticipate going back to the day one cecl number but we do think weve got some more room to continue to produce reserves which weve been steadily doing call it for the last six quarters brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay okay thats all i have so i appreciate it guys thank you operator thank you m terry
