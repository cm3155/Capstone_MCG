wwwpnfpcom with that i am now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call looking at performance in the fourth quarter key success measures like net interest income growth tangible book value creation core loan growth core deposit growth asset quality all continue to be strong there is a fair amount of noise in our fourth quarter numbers so were going to move quickly to the performance detail for the fourth quarter to try to create clarity there then an outlook for to help the model builders and finally ill spend some time detailing why i believe we have a unique ability to continue producing outsized shareholder value as you likely know we believe the asset quality revenue growth earnings per share growth and tangible book value accretion result in long term shareholder returns thats where our incentives are linked to and thats why we show this dashboard every single quarter where you can see the relentless upward flow of those metrics most closely tied to the shareholder returns gaap measures first followed by the nongaap measures which im partially most focused on and if you believe that asset quality revenue growth earnings per share growth and tangible book value accretion most influence shareholder returns which i do then you have to appreciate the persistent excellent performance against those variables year in and year out as i mentioned a minute ago there is considerable noise in our fourth quarter financials so were anxious to get on with those details the most impactful of those items would be bhgs election ph to fund roughly million in originations on their balance sheet thereby deferring the income on those loans over the life of loans as opposed to dragging them into their auction platform which would have resulted in taking the gain on sale upfront significantly increasing their and our earnings during the fourth quarter nevertheless i believe you should be able to look through to see that the core banking business continues to have great momentum so harold lets move on and lets walk through the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody as usual well start with loans the fourth quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us and we believe annualized midteens loan growth going into is reasonable for us as we anticipate loan growth loan yield growth in the fourth quarter and we anticipate further escalation in loan yields in the first quarter along with that we are forecasting increases of basis points in february and basis points in march our modeling indicates that loan yield will be up basis points to basis points or so in the third quarter the talent weve had over the last several years results in extraordinary balance sheet momentum as weve done over the past few quarters were again dissecting that loan growth based on categories ph noted on the side to help everyone better understand the source of our growth its been a huge year for us as far as loan growth is concerned and it works out with the new markets and the new hires contributed to more than half of our growth that said that represents more than just an annuity stream for interest income those are new clients with pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 now new opportunities for ph our all types of financial products were definitely in a broader footprint with new markets but also a much deeper footprint given our model now deposits really pleased to report the growth in deposits for the fourth quarter growing deposits at a reasonable price in is a key focus for our ph current environment we are actively building our deposit gathering franchises around hsa community housing associations nonprofits and others and we believe were making headway with these and other special deposit initiatives our average deposit costs came in heavier at 74basis point increase over the third quarter although we believe we remain inside our total deposit beta guidance of through the end of we experienced an acceleration in the deposit costs in the fourth quarter above our expectations by about basis points competitive pressures around deposit costs are significant so we fully anticipate that increases in the fed rates will continue to add a tailwind for increased deposit costs in average deposit costs we believe may approach ph to in the first quarter of this year as for mix we are seeing deposit move more on noninterest bearing and loweryielding interest accounts with the higher interest products and time deposits our average noninterestbearing deposits were down approximately million in the quarter from averages and even more based on the endofperiod balances our plan will contemplate this decrease to continue at a lesser pace in the first half of about of our noninterestbearing balances are commercial with approximately of that number being annualized over the last year annualized commercial has dropped from around per account to around while nonannualized commercial has dropped from to precovid levels would be around for annualized and a little less than for nonannualized so average account size is still or so higher than precovid levels our number one objective remains developing strategies and tactics around funding our growth we continue to like our chances given the significant investment weve made in both the relationship managers and new markets over the last few years hopefully youll not hear this banks leadership ever talk about having too many deposits our belief is that we have and will fund our deposit growth effectively and prudently maintain the appropriate balance between profitability and growth now liquidity we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our nearterm growth as for investment securities our allocation of bonds was flattish in the quarter we dont anticipate any significant growth in bonds this year as the top left chart reflects our gaap nim increased by basis points compared to and basis points in the previous two quarters as weve mentioned last time a decrease in our nim expansion was not unexpected although we felt like the nim will expand in the fourth quarter by a few more basis points than it did our planning assumption is that our nim will likely be flat to down next year and likely down in the first quarter given the first quarter is burdened by fewer days that said our growth model should provide for increases in net interest income as we enter we believe net interest income guidance with a highteens percentage growth for over is reasonable at this time as for credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well our current acl is while which again compares to prececl precovid reserve of basis points at the end of we did modify our cecl model in this quarter with a more pessimistic assumption set with a baseline of stagflation of and the pessimistic scenario at we continue to have pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 conversations with borrowers about supply chain inflation and how its affecting their businesses weve been all about sustainable credit diligence efforts with the intent to actively identify any weaknesses in our borrowings we continue to have a very limited appetite for new construction whether it be residential or commercial thus the growth of our construction portfolio is limited to funding previously approved commitments with no new projects being added at least through the first quarter of we also remain attentive to our concentration limits in all areas of our portfolio particularly in cre as the table in the bottom right of the slide details no changes regarding our cre appetite from the last quarter in summary our outlook for credit remains strong as we entered from a position of strength so if negative trends begin to develop we believe were advantaged now on the fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding the esg fee revenues were flattish for the third quarter all that said were pleased with the effort of our feegenerating units are putting forth as several units are negatively impacted by the current operating environment in a meaningful way obviously residential mortgage volumes were down this year mortgage ph is dusty their pipeline is building back modestly in the first quarter as rates hopefully will be less volatile when the spring home buying season begin gains on sba loan sales are also down significantly from the third quarter as their business was impacted by the elimination of incentives from the cares act which drove more business to sba lenders in previous quarter weve got a few questions on earnings credit rates and the impact on deposit fees so heres a stab at that we have approximately billion in annualized commercial noninterestbearing accounts our current ecr is around basis points which we feel is competitive at the moment our run rate on analysis fees with waivers is about million per quarter for every basis points we raised the ecr that reduces our analysis fee by to each quarter our goal is to stay in the middle of our competition peer group on earnings credit rates so we have to indiscernible the ecr thats coming but it will come on small ph bites we anticipated to return to high singledigit growth in fees over excluding bhg and other nonequity investments we believe growth we achieved growth for the year we think mortgage should recover modestly in and weve also added some strong revenue producers in wealth management late in excluding bhg and the impact of other equity investment we believe that highsingledigit to lowteens growth in over is reasonable expenses came in about where we thought for the quarter we did see noncompensation expense declined from in from but attributable to the reversal of some franchise tax accruals with some of that being added to the tax line so it was a reclassification between franchise tax expense and income tax expense all in we are anticipating effective tax rate of approximately in our incentive costs also decreased in from this was primarily the result of the impact of ppnr results on a cash plan which came in below target and overall performance metrics on a performancebased equity incentive awards which came in below our expectations all of this is a segue in a few comments about variable cost nature of our expense base we feel like our expense base should result in midteens growth for over as to how we can manage expenses as i mentioned we reduced our indiscernible achieving selected incentive targets particularly in our quarterly ppnr targets and various other managements when it comes to equity compensation which is by the way primarily impacts senior leadership thats how it works our cash incentive plan was always tied to eps growth targets and for it was also tied to ppnr target for each pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 quarter we missed our fourth quarter ppnr target thus incentives were reduced our leadership equity plans were tied ph to results in relation to our peers some are return on tangible common equity some are tangible book value accretion some are pe and tangible book value ph models so its all based on ranking in relation to our peers that ph primarily that we think are directly linked to shareholder value the higher the peer ranking the better we ph do we believe we have a very shareholderfriendly compensation system that is objective not subjective which is a meaningful variable cost component the other elements that bring the variable costs attribute to our expense growth is our hiring model we can always back down ph on our recruiting and have done it a few times in our history i can recall once during the financial crisis and the other at the start of covid both times we slowed recruiting until better understood the depth of the macro environment lastly and as we mentioned in the press release weve got the ability to modify cancel or postpone various events and projects ph and absolutely well do should our targets be in jeopardy of not being achieved on the capital tangible book value per common share increased to at quarter end up slightly from the last quarter our capital ratios remain above wellcapitalized level we like our tangible common equity ratio which stands at currently we are mindful of our tier capital levels particular at pinnacle bank well be monitoring out capital levels as we get into we believe the actions weve taken preserved the annual book value and our tangible capital ratio has served as well and have no plans currently to alter our pnfp tier capital stack via any sort of common ph or preferred offer now a few comments about bhg before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year as the slide indicates bhg had another great quarter on originations second best in its history originations did decrease from prior quarter with bhgs implementation of a tighter credit mark so fewer of the lower credit score loans which are typically more profitable were funded in the fourth quarter as a result spreads did come ph in from the last quarter from to as the chart on the bottom left indicates thats more spread shrinkage than originally planned but as the chart indicate for several quarters in current spreads remain above or near historical norms the accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments increased from to last quarter as a result of a more precautionary posture of bhg management bhgs accrual for loan substitution and prepayments for a sole loan portfolio increased from million at september to million at december as the blue bars on the bottom right chart show recourse losses fell slightly from to at yearend additionally given the macro environment and as we mentioned last quarter bhg also increased onbalance sheet reserve for loan losses to million or of its onbalance sheet loans from last quarter of course cecl is still on the radar for adoption on october we continue to anticipate the cecl reserve to be to but that certainly is an estimate at this point the quality of bhgs borrowing base in our opinion remains impressive as mentioned earlier bhg has modified its credit mark particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base this will have an impact on both production and spreads going forward bhg refreshes its credit score monthly always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing base credit scores were at a consistent level with previous quarters so their borrowers have remained resilient during the cycle thus far in comparison to other consumer lenders we believe bhg borrowers remain wellcompensated with average borrower earnings being around annually pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 bhgs trailing 12month chargeoff ratio has increased from to similarly its delinquency ratio has increased from to although these ratios are in line with early ratios bhg recognizes the macro environment could lead to further deterioration of similar credits in an effort to keep performance near historical levels bhg has made a number of credit cuts to both our marketing and underwriting models we believe that bhgs management team has taken a proactive approach to managing credit as theyve entered lastly bhg had another great year in as i mentioned during our earnings calls this year we have always believed bhgs earnings in the first half of would likely to be stronger than the second half as they set more loans to the bank auction platform in the first half of the year rather than ph hold loans in their balance sheet and as you know the bank auction platform delivers indiscernible while loans that they retained on the balance sheet and fund through various funding options deliver interest income over the life of the loan bhg accomplished three securitization this year aggregating almost billion in volume during the last month of december they added million in new facility with goldman and truist this represents incremental funding available to bhg in a third facility for million was closed in late december as well closing of this facility required more loans to remain on balance sheet than we otherwise had been expecting this facility was fully funded at year end so heres a simple example a million issuance through the bank auction platform could generate anywhere from million to million in gains immediately while going through the securitization platform at an spread would yield approximately million to million in interest income annually in the fourth quarter bhg indiscernible again looking forward some key points id like to reemphasize which are basically the same comments i mentioned three months ago bhg management has responded to the macro environment in a very real way bhg is and will be increasing reserve based on macroeconomic data at least over the next few quarters bhg has been modifying their indiscernible towards originating less risky assets with the aspiration indiscernible production volumes are strong and we believe they will maintain production levels going into bhgs new funding alternatives will grow their already strong liquidity platforms which we also believe is unmatched by their peers lastly a few weeks ago bhg took steps to limit its head count with job eliminations and eliminations of most open positions as well as other expense reductions which should yield a reduction in its expense burn in indiscernible we have great confidence in our partners at bankers healthcare group to deliver strong results over the longterm quickly heres our final initial outlook for along with the comparison of our comments on the third quarter conference call in october we expect midteens in loans low to midteens growth in deposit this correlates to a similar outlook for net interest income which should result indiscernible highteens growth in net interest income our plan for contemplates our nim being flat to down for the year this will also be a challenge and well need be nimble indiscernible fee revenues may be our biggest challenge as many indiscernible are facing more than their fair share of economic headwind while weve had some key hires on several of these areas and are optimistic that we should see a lift from those new associates we believe bhg target will be flat to slightly up for weve reduced our expense growth outlook to midteens our senior leaders are still committed to a strong recruiting year especially indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 asset quality indiscernible great shape early and we believe were entering the year from a position of strength which should be a great thing should the negative trends begin to develop were putting the final touches on our strategic and financial plans for with just as many unknowns now as there were last year but our goal remains the same top quartile earnings performance no matter what ph gets thrown to us with that i will turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you harold theres two things that i hate and i know most of you do as well one is noise in the numbers in my opinion noise just forces the discussion to be around trying to create clarity about the noise and takes the focus off the underlying ability to produce outsized shareholder returns which indiscernible the focus should be the second thing i hate is the economic uncertainty indiscernible forces investors to the sidelines regardless of the potential for shareholder value creation and so i will take just a minute to indiscernible how we intend to produce outsized shareholder returns regardless of whether indiscernible balance sheet more loans regardless of the economic uncertainties that persist come what may its not lost on any one on this call that theres a broad sentiment that were headed into a difficult economic landscape greenwich indiscernible commercial executives as to their view of the direction of the economy going forward their optimism index is simply a net score of the positives less the negatives and as you can see here commercial executives has not been so pessimistic since the great recession the economic headwinds indiscernible commercial banks are widely known and include a shrinking money supply which means a shrinking deposit pool increased rate base competition for deposits an inverted yield curve inflation and ultimately a recession just to name a few and there is no doubt that the banking business is subject to the economic environment but our growth model is more a function of our ability to take both talent and market share and therefore is substantially less dependent on shortterm interest rate movements inflation ups and downs and those kinds of things and we literally have been pursuing this model for years so frankly its just hard for me to understand how our competitors who have not been building this differentiation can either catch up or defend against it it is the classic sustainable advantage beginning with the far right the objective is total shareholder returns here you can see the dramatic outperformance over the last years generally that would be true if you looked at our first years of existence true if you looked at our years of existence true if you looked at our first years of existence and while past results are no guarantees of future performance i believe it will be true over the next years because this model is intended to produce value through thick and thin over the longterm the reason i say that is because we built a demonstrably different client experience everybody says they give great service in our case its our clients who say that and they tell that to the independent researches that compares data not only for pinnacle but for virtually all our competitors you can see in the center of the chart that our client engagement with this firm is literally unparalleled indiscernible that differentiated service is largely contingent on our ability to excite and engage our associates im not going to read you the list but said simply in weve been rated as the best place to work in virtually every market we operate in and on a national scale weve been ranked as the second best workplace for women pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 and the seventh best workplace for millennials in the country we excite and engage our associates so its just hard for me to imagine that competitors whove not been building this over an extended period of time will be very successful either taking our associates and clients or stopping us from taking theirs moving on to the advantaged markets using united van lines national movers study the southeast continues to attract people all over the country i challenge you to find a bank with a more advantaged footprint than ours in terms of population migration and growth and then as it relates to our chosen footprint we operate in the vast vast majority of the large highgrowth urban markets so were located in the most advantaged region of the country and within that region were generally located in the largest and fastest growing cities moving beyond the incredibly attractive size and growth dynamics of our markets frankly the more important traction is the competitive landscape given the net promoter score is the best indicator of a banks ability to protect or expand market share beginning on the left according to greenwichs national study despite all their investments in technology you can see scores are horribly low for the national franchises slightly better but declining at the superregionals and not surprisingly better but declining in community banks moving to the right you can see the pinnacle scores are unmatched and getting better i fully expect that gap to widen as the industry adopts the workfromhome platform while we operate a workfromoffice platform primarily for the purpose of further differentiating our service levels indiscernible thats what well do keep in mind that net promoter score measure requires willingness to reprimand so thats how you continue to grow safely in the face of a declining economy and speaking of the competitive vulnerabilities never in our existence i remember a time when the banks that have the bulk of the share in our markets were more likely to give it up than now heres a smattering of recent headlines in our markets regarding our competitors indiscernible crystallize the sustainability of our ongoing market share taking for both associates and clients and heres further demonstration of our win in the war for talent and i believe weve become the employer of choice for bankers that are the frustrated with the large bank employers in our markets it seems like every year we set a new record for hiring many of the most experienced and successful revenue producers in our markets from those banks that still have the largest market shares and when they work in a company that despises bureaucracy and is universally focused indiscernible clients these revenue producers create literally the best experience in the market not to belabor the point but the three banks on the left of that chart are the market share leaders so how could you expect anything from us but rapid growth over the longterm completely agnostic to economic conditions when you recognize that those banks are where most of our revenue producers come from and you see the differentiated service that theyre now able to provide heres another way to visualize that opportunity banks above the crosshairs have share dominance banks to the left of the crosshairs are least successful engaging their clients theyre vulnerable of course banks to the right of the crosshairs are most successful in engaging their clients and best positioned to capitalize on those competitive vulnerabilities pnfp being the most advantaged against the market share leaders all of whom look vulnerable much has been written about the competitive advantage thats being created by the tech spend of the nations largest banks and in greenwichs study of the national franchise as you can see sure enough theres a strong correlation between clients perceptions of a banks digital capabilities and a clients willingness to add them as a pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 bank provider but according to greenwich in our markets the best overall digital experience is being provided by pinnacle the best product capabilities the best service professionals the best overall experience thinking about longterm shareholder value creation greenwich research has long highlighted the three pillars on client loyalty is built number one value longterm relationship number two ease of doing business number three a bank you can trust over the last couple of years theyve actually expanded to a fourth pillar which is data and analyticsdriven insights a key area of investment again for those largest competitors but again in our markets we dominate all four of those metrics further indication that our net growth to clients is likely to continue and now trying to connect the dots i recognize to many the associate engagement client service add little to no bearing on earnings and shareholder returns some view those things as expenses to be cut but hopefully this slide can connect the dots for you on why we believe our growth should be insulated from economic conditions because of the people we hire and the service we give very few client would consider leaving and a great many intend to add us a provider indiscernible as you scan up and down on those net momentum percentages for the banks in our market irrespective of economic conditions our net momentum is huge in the case of small businesses more than twice as much as the next best competitor and in the case of the middle market total dominance particularly when you compare to the market share leaders the top three banks on both of those charts without understanding our unique approach to penetrating the market largely by hiring experienced bankers enabling them to be easy to do business with indiscernible draw a conclusion that if its growing like a weed it is one so many of our competitors are out prospecting for new clients by circulating indiscernible list or some other prospect list indiscernible to borrow money i would say even slow growers thats typically how its done and you can see here according to greenwich were dead last in prospect calling as previously discussed were not out trying to meet clients to loan money to were simply supporting our relationship managers and calling on the clients that theyve known and banked many times for decades we believe that strategy provides us with better protection than our peers in the event credit turns so  was a noisy quarter economic uncertainties abound my encouragement is to keep the indiscernible as it relates to bhg the fundamentals remain strong originations were the second highest in their history theyve restored their loan book and score has not deteriorated again and gaining strength in the loan book they continue to add liquidity sources and utilize those liquidity resources mainly from some of the most sophisticated investors in the market and at the end of the day nearly million in pretax earnings grow over prior year its an incredible story and continues to be a handsome asset beyond that and i think this is most important to me we run a core banking franchise that continues to dominate continues to have momentum regardless of what the circumstances are we compete in the advantaged southeastern footprint we have a cultural focus that results in a differentiated client experience and there is no more sustainable advantage than that our organic growth model indiscernible that resonates throughout our markets one of the best loan growth stories in the us one of the best tangible book value growers in the country from a credit perspective were top quartile in terms of npatoloans and ph oreo clearly the place you want to start when credit does turn pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 and then lastly i would just hit on this idea that harold has talked about a little bit but i think an important consideration as people begin to focus on how do we get the estimates set has to do with our compensation systems how those goals are set particularly as it relates to leadership compensation specifically those incentive plans focus on tangible book value generation may give you some insights on why our tangible book value grew indiscernible versus peers in with the peer relative target setting so we have to outrun the peers as harold has indicated were looking for top quartile performance on things like eps and revenue growth in as many of you trying to develop those estimates maybe you can go to school a little bit on and all i mean by that is if you think back to generally the outlook for the industry as a whole was that there would be negative earnings growth in indiscernible recall most believed that the industry didnt have sufficient momentum to indiscernible of ppp income but i will say this obviously this information ends up in our proxy but regardless of what those indiscernible are we still targeted top quartile growth which was not negative and we bet my incentive harolds incentives and the incentives of the roughly salarybased employees of this company on that idea thats been our methodology from the start that continues to be our methodology and so if you think through that you get some insight into our belief about the momentum in the core banking franchise in order to get that done so ill stop there and well be glad to take questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and the first question is coming from jared shaw from wells fargo securities jared your line is live jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning guys thank you maybe just starting on margin in the guidance harold when youre saying its down should we assume thats down from fourth quarters or the full year over full year should be slightly down harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we believe that it would be flat to down from the fourth quarter we think the first quarter is going to be probably penalized more because it just has fewer number of days but we believe it could be to basis points something like that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then when we look at the asset sensitivity disclosure it looks like you became more asset sensitive in fourth quarter so is this just you anticipate increased acceleration of deposit funding pressure im assuming here pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean we are planning to still see rates increase here in the nearterm we think our deposit beta might level off at somewhere around by midyear maybe a little more to that by midyear yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks for that and on bhg what are some of the assumptions you have for provision in with the weakening credit backdrop and how sensitive is your bhg outlook to the provision harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question they plan on not nearly as significant of increases in their provisioning or their reserves going forward so i think theyve gotten the bulk of it done here this quarter but theyll just have to monitor what passthroughs are looking like what chargeoffs are looking like to see if they can stay within that guidance jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then can you give us an update on the estimate for that day one cecl impact in october for pinnacle harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc for pinnacle yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well the numbers ive seen from bhg would be about million so wed be of that that would run through our equity jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 okay thanks ill step back thanks for the questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared operator thank you the next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning guys i think terry and harold you guys have said you spend nii you dont spend the nim but obviously some of the optics around the deposit betas can be tough you guys laid out a really good slide i think in second quarter kind of showing you guys have traditionally had higher betas but also higher nii growth is there anything today within the balance sheet that makes you think moving forward will be any different whether thatd be funding mix the reduction in noninterestbearing deposits the scale of funding pressures or do you think thats the story that will continue to play out that yeah well have higher betas but well also have this better nii growth resulting in better earnings over time harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah for sure were talking about high teens growth in net interest income this year and with a margin that could be flat to down but that thesis is how we operate so several years ago i remember on a call somebody asked a question about how were going to deal with this indiscernible margin and that was back when it was down around or so so there is a point where our pricing and our margins get too low for us to live with and we have to adjust but as we sit right now our growth engine appears more than capable of providing significant net interest income growth with this some might say a higher deposit beta stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and within that composition harold you mentioned some other niche kind of verticals and i noticed it appeared in the slide deck that indexed deposits jumped maybe to of deposits from like were there any meaningful changes there in terms of products or verticals there that drove that increase harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think most of that would be public funds weve attracted some public fund clients here locally as well as in washington and i think most of those are tied to some kind of index pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just last thing from me just on that share repurchase the million plan as well as you noted a potential subdebt rate can you give us an idea about how youre thinking about that into how aggressive you might plan to be and what the size of a potential subdebt raise might look like harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mean weve modeled out a couple hundred million to million right now we think we can step through the year without any kind of need to go out and raise subdebt but well just have to see how that plays out how loan growth performs all that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks a lot for the color appreciate it harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks stephen operator thank you and the next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line of live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on expenses so if the revenue environment proves to be worse than expected could you walk us through which levers would you expect to pull early on right whats like first to go last to go and how quickly could you throttle down expense levels if needed harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah there are several things that we can respond to fairly quickly one is if terry believes the kind of the revenue number appears to be kind of will be consistent for the year then like weve done in the past we can always reduce our hiring profile or our hiring plans for the year we also anticipate what the payout is going to be on the incentive plans so those accruals would also come down and then weve got plans for various events throughout the year that could get on the table for complete elimination or reduction or whatever pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 so this year i think given whats going on here today and what we reported in earnings i think theres going to be an intense focus on not only expenses but revenue growth pricing all of that by this management group to make sure that we achieve our targets this year terry has allocated time in his senior level meeting to review those kind of things and so i think our firm particularly our senior leadership is committed to hitting our targets and doing whatever we need to do to accomplish that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey steven i might just tag on there a little bit maybe not exactly what you asked but i think some color related topic as you know in terms of annual cash incentive plan indiscernible threshold we cant make bad loans and win assume we clear that most of our existence the two variables that determine the payout are earnings per share growth and revenue growth that was required to hit that earnings per share growth and last year we looked at ppnr and i guess for a year or two youre in a difficult period where allowances are being built and those kind of things we relied on ppnr indiscernible our board has not technically approved the comp plan theyll do that here in the next few weeks in a february meeting but then anticipation is that theyll go back to performance variables being earnings per share growth and revenue growth and so anyway im just putting that in perspective i get it youre asking about expenses but it does create a great focus on getting the revenues generated which drives up the odds of success there and secondarily the earnings if were not hitting that revenue growth there is plenty of focus on it we will get in here and start working in a different way on the expenses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful if i could change to the margin to follow up on your answer to jareds question and all the commentary you gave about the competitive environment for deposits harold how should we think about the trajectory for nim how are you thinking about it here i think you said down to basis points in the first quarter but do you think its slow and steady declines through the year do you think we bottom out the first half recover in the second half how are you thinking about that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well as far as the rate increases and their impact on our margin we think they will have kind of indiscernible some of the reduction in our margins so in all the likelihood steve the margin is probably going to just kind of rotate around this to call it number we believe all year long if funding pressures and were not able to hit our deposit targets then obviously thats going to impact that assertion but as it sits right now we believe theres just going to be indiscernible kind of be in that to range steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you thats helpful and then finally on bhg if we look at the prior expectations for versus what youre coming out with now where its a reduced outlook for the contribution doesnt sound like thats related to you anticipating higher provisions at bhg is this all related to them just holding more production in portfolio is that really whats driving this or is there something else pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so i think there will be yearoveryear more credit cost related to provisioning of some call it to but they intend to probably back off some of their balance sheeting and send more money through the auction platform this year they think theyre going to have to do that with the elimination of these lower tiers these higher credit i mean lower credit scored accounts in order to hit their revenue numbers for this year so i think theyll sell more to the auction platform and i think theyll also be still adding more money to the reserves but not at the same pace that they did in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay thats helpful thanks for the color operator thank you and the next question is coming from michael rose from raymond james michael your line is live michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions harold i think last quarter you talked about a cumulative deposit beta somewhere in the range and you kind of estimated by the end of this year which would kind of add any changes to that just given the competitive pressure for that longerterm cumulative beta and if the fed does stay higher for longer does that impact that thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont know ive not really thought about or put any kind of math to what deposit costs could look like at the end of as far as beta calculations and into weve kind of talked about beta through the middle of the year of somewhere between to given the two rate hikes here in the nearterm so im not really indiscernible kind of looked at what the longerterm deposit beta but what we fully expect that once the fed stop raising rates that youre likely to see deposit rate creep just due to competitive pressures so i dont know how long we will talk about deposit betas but i think when you get into the latter part of the year and like you said michael assuming the fed indiscernible higher rate environment for a longer period of time that we fully anticipate that deposit ratio will continue to be pretty normal in a kind of a flat rate environment michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for the color and maybe just one separate followup question just wanted to kind of revisit where you guys are in terms of the bhg investment obviously its done a lot of great things for you all over the years and i know youve kind of maybe hinted at maybe reducing the stake at some point in the future but i just want to just given where the earnings contribution is and expected to be over the next year its obviously going to be lower than it has in the past any sort of strategic thought as we kind of move over the next short to intermediate term and how you guys view that business and what the longerterm strategic rationale of the investment is for you thanks pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill start and terry can add his comments first of all i want to say that the partnership between us and bhg is strong matter of fact ill have a board meeting with the bhg folks here in about a couple of hours but the valuation of bankers healthcare group we understand we realize we believe is kind of a part of the barricades on our shares and trying to figure out what that number is important but absent an indiscernible transaction its difficult to discern that said i think we and bhg are on the same page there are there have been opportunities to reduce our stake but right now the pricing is just not we believe at a point where that makes it worthwhile for us we think its a valuable asset we think it has created quite a bit of earnings momentum for us we think bhg on another day could be worth quite a bit of money all that said our opinion about bhg is that a lesser ownership interest by ourselves probably wouldnt be that bad and we should consider any kind of worthwhile transaction that does that careful m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think michael maybe just to echo harolds comments you started with the right assumption i think what id outright say is that if nobody has to be happy we would like to reduce our dependence on bhg as a function of our earnings stream not because were not bullish on the company and not because of any reason other than it just has become where investor conversations investor outlooks and so forth its just hard to keep telling the story that so many people either disagree with or dont understand and so again at least for me from a stake standpoint i would like to have less dependence on bhg as a function of my earnings stream i think to harolds point i think wed be good with that i think bhg would be good with that i think there are there always are or almost always are a number of people who have interest to pursue ownership interest in bhg and so then the question just comes down to whats the price and so if we find the right price in there i think we would have expressed preference to lighten our load some if we dont find the right price indiscernible the investment and what it does for our company and that fuels our ongoing growth and so again the worst case is a good case but again just to be clear at the right price we would certainly lighten our exposure to bhg as a function of our earnings stream michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate all the color thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah operator thank you and the next question is coming from casey haire from jefferies casey your line is live casey haire q analyst jefferies llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 yeah thanks good morning guys a question on the fee guide exbhg just wondering what are the drivers because just to get to the low end of the guide implies kind of a midteens growth from the current run rate on average to hit the low end of that guide in just wondering what the drivers are harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think mortgage is going to be impactful they had a big hit in the fourth quarter because of valuation of the hedge their pipeline is down to the lowest level its been at in i dont know seven or eight years basically but the actual size of the pipeline drives the valuation of that hedge and so we think were going to at least have that tailwind going into the call it the early part of into the spring weve also hired a meaningful number of wealth management people and were particularly interested in a few that have been at this for decades their client base is broad wellsupported so we anticipate some pretty significant revenue bumps from that as weve also mentioned we are targeting quite a bit of commercial accounts and so with that we believe weve got both annualized fees and indiscernible non annualized fees that we commented so thats kind of where that highsingledigit number comes from from primarily in those areas casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then indiscernible on bhg just wondering what kind of spread you guys are assuming just given the bank buy rate has increased and that spread has kind of come in does the guide for assume that that spread holds or is there a little bit of deterioration in there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc spread that im looking at for them for next year is to something like that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and then just last one from me i know its tricky but the noninterestbearing deposits settling down at any sense as to how much more attrition is possible before you start getting into like core working capital and you hit a floor there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question and you need to kind of have a crystal ball to figure it out but the best data that we have that weve looked at is when we start looking at average account sizes and what they were precovid to what they are now and so it could be anywhere from call it or so indiscernible of that but our planning assumption is somewhere around that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 operator thank you and the next question is coming from matt olney from stephens inc matt your line is live matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning and first question for harold with michael roses earlier question you mentioned a flat rate environment and what this means for the margin but what if the fed starts to cut its fed funds rate what are some incremental levers you guys could pull to help protect the margin and the nii harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well we have entered into a couple of swap transactions for about well theres actually four of them that weve entered into for about billion in coverage over the loan book at somewhere around call it so we do have that i think the biggest thing weve got is first of all weve mentioned weve got an increase in indexed accounts so those will come down but the other thing weve got is a relationshipbased business where we think weve been pretty good at being fair with clients and so what happened last time in a ratedown environment is we were also pretty fair on the way down so that takes a lot of communication with clients but thats weve doing that now for all of and if we get into a ratedown environment we fully anticipate our relationship managers will begin to pull those deposit prices down quickly m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc matt i might add to harolds comment there is a lot of energy in the companyowned loan floors and as you know going into this cycle we had a lot of protection from the loan floors that we were able to successfully negotiate with our relationships so thats also a indiscernible matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah okay good points and i guess shifting over towards the loan growth the midteens guidance just trying to get a better idea of assumptions behind this i know the bank always does kind of a bottomsup analysis for each of its producers any other commentary you can share with us about the process for especially in light of the slide in the deck you guys put out there on where you include that the optimism index of commercial executives is at very low levels thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah if i understand the question matt youre trying to get at whats our assumption on how we grow in the face of a declining economy is that ph am i getting matt olney q analyst stephens inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 yeah thats it terry i guess the i know you did do the bottomsup analysis with each producer but im trying to appreciate if there were any more adjustments at the end of that than you typically do each year with your preliminary guidance m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i guess if i get what youre looking for we went through the same process this year that we always do which is both the topdown and a bottomsup deal so again we if you would expect i think we go through every relationship manager where they are what their expected production is their targets as you would guess add up to meaningfully more than what our target is at the house here and so many of those targets were large because of the hiring ladder that we have where weve hired so many people over the last three years so many people over the last two years so many people over the last one year that still owe us the bulk of their book movement and so forth so there is a level of detail that would be down to the relationship manager and those expectations would exceed what we believe well do or what were communicating well do at the top of the house matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful thank you terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes operator thank you and the next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw catherine your line of live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everybody just one small question kind of following up on bhg and expenses so if i just think back to the past few years bhg has been really instrumental in really paying for the build that youve had in the hiring process and building the core bank so at a point in time where were seeing the bhg contribution stabilizing maybe at risk of pulling back a little bit i guess what does it take for you to feel the need to adjust the expense outlook a little bit more than this mid15 range is there a level of profitability that you feel like you shouldnt go below and that might trigger more expense initiatives or is it all just about making sure revenue growth is higher than expense growth and kind of growing eps that way but less about maybe what the roa is any kind of color on that would be super helpful thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the roa probably not at the top of our list we do have rotce and all that but at the end of the day catherine what weve got are earnings targets revenue targets per share and bhg is a component in that and so were going to try to get to that bottom line number in the most effective way that we can if that means we cut costs well cut costs if that means we need to go try to figure out how to grow revenues in some way thats not in the plan well do that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 bhg in the past has provided us some tailwind with respect to growth and so theyve typically outgrown our number year in and year out and thats provided us a little extra resource to go after and support our hiring platform this year it looks like their growth is going to be fairly flat to slightly up and so that may you might imply from that that we may need to back off on hiring in order to kind of meet our eps targets so i dont know if im getting at all your question catherine but were going to eventually nail down what we think top quartile growth needs to be for this firm and assemble a plan that is the most likely to achieve it and that would include bankers healthcare group in that and well use the latest and greatest information we have for them to do it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc if i can just maybe make a slightly different point i dont know if it will be helpful to you or not its intended to at least give you some insights into what our mindset is what were trying to do here i made a comment during the presentation about how the incentive plans work here and really just try and clarify for people that i dont think anybody thought that banks were going to grow earnings in given the loss of ppp income but we believe that we had momentum in the core banking franchise and ability to do that and our incentives were ph bet on that and we did that in fact we outperformed the number because we got benefit of rate increases that were beyond expectation all those kinds of things but i guess i just want to be clear we believe that ph the bet going in that we had more momentum in the banking franchise which would carry the day and outrun the loss of ppp income i think thats different than what i hear when i talk to most of my peers that same phenomena exist this year for me one of the reasons i want to go through the momentum the core momentum just how you get clients and how much business momentum exists its going to occur regardless of economic conditions and so forth is to try to help people get that even in a year when were projected bhg to not be a major part of the earnings growth story that we believe we have such momentum in the core banking franchise which just goes back to the story that weve been talking about for a long time all the people that weve hired all the business that their ph moving all the success theyre having penetrating these large banks that are giving up share that we can outrun that and so again im going to guess thats a different story and so i know its frustrating because most people will easily go to hey it looks difficult why dont we cut expenses well do that if thats whats required but its just not game plan a we believe we have momentum thats going to produce outsized revenue growth and thats the play that we want to make and as i say that are not only mine and harolds but really the all the associates of this firm on that idea catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it that makes sense so youre saying in a moment where bhg revenue is less than expected the core bank is better and so thats why you dont have to tap into expenses but if from here revenue becomes more challenging or bhg falls more than expected thats when you can start to flex the expense lever pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats exactly it catherine ive got about million in cash bonuses in this point so thats all subject to hitting eps growth target catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thats super helpful and then this is really a small knit but just wanted to do it for modeling purposes the fte adjustment typically and ive looked historically typically pops up a little bit in the fourth quarter then normalizes should we expect you saw that linked quarter increase this quarter again should we expect to see that kind of normalize back down in the first quarter like weve seen historically harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and i think thats all i got thanks so much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ph yeah operator thank you and the next question is coming from jennifer demba from truist securities jennifer your line is live jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc harold lets beat a dead horse a little more you gave a pretty tight net interest margin guidance would you would it be fair to say that the margin is probably the most at risk element of the fundamental guidance that you guys laid out for harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 yeah i think so deposit pricing will be key to it we feel pretty good about where loan pricing is we feel pretty good about that our fixed rate loan pricing is definitely improving and weve been beating all that drum for several quarters now and i think its finally getting some traction so the loan yields we think will hang in there and i think weve got support from ph rob and rick and rob around the franchise on that the competition for deposit pricing for us extends beyond what truist is paying what regents is paying what some of these other franchises paying around our competitive peers it extends into what the money market accounts are doing what the high yield savings accounts are doing what the broker group trying to do with folks all that as well and so that point is that you know there is a limit to how much these deposit costs were go we dont think we have to go all the way up to with those levels for sure but we have told our sales force that we will not lose a deposit because of price so their marching orders are to go out there and make sure that whenever theyve got a chance to defend their deposit portfolio they do it and were not letting those deposits ph walk secondly there was an earlier question about ddas and where those are headed there is also a strong emphasis on that and protecting those deposits as best we can we did see kind of an initial thrust there in the quarter that a lot of that dda movement occurred around november and the november rate increases we didnt see nearly that kind of reduction in december and so were hopeful that a lot of that although we anticipate more to occur we just were hopeful that it wont occur at the same kind of levels that its occurred here in the fourth quarter so theres one more thing ill add as far as margin protection that were doing tactically jennifer as far as the loan guidance and all of that we are actively selling to our sales force the notion of prepayment penalties on all fixed rate credits and i think weve been working on that too for the last two or three quarters and were getting traction there so were hopeful that if rates do come down for on us and at least in the near term weve got some or at least in the longer term weve got some protection there jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and the deposit growth that youre projecting for this year would be very strong do you think is this a permanent shift for pinnacle in terms of just focus putting a more intense focus on deposit growth overall m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jennifer i think the answer to that question is yes and all i mean by i think thats yes is i think we have since the founding of the company had an intense focus on deposit acquisition as you know if you have a mature company you got a mature retail deposit book and you can sort of milk and ride that in our case we got to fund it as we go and so theres a different energy and emphasis around that always and has been there since the beginning but clearly during the pandemic and all the influx of liquidity we didnt concentrate so much on the defense of our deposits we didnt have to do that and those kinds of things so it is a different day as the money supply collapses deposit book collapses it does require a different level of energy ph happily during that pandemic period weve built three or four specialty deposit businesses that all have some level of traction in them im going to guess jennifer that in those four specialties probably produced i dont know million to million in deposits for us we expect that growth to be still bigger as we go forward were in the early stages with still positive momentum in all four of those specialties pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 and so thats the reason i say okay yeah i think there is a structural difference in our ability to do this which in addition to all the energy and emphasis of the relationship managers we do have some product specialties that are pretty meaningful in terms of how they are bolstering our deposit growth jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator thank you and the next question is coming from brian martin from janney montgomery brian your line is live brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys good morning ill be brief just harold terry just the hiring outlook for this year i mean i think you talked last quarter about where you thought it might be but given fourth quarter is wrapped up and some of the commentary earlier how are you thinking about hiring in relative to m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think one of the things thats important brian when we talk about hiring most of the time when were talking with investors we really talk primarily about hiring revenue producers because thats really the thrust of our company has been all along what were trying to do is grow our revenues grow our topline in order to grow our bottom line all that sort of stuff but again just to sort of maybe make a point that its obvious but sometimes forgotten those revenue producers are generally going to be supportive twotoone by nonrevenue producers and so the total number of people that have to be hired in a year i think that increases were in the person range dont know what the exact number is itd be in that range for a total associates hired whereas the revenue producers were down closer to i think for the year so the point im really trying to get to with you is i think we will expect a similar year on revenue producers well expect a less we expect to hire less is support personnel in than in primarily because a lot of that support personnel have been in control infrastructure and so forth which generally in my view is a stairstep kind of expense you got to build the capacity for indiscernible compliance monitoring bsa risk loan review all of those kind of things you invest in people in stair step mode i think weve make significant investments in the control infrastructure so its a longwinded way to say look i think revenue hires might be a little less in than but it will be comparable total number of hires ought to be less in than because of the stairstep nature of some of those control expenditure brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you no thats helpful and maybe one or two for harold just on the reserve level harold just can you talk about maybe being a little bit more pessimistic on or terry did on kind of the outlook just how should we think about the reserve level as you kind of go through the next several quarters given your outlook pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah im meeting with the credit officers quite a bit right now they are still having the same posture that our credit book is strong were not seeing any kind of systemic kind of weakness in it and so our planning assumption today is that our reserves probably will be fairly flat here on out well obviously monitor that so if we start seeing some weakness and adjust accordingly but right now we think credit is in check as best we know today brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then just going back to your comment harold about the fee income i guess the you highlighted the wealth i mean when you think about the mortgage and the sba piece in there are those expected i guess kind of in your big picture planning to rebound a fair amount i guess just kind of getting to this number you talk about on the fee income side the high single digit or low double digit growth in fee income ex those kind of more volatile numbers it just seems like theres more to it i guess on some those other items that youre not calling out so like the for instance the mortgage and sba do you expect i know sba was down this quarter same thing with mortgage a pretty meaningful rebound in those coming in the next couple of quarters harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah for sure in mortgage i dont know about sba sba has got some other headwinds but no mortgage should have a better year this year than last year and this whole wealth management investment that weve made should produce tangible results weve also hired some very capable individuals in our capital markets area that ph all help us they have a long resumé of success so were planning on that being influential as well brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and last one harold and ill let you go is the margin outlook you talked about that kind of assumes your two rate hikes if you see a the fed lower rates at all does that how does that change the margin outlook i guess particularly as you get later in the year into next year i guess does that if its not material declines is it not much change from what your forecast is today or kind of your outlook harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we actually have some rate ph increases in november and december in our forecast right now but they are pretty much inconsequential brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thanks for taking the questions
