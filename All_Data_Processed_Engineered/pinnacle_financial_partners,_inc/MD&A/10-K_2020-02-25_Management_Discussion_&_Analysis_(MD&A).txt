item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition at december and and our results of operations for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein overview general our fully diluted net income per common share for the year ended december was compared to fully diluted net income per common share of and for the years ended december and respectively at december loans had increased by billion as compared to december the comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by the acquisitions we have completed as well as the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act in december in each case as discussed below acquisitions we acquired bnc bancorp and its wholly owned bank subsidiary bank of north carolina together bnc on june at acquisition date bncs net assets were fair valued at million including loans valued at billion and deposits valued at billion this acquisition expanded our footprint into the carolinas and virginia each holder of bnc common stock including restricted shares received  of pinnacle financials common stock for each share of bnc common stock held by each shareholder on the closing date we issued  of common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately related to fractional shares to the bnc shareholders included in the common stock issued were assumed shares of unvested restricted stock that continued to vest in accordance with their original contractual terms the fair value of these awards was million with million attributable to precombination services provided by the recipients prior to the merger that accordingly was included as merger consideration we acquired all of the outstanding stock of advocate capital inc advocate capital on july for a cash price of million advocate capitals million of indebtedness at the acquisition date was also paid off in connection with consummation of the acquisition advocate capital is a finance firm headquartered in nashville tn which supports the financial needs of legal firms through both case expense financing and working capital lines of credit at the acquisition date advocate capitals net assets were initially recorded at a fair value of approximately million consisting mainly of loans receivable the purchase price allocations for the acquisition of advocate capital are preliminary and will be finalized upon the receipt of final valuations on certain assets and liabilities tax cuts and jobs act on december the tax act was signed into law among other items the tax act reduced the corporate statutory federal tax rate from to which resulted in a reduction of our blended statutory tax rate from in to in and as a result of such decrease we recognized a charge of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets results of operations our net interest income increased to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in as compared to was largely the result of organic loan growth our acquisition of bnc favorably impacted our loan growth when comparing to the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for was compared to and for and respectively our provision for loan losses was million for compared to million in and million in provision expense for the year ended december when compared to the comparable periods in and was primarily impacted by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio and by our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included chargeoffs of certain loans our net chargeoffs were million during compared to million in and million in our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from at december to at december the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense related to organic loan growth noninterest income for compared to increased by million or noninterest income for compared to increased by million or the increase in noninterest income from to and to was largely due to an increase in income from our investment in bankers healthcare group llc bhg which was million for the year ended table of contents december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively and for to the consummation of the bnc merger outside of our investment in bhg and the bnc merger increases in noninterest income in both comparable periods was attributable to increased transaction accounts and increased production in our feebased products such as investments insurance and trust resulting primarily from organic growth noninterest income was also impacted during the year ended december by a million in net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities compared to a million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in and an million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in each period in preparation for changes in the yield curve during those periods noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or the majority of the increase was attributable to salaries and employee benefits expense which increased million primarily resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of as well as the increase in our associate base with our continued hiring of experienced bankers throughout our footprint during the period expenses associated with our annual cash incentive plan were also higher in than in as we paid out incentives at of target as compared to targetlevel payouts in we also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs of million in versus this change was in part due to a million noncash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint additionally we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our technology infrastructure during we incurred no mergerrelated expenses compared to million during as we finalized the acquisition cultural and technological integration of bnc noninterest expense for compared to increased by million or primarily due to the inclusion of our expanded footprint in the carolinas and virginia for all of compared to just over six months of operations in with the exception of oreo and mergerrelated expenses we realized increases in all noninterest expense categories in when compared to salaries and employee benefits expense increased million primarily resulting from annual merit increases awarded in the first quarter of as well as the increase in our associate base primarily as a result of our merger with bnc including their participation in the annual incentive program as compared to and continued hiring of experienced bankers throughout our footprint we also realized increases in equipment and occupancy costs of million in versus due to our expanded footprint additionally other noninterest expense which includes deposit and lending related expenses investment and trust sales expenses and administrative expenses increased million in compared to offsetting these increases was a decrease in mergerrelated expenses of million in compared to there were no mergerrelated expenses recorded in the second half of the number of fulltime equivalent employees increased from at december to at december and at december during the three years ended december and we recorded income tax expense of million million and million respectively income tax expense for was impacted by the reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate from to as a result of the tax act which was signed into law in december the tax act also impacted income tax expense for the year ended december as our deferred tax assets were revalued as a result of such rate change resulting in a charge of million our effective tax rate for the years ended december and was and respectively our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and for the three years ended december and respectively the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue the efficiency ratio for the year ended december compared to the same period in was negatively impacted by losses on the sale of our nonprime automobile portfolio the writedown of facilities and land acquired in the bnc acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion and a noncash impairment charge related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint during the year ended december net gains and losses on sales of securities impacted our efficiency ratios in each of and increased revenue from increased interest earning assets in the period over the and periods and the absence of mergerrelated expenses in positively impacted our efficiency ratio in the period when compared to and periods the efficiency ratio improved in as compared to primarily due to the completion in of the integration and technology conversion associated with the acquisition of bnc and the growth in interest earning assets net income for was million compared to million in net income for and million in net income in fullydiluted net income per common share was for compared to for and for net income and fullydiluted net income per common share in were each significantly and negatively impacted by the million charge resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets following the passage of the tax act while net income and fullydiluted net income per common share in and each benefited from the reduced rate under the tax act and continued organic growth net income per common share was also positively impacted in and by the share repurchase program we commenced in the fourth quarter of table of contents financial condition our loan balances increased by billion during both and the increase in our outstanding loan balances during both and is largely due to the continued economic growth in our core markets increases in the number of relationship managers primarily in our commercial lending program and increased focus on attracting new customers to our company total deposits increased from billion at december to billion at december within our deposits the ratio of core funding to total deposits decreased from at december to at december we believe we have hired experienced relationship managers that have significant client portfolios and longstanding reputations within the communities we serve as such we believe they will attract more relationship managers to our firm as well as loans and deposits from new and existing smalland middlemarket clients particularly if the economies in our principal markets continue to expand capital and liquidity at december and our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations from time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary at december we had approximately million of cash at the holding company which could be used to support our bank we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank including an established line of credit with another bank that can be utilized to provide up to million of additional capital support to pinnacle bank if needed on november pinnacle financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of pinnacle financials outstanding common stock and on october the board approved an additional million of repurchase authorization the current repurchase program expires on march with the additional million authorization expiring on december we repurchased  of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in compared to  of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in critical accounting estimates the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with us generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry in connection with the application of those principles we have made judgments and estimates which in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses and the assessment of impairment of goodwill has been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations allowance for loan losses allowance our management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of the loan portfolio loan loss experience asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan including the timing of future payment the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio economic conditions industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans but the entire allowance is available for any loan that in managements judgment is deemed to be uncollectible our allowance for loan loss assessment methodology was modified during the year ended december to i extend the lookback period from quarters to a period beginning january to better capture the risk associated with this extended economic cycle ii eliminate the use of risk ratings in the calculation of the loss rate and instead focus on loss rate by loan type and iii expand the economic variables used in the qualitative assessment to incorporate our expanded footprint we also eliminated the use of a loss emergence period in light of the minimal population of losses available to evaluate that were previously being extrapolated to the full population of loans and shifted the focus of our analysis to more of a quantitative model there was no material impact on the adoption of the change in the allowance for loan loss assessment methodology our allowance for loan losses is composed of the result of two independent analyses pursuant to the provisions of asc loss contingencies and asc receivables the asc analysis is intended to quantify the inherent risks in our performing loan portfolio the asc analysis includes a loanbyloan analysis of impaired loans including those reported as nonaccrual troubleddebt restructurings and purchase credit impaired in assessing the adequacy of the allowance we also consider the results of our ongoing independent loan review process we undertake this process both to ascertain those loans in the portfolio with elevated credit risk and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio our loan review process includes the judgment of management independent table of contents internal loan reviewers and reviews that may have been conducted by thirdparty reviewers primarily regulatory examiners we incorporate relevant loan review results in the allowance the asc component of the allowance for loan losses begins with a historical loss rate calculation for each loan pool with similar risk characteristics the losses realized over a rolling fourquarter cycle are utilized to determine an annual loss rate for each loan pool for each quarterend in our lookback period the lookback period in our loss rate calculation begins with january as we believe the period from january to present is more representative of this economic cycle the loss rates for each category are then averaged and applied to the end of period loan portfolio balances to determine estimated losses the loss rates provide a quantitative estimate of credit losses inherent in our end of period loan portfolio based on our actual loss experience the estimated loan loss allocation for all loan segments also considers managements estimate of probable losses for a number of qualitative factors that have not been considered in the quantitative analysis the qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management but measured by objective measurements period over period the data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources the current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time the resulting factor is applied to the nonimpaired loan portfolio this amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist but have not yet been identified either in our risk rating or impairment process as of the balance sheet date and is based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations policy exceptions economic conditions associate retention independent loan review results collateral considerations credit quality competition and regulatory requirements enterprise wide risk assessments and peer group credit quality the qualitative allowance allocation as determined by the processes noted above is increased or decreased for each loan segment based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors the allowance for loan losses for purchased loans is calculated similarly to that utilized for our legacy loans our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses for purchased loans to any remaining fair value adjustment on a loanbyloan basis if the computed allowance is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a provision for loan losses the asc portion of the allowance also includes a small unallocated component we believe that the unallocated amount is warranted for inherent factors that cannot be practically assigned to individual loan categories such as the imprecision in the overall loss allocation measurement process the subjectivity risk of not considering all relevant environmental categories and related measurements and imprecision in our credit risk ratings process the appropriateness of the unallocated component of the allowance is assessed each quarter end based upon changes in the overall business environment not otherwise captured the impaired loan allowance is determined pursuant to asc loans are impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means collecting all interest and principal payments of a loan as scheduled in the loan agreement this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change loan losses are charged off when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely a loan may be partially chargedoff after a confirming event has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely an impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan recorded investment in the loan is the principal balance plus any accrued interest net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount the impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses and is a component of the allowance loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral dependent at the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposal costs if the loan is collateral dependent the principal balance of the loan is chargedoff in an amount equal to the impairment measurement the fair value of collateral dependent loans is derived primarily from collateral appraisals performed by independent thirdparty appraisers management believes it follows appropriate accounting and regulatory guidance in determining impairment and accrual status of impaired loans this analysis is completed for all individual loans greater than million the resulting allowance percentage by segment adjusted for specific trends identified if applicable is then applied to the remaining population of impaired loans pursuant to the guidance set forth in asu a creditors determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring the above impairment methodology is also applied to those loans identified as troubled debt restructurings we then test the resulting allowance by comparing the balance in the allowance to historical trends and industry and peer information our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed including the results of our testing and decides on the appropriateness of the balance of the allowance in its entirety the audit committee of our board of directors approves the allowance for loan loss policy annually and reviews the methodology and approves the resultant allowance prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information table of contents while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators they are necessarily approximate and inherently imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local national and international economy a local real estate market or particular industry conditions which may materially negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses effective january we adopted asu financial instruments measurement of current expected credit losses on financial instruments cecl which will modify the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model as discussed more fully under part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies of this report impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired asc intangibles goodwill and other provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines it is necessary or if a qualitative assessment is not performed it is required to perform a twostep goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any if based on a qualitative assessment an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required the results of our qualitative assessment as of september our annual assessment date indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was more than its carrying value and accordingly the twostep goodwill impairment test was not performed should our common stock experience a sustained price decline or other impairment indicators become known additional impairment testing of goodwill may be required should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has become impaired then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made while we believe that the assumptions utilized in our testing were appropriate they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include the following a change in the control premium being realized in the market or a meaningful change in the number of mergers and acquisitions occurring the amount of expense savings that may be realized in an acquisition scenario significant fluctuations in our assetliability balances or the composition of our balance sheet a change in the overall valuation of the stock market specifically bank stocks performance of southeast us banks and pinnacle financials performance relative to peers changing these assumptions or any other key assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of goodwill impairment if any results

the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of for the year ended december we recorded net interest income of approximately million which resulted in a net interest margin of these increases in net interest income were attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio due to our merger with bnc organic growth and changes in the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets offset in part by increases in the volume and the rates we pay on deposits and our other funding sources the following table sets forth the amount of our average balances interest income or interest expense for

for the period for the year ended december our net interest spread was while the net interest margin was compared to a net interest spread of for the year ended december and for the year ended december and a net interest margin of and respectively although our net interest margin was positively impacted by yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio these increases were offset by increases in our total funding costs and declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting during the year ended december our earning asset yield increased by basis points and basis points from the years ended december and respectively while total funding rates increased by basis points and basis points compared to the years ended december and respectively the increase in our funding costs was primarily caused by changes in the rate environment throughout all three periods presented intense competition and increased use of and associated borrowing costs for noncore funding the application of fair value accounting on the bnc accounts we acquired in our merger also positively impacted our net interest margin in and but will continue to become less impactful in future periods we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our margins we anticipate that this challenging competitive environment will continue during we also expect the positive impact of purchase accounting on our net interest income will lessen in future periods which will negatively affect our net interest margin in we have sought to mitigate much of the negative impact that reductions in shortterm interest rates would have on our net interest margin through restructuring a portion of our investment securities portfolio purchasing loan interest rate floors and unwinding fixedtofloating loan interest rate swaps during however our net interest margin could be additionally impacted by future interest rate cuts if we are not able to lower deposit rates at a pace necessary to offset declines in our earning asset yields we seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits but will utilize noncore funding to fund shortfalls if any to the extent that our dependence on noncore funding sources increases during our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits rate and volume analysis net interest income increased by million between the years ended december and and by million between the years ended december

times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume the change attributed to rates and volumes change in rate times change in volume is considered above as a change in volume provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that in managements evaluation we believe to be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans the provision for loan losses amounted to approximately million million and million for the years ended december and respectively impacting the provision for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors including the change in outstanding loan balances the level of chargeoffs and recoveries the changes in the amount of impaired loans results of regulatory examinations credit quality comparison to peer banks the industry at large economic conditions both in our market areas and more broadly and ultimately the results of our quarterly assessment of the inherent risks of our loan portfolio including past loan loss experience provision expense for the year ended december decreased as compared to and increased in as compared to both the decrease in as compared to and the increase in as compared to were primarily impacted by organic growth in our loan portfolio and by our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included chargeoffs realized in our consumer portfolio primarily related to nonprime automobile loans and losses on loans to commercial borrowers in a variety of industries our allowance for loan losses is adjusted to an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio based on our allowance for loan loss methodology our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans increased from at december to at december the slight increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense associated with organic loan growth as our acquired loans with remaining purchase accounting discounts associated with them are becoming less impactful to our portfolio mix the absolute level of our allowance for loan losses is largely driven by continued favorable credit experience in our portfolios and we believe it is supported by the strong economies present in markets in which we currently operate noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth while investment services fees from the origination of mortgage loans swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect market conditions and fluctuate from period to period the following is our noninterest income for the years ended december and in thousands table start years ended december percent

loan sales gain on other equity investments other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income table end table of contents the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in compared to and is primarily related to increased analysis fees due to an increase in the volume and number of commercial checking accounts resulting from organic growth in this product income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income for the year ended december commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank were million compared to million at december and million at december reflecting increases in brokerage assets and for much of and yearoveryear increases in the value of the stock market at december pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion in brokerage assets compared to billion and billion at december and respectively insurance commissions were approximately million during and compared to million during additionally at december our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion and billion of managed and custodied assets respectively compared to approximately billion and billion at december and billion and billion at december the growth in our wealth management businesses is attributable to our expanded distribution platform with the addition of associates across our footprint gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million million and million respectively for the years ended december and the yearoveryear growth in and decline in in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was attributable to the impact of the interest rate environment on mortgage production during each respective period we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program the hedge is not designated as a hedge for gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement there is positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge therefore the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at december the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at december expected to close in respectively for the year ended december investment gains losses on sales and impairments net represent a million pretax loss we recognized upon the sale of million of investment securities compared to a million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in and an million net pretax loss on the sale of million of investment securities in as we sought to restructure a portion of our securities portfolio in each period in preparation for changes in the yield curve during those periods the loss recorded in also allowed us to capture an increased tax deduction in that period due to the reduction in corporate tax rates beginning in as a result of the passage of the tax act income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg bhg is engaged in the origination of commerical and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold with limited or nonrecourse to independent financial institutions and investors bhg has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys accountants and others through subsidiaries that it owns it also has expanded into patient financing which involves loans to individuals to finance medical expenses particularly those to patients with high deductible health plans income from this equitymethod investment was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively the increased level of contribution we have experienced from bhg in when compared to and reflects the positive results bhg has experienced as a result of enhancements to its business model including its marketing efforts historically bhg has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option in the second half of bhg began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years this change in its business model is likely to reduce bhgs revenue in compared to what it would have recognized had it continued to sell a larger percentage of its loans to its bank network of purchasers however we do anticipate an increase in revenues for bhg in when compared to we believe however over time this practice should produce a less volatile revenue stream than its gain on sale model going forward so long as credit losses remain in line with historical experience this model of retaining more of the loans that it originates on its balance sheet will require bhg to access funding sources in amounts greater than were previously required under the gain on sale model bhg has arranged warehouse line financing from multiple financial institutions to facilitate this shift in strategy but may require additional funding to expand its ability to retain more loans on its balance sheet the table of contents costs for this funding will likely reduce bhgs earnings in the near term in comparison to what it may have earned under its gain on sale model with similar origination volumes income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively at december there were million of these intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair value of certain of bhgs liabilities of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively at december there were million of these liabilities that are expected to be accreted into income in lesser amounts over the next seven years during the years ended december and respectively pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank received million million and million in dividends in the aggregate from bhg which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg our proportionate share of earnings from bhg are included in our consolidated tax return profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated earnings from bhg may fluctuate from periodtoperiod as our ownership interest in bhg is and our representatives do not occupy a majority of the seats on bhgs board of managers we do not consolidate bhgs results of operations or financial position into our financial statements but record the net result of bhgs activities at our percentage ownership in income from equitymethod investment in noninterest income for the year ended december bhg reported million in gross revenues net of substitution losses of million compared to million and million respectively for the years ended december and net of substitution losses of million and million respectively the following discussion considers bhgs results of operations for and prior to consideration of our ownership interest approximately million or of these revenues for the year ended december related to gains on the sale of commercial loans bhg had previously issued primarily to doctor dentist and other medical practices compared to million or for the year ended december and million or for the year ended december bhg refers to this activity as its core product and at december and bhg had loans held for sale totaling million and million respectively bhg typically funds these loans from cash reserves on its balance sheet subsequently these core product loans are sold with no recourse to bhg to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model at december and there were billion and billion respectively in core product loans previously sold by bhg that were actively serviced by bhgs network of bank purchasers bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these core product loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments this substitution is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the standards of its purchase agreement with bhg additionally all substitutions are subject to the approval by bhgs board of managers as a result the reacquired loans are deemed purchase credit impaired and recorded on bhgs balance sheet at the net present value of the loans anticipated cash flows bhg will then initiate collection efforts and attempt to restore the reacquired loan to performing status as a result bhg maintained a liability as of december and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution this liability represents of core product loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of both december and bhg will maintain loans on its balance sheet for a period of time prior to sale or transfer to a purchaser alternatively bhg may elect to keep certain loans on its balance sheet through maturity from time to time bhg may hold a higher volume of these loans depending upon the timing of loan originations their loan pipeline and market demand as well as the deployment of their business strategy as previously discussed bhg recently realigned their business model to retain more of their originated loans on their balance sheet at december bhg reported balance sheet loans totaling million compared to million as of december a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at december and bhg had million and million of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting interest income and fees and amounted to million million and million for the years ended december and respectively table of contents bhg also sometimes refers loans to other financial institutions and based on an agreement with the institution earn a fee for doing so typically these are loans that bhg believes would either be classified as consumertype loans rather than commercial loans fail to meet the credit underwriting standards of bhg but another institution will accept the loans or are to borrowers in certain geographic locations where bhg has elected not to do business for the years ended december and bhg recognized fee income of million million and million respectively from these activities included in other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased in as a result of increased debit and credit card transactions as compared to the comparable periods in and resulting from the increase in customers during the respective periods other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance which was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively the increase in earnings on these bankowned life insurance policies resulted primarily from the purchase of million of new policies during and million of new policies purchased in the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable loan swap fees and sba loan sales are all included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment additionally the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers noninterest expense the

total salaries and employee benefits expense in over and is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in over and and annual merit increases to base salaries at december our associate base had expanded to fulltime equivalent associates as compared to and at december and respectively primarily resulting from our efforts to continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates throughout our footprint we expect salary and employee benefit expenses will continue to rise as we continue to hire experienced bankers and other associates across our franchise including in the atlanta georgia market in which we entered late in the fourth quarter of we also expect salaries and benefits expense will increase in when compared to due to our increased associate base and annual merit increases given in the first quarter of each fiscal year and as we continue to enhance the infrastructure around our operations to account for our increased size and geographic reach commissions expense represents compensation paid to our wealth management lines of business including investment services trust insurance and capital markets commissions expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in the increase in as compared to and as compared to is primarily related to growth in our investment portfolio commissions commissions expense incurred related to the production of residential mortgages is recorded net of the related mortgage revenues we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an employee base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions historically all of our noncommissioned associates have participated in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and all of our associates participate in our equity compensation plans advocate capitals associates did not participate in our companywide plan in and will participate in an advocate capital plan in under the annual cash incentive plan the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of revenues and diluted earnings per share subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and revenues and earnings are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of our targeted incentives in our cash incentives represented of targeted incentive compensation compared to in and in cash incentives for totaled million compared to million in and million in the increase in when compared to was primarily the result of the increase in the percentage of target of the payout from in to in as well as certain new associates that we had hired being able to

related to equitybased restricted share units with performancebased vesting criteria we have not issued stock options since under our equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for all associates we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization our compensation expense associated with equity awards for increased when compared to and as a result of the additional associates we hired in those periods including associates obtained in connection with the acquisitions of advocate capital and bnc as well as increases in the amount of performance units awarded to our senior associates we expect our compensation expense associated with equity awards to increase in when compared to as a result of our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors in as well as increases in the amount of performance units awarded to our senior associates employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our plan health insurance payroll taxes and contract labor these expenses increased by million in compared to which increased by million when compared to the increase in as compared to and as compared to was primarily the result of the increase in fulltime equivalent associates in each respective period equipment and occupancy expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in included in the year ended december increase was a million noncash impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint additionally we experienced increased expenses associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm during the comparable periods and expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance our cybersecurity and operational infrastructure the increase in as compared to is primarily due to our bnc merger including the completion and opening of an office in north carolina in and two new locations opened in our tennessee markets in the latter part of we believe the number of our locations will increase over an extended period of time across our franchise and we have identified a location for our initial office in the atlanta georgia metro area in future periods these expansions may lead to higher equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense table of contents other real estate expense for the year ended december was million compared to in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of a million writedown in the second quarter of of facilities and land acquired in the bnc acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion the decrease in compared to is related to the million decrease in other real estate owned during the year ended december marketing and business development expense for the year ended december was greater than in which was greater than in the primary source of the increases in as compared to is the associated marketing and business development expenses necessary to support the growth of our firm across our entire franchise in tennessee the carolinas and virginia the primary source of the increase in as compared to is related to our merger with bnc and the associated marketing and business development expenses to support that expansion we expect our marketing and business development expenses will increase in including as a result of our expansion into the atlanta georgia metro market noninterest expense related to the amortization of intangibles was million for the year ended december compared to million and million for the years ended december and respectively the increase in amortization expense in was attributable to an increase in amortizing intangibles resulting from our acquisitions in and respectively the following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets their initial valuations and their intangible lives

amortization period no mergerrelated expenses were recorded during the year ended december during the years ended december and mergerrelated expenses of million and million respectively were incurred associated with our acquisitions which occurred in or prior to those respective periods mergerrelated expenses in included costs to finalize the cultural and technical integrations related to our acquisition of bnc and associate retention packages mergerrelated expenses in primarily included the cost of the technical and cultural integration lease termination fees costs associated with the bnc branch rationalization plan we executed in the cost of certain assumed equity awards that vested upon the change in control and retention bonuses paid to former bnc associates for their services

when compared to each as a result of increased volumes in those respective periods audit exam and insurance expense is comprised of the fees associated with ongoing audit and regulatory exams of our operations as well as the cost of our corporate insurance increases in audit exam and insurance expense in as compared to and is primarily related to increased regulation of our operations as a result of our increased asset size in each of the respective periods administrative and other expenses increased by million to million during when compared to table of contents and by million to million during when compared to a portion of that change resulted from franchise tax expense which increased million in when compared to and by million in when compared to the increased franchise tax expense is primarily the result our expanded tax base our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was and for the three years ended december and respectively the efficiency ratio for the year ended december compared to was negatively impacted by million of losses on the sale of our nonprime automobile portfolio a million writedown of facilities and land acquired in the bnc acquisition that previously had been held for potential expansion and a million noncash impairment charge related to the consolidation of five offices across our footprint during the year ended december net gains and losses on sales of securities impacted our efficiency ratios in all periods and increased revenue from increased interest earning assets in the period over the and periods and the absence of mergerrelated expenses in positively impacted our efficiency ratio in the period when compared to and periods the efficiency ratio improved in as compared to primarily due to the completion in of the integration and technology conversion associated with the acquisition of bnc and the growth in interest earning assets income taxes during the year ended december we recorded income tax expense of million compared to million and million in and respectively as a result of the tax act in we recorded a noncash charge of million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets due to the statutory federal income tax rate for corporate entities decreasing from percent to percent for and future periods our effective income tax rate was and respectively for the years ended december and the reduction in was primarily due to the reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate following enactment of the tax act our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of and during the respective periods primarily due to our investments in bankqualified municipal securities tax benefits from our real estate investment trust and municipal investment subsidiaries participation in tennessees community investment tax credit citc program tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation bankowned life insurance and tax savings from our captive insurance subsidiary offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense certain mergerrelated expenses and in and nondeductible fdic insurance premiums and nondeductible executive compensation impacting tax expense during the years ended december and was also our adoption on january of fasb accounting standards update asu stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment activity which represented a change in accounting for the tax effects related to vesting of common shares and the exercise of stock options previously granted to our employees through our various equity compensation plans this change resulted in a reduction in tax expense of million million and million respectively for the years ended december and as the income tax effects related to settlements of sharebased payment awards is now required to be reported as increases or decreases to income tax

reflects an increase of billion in outstanding loans to billion and an increase of billion in total deposits to billion from december total assets were billion at december as compared to billion at december we acquired loans of billion and deposits totaling billion upon our acquisition of bnc in we acquired loans of million and deposits totaling million upon our acquisition of avenue in collectively we acquired billion in loans and billion in deposits upon our acquisitions of capitalmark and magna in loans the composition of loans at december for each of the past five years and the percentage of each segment to total loans are summarized as follows dollars in thousands table start amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial real estate mortgage consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans table end table of contents the composition of our loan portfolio changed due to our acquisition of bnc in which focused more on commercial real estate lending including construction than we did in our tennessee markets as we intend to focus on growth of the commercial and industrial segment across our franchise footprint we continue to believe our commercial and industrial portfolio will again become a more substantial portion of our total loan portfolio this focus was evident in and as the commercial and industrial segment represented more of our total loan portfolio at december than it did at december we will continue to focus on the growth of this segment in and future periods the commercial real estate mortgage category includes owneroccupied commercial real estate loans at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate mortgage loans was secured by owneroccupied commercial real estate properties owneroccupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate additionally the construction and land development segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development in the local economies in which we operate and is diversified between commercial residential and land the following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at december according to contractual maturities of one year or less after one year through five years and after five years the

does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments loan origination risk management we maintain lending policies and procedures designed to maximize lending opportunities within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loans in our portfolio loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming loans diversification in the loan portfolio is measured and monitored as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the expected ability of a borrower to repay its obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and generally are collateralized by business assets and may have a personal guaranty of business principals collateral pledged may include the assets being financed or other assets such as accounts receivable inventory or equipment some loans may be advanced on an unsecured basis table of contents commercial real estatemortgage loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and are underwritten based on the ability of the property in the case of income producing property or the borrowers business if owneroccupied to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt secondary emphasis is placed upon collateral value and the financial strength of guarantors if any commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy as detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio generally are diverse in terms of type and industry and we measure and monitor concentrations regularly we believe this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry or type of real estate product management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow collateral geography and risk grade criteria we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates financial analysis of the developers and property owners and expectations of the permanent mortgage market among other items construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and appraised value associated with the completed project which may be inaccurate construction loans involve the disbursement of funds during construction with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be sales of developed property refinancing in the permanent mortgage market or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans because their ultimate repayment depends on the satisfactory completion of construction and is sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we also originate consumer loans including consumer realestate loans where we typically use a computerbased credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers seeks to minimize risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements we also maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit and risk committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures lending concentrations we periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries we use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications we have a credit exposure loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments exceeding of pinnacle banks total riskbased capital to borrowers in the following industries at december and in thousands table start at december outstanding principal balances unfunded commitments total exposure total exposure at december lessors of nonresidential buildings lessors of residential buildings new housing forsale builders hotels and motels table end banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at december and pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital was and respectively nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans including construction and loan development loans was and for december and respectively pinnacle bank was within the and guidelines throughout and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the and thresholds though there may be periods where we exceed these levels if loan growth is more heavily weighted to these types of loans table of contents performing loans in past due

or of total loans outstanding at december potential problem loans which are not included in nonperforming loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard or worse but not considered nonperforming loans approximately million of potential problem loans were past due at least but less than days as of december nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at december we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at december and million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at december at december and there were million and million respectively of troubled debt restructurings that were performing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status but are considered impaired loans pursuant to us gaap all nonaccruing loans are reassigned to a special assets officer who was not responsible for originating the loan the special assets officer is responsible for developing an action plan designed to minimize our future losses typically these special assets officers review our loan files interview prior officers assigned to the relationship meet with borrowers inspect collateral reappraise collateral andor consult with legal counsel the special assets officer then recommends an action plan to a committee of senior associates including lenders and workout specialists which could include foreclosing on collateral restructuring the loan issuing demand letters or other actions we discontinue the accrual of interest income when there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or the principal or interest is more than days past due unless the loan is both wellsecured and in the process of collection during and respectively we recognized and of interest income from nonperforming loans reflecting cash payments received from the borrower and our belief at the time of payment that the underlying collateral supported the carrying amount of the loans table of contents due to the weakening credit status of a borrower we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses if any that we might incur these loans are considered troubled debt restructurings and are considered to be impaired loans pursuant to us gaap if on nonaccruing status as of the date of restructuring any restructured loan is included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and is classified as an impaired loan loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans however such loans are still considered impaired at december we owned million in other real estate which we had acquired usually through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure from borrowers compared to million at december the majority of this real estate is located within our principal markets at december oreo included million of properties we acquired in connection with our acquisition of bnc that had previously been held for future expansion that were transferred to oreo in allowance for loan losses allowance we maintain the allowance at a level that our management deems appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december and our allowance for loan losses was million and million respectively which our management deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has remained relatively flat from at december to at december the slight change in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is primarily attributable to provision expense associated with organic loan growth during when compared to the absolute level of our allowance for loan losses is largely driven by continued favorable credit experience in our larger portfolios and we believe it is supported by the strong economies present in the markets in which we currently operate also impacting the overall balance of our allowance for loan losses is fair value accounting on our acquired loan portfolios as no allowance for loan losses is assigned to acquired loans as of the date of acquisition however an allowance for loan losses is recorded for purchased loans that have experienced credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition or increases in balances outstanding our accounting policy is to compare the computed allowance for loan losses on a loanbyloan basis for purchased loans to the remaining fair value adjustment if the computed allowance at the loan level is greater than the remaining fair value adjustment the excess is added to the allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses the judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under critical accounting estimates above as of december net loans included a net fair value discount of million for the years ended december and respectively the net fair value discount changed as follows table start accretable yield nonaccretable yield total december yeartodate accretion and settlements december reclassification from nonaccretable to accretable

loans the allocated loan loss attributable to impaired loans is included in the respective category above the unallocated category is intended to allow for losses that are inherent in our portfolio that we have not yet identified or attributed to a specific risk factor and for modeling imprecision additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in note loans and allowance for loan losses to the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following is a summary of changes in the

at end of period ratio of net chargeoffs to average loans outstanding for the period table end the decrease in the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans over the last several years is primarily as a result of recording our acquired portfolios at fair value upon acquisition net chargeoffs in the commercial and industrial portfolio are largely due to loans that were reported as nonperforming assets as of december and for which further deterioration resulted in chargeoffs during the year ended december table of contents as noted in our critical accounting policies management assesses the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of the loan portfolios past loan loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio the views of pinnacle banks regulators adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio economic conditions industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of inherent losses existing in the loan portfolio at december while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and thus the resulting provision for loan losses investments our investment portfolio consisting primarily of federal agency bonds state and municipal securities and mortgagebacked securities amounted to billion and billion billion at december and respectively our investment to asset ratio has increased from at december to at december our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income collateral for public funds and as a potential liquidity source during pinnacle sold million of investment securities for a net pretax loss of million compared to million of investment securities for a net pretax loss of million during and million of investment securities for a net pretax loss of million during these sales were implemented as part of our efforts to reposition our investment portfolio to provide our balance sheet more protection from the rate environment in each respective period the timing of the sales in also allowed us to capture an increased tax deduction in due to the reduction in corporate tax rates beginning in as a result of the passage of the tax act during the third quarter of pinnacle financial

increased levels of brokered time deposits advances from fhlb cincinnati and subordinated debt table of contents when wholesale funding is necessary to complement the companys core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives we increased our exposure to brokered deposits and brokered

specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of december our funding policies impose

capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject in december the basel committee on banking supervision published the last version of the basel iii accord generally referred to as basel iv the basel committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of riskweighted assets rwa which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk which will facilitate the comparability of banks capital ratios constraining the use of internally modeled approaches and complementing the riskweighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor leadership of the federal banking agencies who are tasked with implementing basel iv has indicated that it is considering how to appropriately apply these revisions in the united states although it is uncertain at this time we anticipate some if not all of the basel iv accord may be incorporated into the capital requirements framework applicable to us and pinnacle bank share repurchase program on november pinnacle financial announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of pinnacle financials outstanding common stock and increased its authorization by million on october the original repurchase program expires on march and the new program expires on december pinnacle financial repurchased  of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million in the fiscal year ended december share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the management of pinnacle financial after the board of directors of pinnacle financial authorizes a repurchase program the approved share repurchase programs do not obligate pinnacle financial to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and the program may be extended modified suspended or discontinued at any time stock repurchases generally are affected through open market purchases and may be made through unsolicited negotiated transactions the timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements table of contents dividends pursuant to tennessee banking law pinnacle bank may not without the prior consent of the tdfi pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of its retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years during the year ended december pinnacle bank paid dividends of million to us which was within the limits allowed by the tdfi during the year ended december we paid million in dividends to common shareholders on january our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of approximately million in aggregate that will be paid on february to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on february the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including new regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in our analysis presented below to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging actions we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from a flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated table start estimated change in net interest income over months instantaneous rate change december december bps increase bps increase bps decrease table end table of contents during shortterm interest rate movements reversed direction as there were three cuts in the federal funds rate these cuts followed an approximate three year period where the federal funds rate had increased by management responded in by repositioning the balance sheets sensitivity to market risk position so that it was better positioned for cuts in the shortterm interest rate environment that change in position is apparent when comparing the scenario results yearoveryear in the table above management accomplished this change through the following actions among others purchased billion of inthemoney interest rate floors for loans tied to the onemonth libor interest rate index unwound million of fair value hedges receive variable ratepay fixed rate tied to our loan portfolio extended the effective duration of our securities portfolio as well as boosting the portfolios level of protection against prepayment activity and shortened the duration of our wholesale funding portfolio the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in the alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accuracte predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at december our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy the board has suspended the requirement to model the down and bps scenarios while year maturity treasury rates are below which was the case as of december economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at december and our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates table start instantaneous rate change december december bps increase bps increase bps decrease table end while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at december our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy the board has suspended the requirement to model the down and bps scenarios while year maturity treasury rates are below which was the case as of december most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward table of contents each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how if at all these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into the asset liability modeling software we and other firms utilize it is difficult to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario considers two decreases in shortterm interest rates in the second half of our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at december we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue this policy if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position table of contents scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis as noted previously pinnacle bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati and pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the fhlb cincinnati has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on the firms alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the fhlb cincinnati at december we believe we had an estimated billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within less than a month there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at december or during the year then ended although we test the availability of these accommodations annually pinnacle bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at december at each of december and we had approximately billion in brokered deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid typically these funds have been for varying maturities of up to two years and were issued at rates which were competitive to rates that we would be required to pay to attract similar deposits within many of our local markets as well as rates for fhlb cincinnati advances of similar maturities banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at december we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint in future periods these expansions may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm table of contents our shortterm borrowings borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with
