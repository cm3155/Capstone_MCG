item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition at june and december and our results of operations for the three and six months ended june and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in part ii item risk factors herein as well as our annual report on for additional information regarding our capital and shareholders equity see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q dividends pursuant to tennessee banking law our bank may not without the prior consent of the tdfi pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our banks retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years which was million at june during the six months ended june our bank paid dividends of million to us which is within the limits allowed by the tdfi during the three and six months ended june we paid million and million respectively in dividends to our common shareholders on july our board of directors declared a per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on aug to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on aug additionally on that same day our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately million or per share or per depositary share on the series b preferred stock payable on sept to shareholders of record at the close of business on aug the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including if necessary our receipt of dividends from pinnacle bank regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiarys financial results market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled during the first half of several unique events occurred that are noteworthy when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of june to the modeling results at december in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points we built over billion in additional onbalancesheet liquidity we unwound a billion inthemoney interest rate floor earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated estimated change in net interest income over months june instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at june our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at june our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates june instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at june our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how if at all these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into firms asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario considers no change in shortterm interest rates throughout the remainder of our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at june we were in compliance with our internal policies related to liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits particularly noncore deposit could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis in addition our bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati as a result our bank receives advances from the fhlb cincinnati pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements which support our funding needs under the borrowing agreements with the fhlb cincinnati our bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and pursuant to a blanket lien all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on its alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets reduce the amount of pledged assets or experience changes in the value of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati at june we estimate we had billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati during the three and six months ended june million in fhlb advances were restructured and prepayment penalties of million were recognized in expense for the three months ended june at june our bank had received advances from the fhlb cincinnati totaling billion at june the scheduled maturities of pinnacle banks fhlb cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows in thousands scheduled maturities amount interest rates thereafter total weighted average interest rate some fhlb cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future the table reflects rates in effect as of june pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks available for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within a month of borrowing we had no outstanding borrowings at june under these agreements our bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at june at june excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the promontory network we had billion of brokered deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates of deposit through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid during the first half of and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we intentionally increased our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity during the first quarter of this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits increased borrowings from the fhlb cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits core deposit growth during the second quarter of increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of onbalance sheet liquidity banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at june we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm offbalance sheet arrangements at june we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of billion because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements if needed to fund these outstanding commitments pinnacle bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or on a shortterm basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation unlike most industrial companies virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institutions performance than the effects of general levels of inflation recently adopted
