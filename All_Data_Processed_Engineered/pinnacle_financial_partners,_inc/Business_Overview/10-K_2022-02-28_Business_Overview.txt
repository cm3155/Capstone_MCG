the doddfrank act which includes significant consumer protection provisions related to among other things residential mortgage loans that have increased and are likely to further increase our regulatory compliance costs the doddfrank act also imposes other restrictions on our operations including restrictions on the types of investments that bank holding companies and banks can make failure to comply with the requirements of the doddfrank act would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our growth or expansion activities while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us such changes could be materially adverse to our investors interchange fees the doddfrank act included provisions known as the durbin amendment which restrict interchange fees to those which are reasonable and proportionate for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing the federal reserve issued final rules implementing the durbin amendment on june in the final rules interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at plus five basis points plus for fraud loss in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate the interchange fee restrictions contained in the durbin amendment and the rules promulgated thereunder only apply to debit card issuers with billion or more in total consolidated assets like pinnacle bank the implications of the durbin amendment first became applicable to us on july the volcker rul e section of the bank holding company act and its implementing regulations commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and prohibits certain interests in or relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule applies to pinnacle financial pinnacle bank and their affiliates in october the federal banking agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the volcker rules compliance requirements to the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities clarify certain key provision in the volcker rule and modify the information that companies are required to provide these agencies in june these agencies finalized additional modifications to their regulations expanding the ability of banking entities to make investments in certain

principal federal consumer protection laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the service members civil relief act the real estate settlement procedures act and the truth in saving act among others on july we are subject to oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including among other things the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers a lack of financial savvy b inability to protect himself in the selection or use

consumer financial law hold hearings and commence civil litigation the cfpb can issue ceaseanddesist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws the cfpb may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws and obtaining the forms of relief described above and we expect the cfpbs oversight and enforcement to increase over the next few years the rules issued by the cfpb will have a longterm impact on our business including our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities compliance with these rules has increased and will continue to increase our overall regulatory compliance costs on july the cfpb took over conducting onsite consumer examinations from the fdic for all regulations that transferred under their supervision economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act on may president trump signed into law the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the growth act the growth act alters some of the provisions of the doddfrank act certain of these provisions to which we became subject once our total assets exceeded billion are set out below along with the changes made to such provisions under the growth act under the doddfrank act publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total assets like pinnacle financial were required to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprisewide risk management practices pinnacle financial established a risk committee on february the growth act raised the minimum asset threshold triggering the requirement to establish a risk committee from billion to billion as a result pinnacle financial is no longer required to maintain its standalone risk committee though it has done so and expects it will continue to do so pursuant to the doddfrank act any banking organization including whether a bank holding company or a depository institution with more than billion in total consolidated assets and regulated by a federal financial regulatory agency was required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests to ensure it had sufficient capital during periods of economic downturn pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks first stress tests were due in july the growth act raised the asset threshold at which companies are required to conduct the stress tests from billion to billion while we are no longer required to annually conduct stress tests under the doddfrank act we have continued to perform and expect to continue to perform stress tests from time to time in connection with our capital planning process and to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators while the economic growth act provides some regulatory relief for midsized bank holding companies like us most provisions of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a

regulations including raising certain assets thresholds above those currently in place we may continue to face enhanced scrutiny from our regulators who may expect us to continue to comply with the
