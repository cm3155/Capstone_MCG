increased reliance on associates working and serving clients remotely to the federal reserve lowering shortterm interest rates late in the first quarter of to near historic lows and the united states government approving unprecedented levels of economic stimulus and relief programs including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and its paycheck protection program ppp we were forced to take a number of unprecedented actions in in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact to our customers we implemented a shortterm modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by covid19 who were not more than days past due at the time of the modification this program allowed for a deferral of payments for days which we could extend for an additional days for a maximum of days on a cumulative and successive basis pursuant to interagency guidance these shortterm deferrals were not deemed to meet the criteria for reporting as troubled debt restructurings tdrs in addition to the shortterm modification program we implemented section of the cares act and bank regulatory interagency guidance gave entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for tdrs indicating that a lender could modify the terms of a loan that was less than days past due as of december where the borrower had been impacted by covid19 and conclude that those modifications were not troubled debt restructurings we believe we have followed the guidance under the cares act and the interagency guidance related to these loan modifications in we also expended significant resources and energy to extend loans to new and existing customers pursuant to the ppp a cares act program designed to aid small and mediumsized businesses sole proprietors and other selfemployed persons through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks these loans were

structures regulations and competitive relationships of the nations financial institutions in the us congress passed the doddfrank act which includes significant consumer protection provisions related to among other things residential mortgage loans that have increased and are likely to further increase our regulatory compliance costs the doddfrank act also imposes other restrictions on our operations including restrictions on the types of investments that bank holding companies and banks can make failure to comply with the requirements of the doddfrank act would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our growth or expansion activities while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us such changes could be materially adverse to our investors interchange fees the doddfrank act included provisions known as the durbin amendment which restrict interchange fees to those which are reasonable and proportionate for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing the federal reserve issued final rules implementing the durbin amendment on june in the final rules interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at plus five basis points plus for fraud loss in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate the interchange fee restrictions contained in the durbin amendment and the rules promulgated thereunder only apply to debit card issuers with billion or more in total consolidated assets like pinnacle bank the implications of the durbin amendment first became applicable to us on july the volcker rul e section of the bank holding company act and its implementing regulations commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and prohibits certain interests in or relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule applies to pinnacle financial pinnacle bank and their affiliates in october the federal banking agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the volcker rules compliance requirements to the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities clarify certain key provision in the volcker rule and modify the information that companies are required to provide these agencies in june these agencies finalized additional modifications to their regulations expanding the ability of banking entities to make investments in certain types of private equity funds these amendments became effective on october consumer financial protection bureau the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the service members civil relief act the real estate settlement procedures act and the truth in saving act among others on july we are subject to oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including among other things the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers a lack of financial savvy b inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or c reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumers interests the cfpb has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law hold hearings and commence civil litigation the cfpb can issue ceaseanddesist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws the cfpb may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws and obtaining the forms of relief described above and we expect the cfpbs oversight and enforcement to increase over the next few years the rules issued by the cfpb will have a longterm impact on our business including our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities compliance with these rules will increase our overall regulatory compliance costs on july the cfpb took over conducting onsite consumer examinations from the fdic for all regulations that transferred under their supervision economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act on may president trump signed into law the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the growth act the growth act alters some of the provisions of the doddfrank act certain of these provisions to which we became subject once our total assets exceeded billion are set out below along with the changes made to such provisions under the growth act under the doddfrank act publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total assets like pinnacle financial were required to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprisewide risk management practices pinnacle financial established a risk committee on february the growth act raised the minimum asset threshold triggering the requirement to establish a risk committee from billion to billion as a result pinnacle financial is no longer required to maintain its standalone risk committee though it expects it will continue to do so pursuant to the doddfrank act any banking organization including whether a bank holding company or a depository institution with more than billion in total consolidated assets and regulated by a federal financial regulatory agency was required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests to ensure it had sufficient capital during periods of economic downturn pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks first stress tests were due in july the growth act raised the asset threshold at which companies are required to conduct the stress tests from billion to billion while we are no longer required to annually conduct stress tests under the doddfrank act we expect to continue to perform stress tests from time to time in connection with our capital planning process and to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators while the economic growth act provides some regulatory relief for midsized bank holding companies like us most provisions of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and

deposits through its control over the issuance of united states government securities its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject we cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies proposed legislation and regulatory action new regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wideranging provisions for altering the structures regulations and competitive relationships of the nations financial institutions we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute or change in applicable rules or regulations even if modifications are enacted to existing or proposed regulations including raising certain assets thresholds above those currently in place we may continue to face enhanced scrutiny from our regulators
