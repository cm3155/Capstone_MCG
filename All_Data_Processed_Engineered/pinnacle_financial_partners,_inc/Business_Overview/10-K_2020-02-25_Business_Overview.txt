including without limitation savings and loans associations credit unions finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies and other financial intermediaries the financial services industry is becoming even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation banks securities firms and insurance companies can operate as affiliates under the umbrella of a financial holding company which can offer virtually any type of financial service including banking securities underwriting insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems many of our nonbank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can continued consolidation in the financial services industry due in part to the regulatory changes made under the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act including the increased asset threshold for required stress testing as discussed below under supervision and regulation the doddfrank act has contributed to increases in the number of large competitors we face in our markets finally our competitors may choose to offer lower interest rates and pay higher deposit rates than we do we believe that the most important criteria to our banks targeted clients when selecting a bank is their desire to receive exceptional and personal customer service while being able to enjoy convenient access to a broad array of financial products additionally when presented with a choice we believe that many of our banks targeted clients would
