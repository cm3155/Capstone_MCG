companys risk management framework the plan sets forth funding strategies and procedures that management can quickly leverage to assist in decisionmaking and specifies roles and responsibilities for departments impacted by a potential liquidity stress event market risk and interest rate sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at december the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly related to cash flow hedges information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest incomelending investing and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements the companys mlcr committee monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes table displays as of december and the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year table sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates table start changes in interest rates calculated change in projected net interest income dollars in millions december december basis points basis points basis points basis points table end the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes mix and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario changes in the amounts and the reduction in net interest income sensitivity presented since december reflect changes in portfolio composition including shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and higher levels of borrowings the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and the deployment of cash into fixed rate investment securities the company has also entered into additional interest rate swap agreements whereby it receives settlement amounts at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate amidst the rising rate environment since the first quarter of mts cumulative deposit pricing beta which is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates approximated percent excluding brokered deposits that cumulative pricing beta approximated percent the cumulative deposit pricing beta including and excluding brokered deposits is assumed to approximate to percent in the interest rate scenarios presented the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes management also uses an economic value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above and provide a longterm interest rate risk metric economic value of equity is a pointintime analysis of the economic sensitivity of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives management measures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios including immediate shifts of the yield curve table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities equally nor as assumed in the table on the contractual maturity or repricing date furthermore this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities projected

financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally

described in note of notes to financial statements in applying those accounting policies management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies assumptions and estimates to be utilized certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following accounting for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets including loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management in estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio borrowerspecific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period for certain loan pools that share similar risk characteristics the company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment gdp and real estate prices these forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models subsequent to the forecast period the company utilizes longerterm historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods a discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets such as investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments however for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension benefit obligations and certain derivative and other financial instruments these valuations require the use of various assumptions including among others discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation the company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income examples include certain investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets among others specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes and of notes to financial statements commitments contingencies and offbalance sheet arrangements information regarding the companys commitments and contingencies
