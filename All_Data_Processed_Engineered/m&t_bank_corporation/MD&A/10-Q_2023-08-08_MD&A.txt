series h preferred stock of mt the peoples united transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly assets acquired liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date the company recorded assets acquired of billion including billion of loans and leases and billion of investment securities and liabilities assumed totaling billion including billion of deposits the transaction added billion to mts common shareholders equity and million to preferred equity in connection with the acquisition the company recorded billion of goodwill and million of core deposit and other intangible assets the acquisition of peoples united formed a banking franchise with approximately billion in assets serving communities in the northeast and midatlantic from maine to virginia including washington dc in april mt completed the divestiture of its collective investment trust cit business to a private

aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income aggregated million in the second quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share in the recent quarter and the corresponding quarter were and respectively net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were million and respectively in the first quarter of for the first six months of net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were billion and respectively compared with million and respectively in the first half of expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets net operating income in the recent quarter was compared with in the second quarter of and in 2023s first quarter net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of in the second quarter of in the yearearlier quarter and in the first quarter of for the first half of net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and respectively compared with and respectively in the corresponding period reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income net interest income expressed on a taxableequivalent basis was billion in the second quarter of increased from billion recorded in the yearearlier quarter that increase reflects a basis point hundredths of one percent expansion of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier quarter the increased net interest margin was influenced by a rising interest rate environment resulting from actions taken by the federal reserve to mitigate inflationary pressures on the us economy the federal reserve raised its target federal funds rate through multiple hikes totaling from march through june which led to higher yields on loans deposits at the federal reserve bank frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates paid on interestbearing deposits and borrowings taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined slightly from billion in the first quarter of that decrease reflects a basis point narrowing of the net interest margin and a billion increase in interestbearing liabilities to billion compared with billion in the initial quarter partially offset by a billion increase in average earning assets to billion in the recent quarter from billion in 2023s first quarter the net interest margin was in the first quarter of for the first six months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion up from billion recognized in the corresponding period the increase was primarily attributable to the higher level of average earning assets and a basis point expansion of the net interest margin to in the period from in the yearearlier period partially offset by an increase in average interestbearing liabilities the increase in average earning assets in the first half of includes the impact of one additional quarter from earning assets obtained in the peoples united transaction on april commercial loan growth and purchases of investment securities partially offset by lower deposits at the frb of new york the increase in average interestbearing liabilities reflects interestbearing liabilities assumed in the peoples united acquisition and a continued shift in customer deposits toward higher cost interestbearing products including time deposits and higher average borrowings average loans and leases totaled billion in the second quarter of up billion or from billion in the similar quarter of commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the recent quarter up billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter that increase predominantly reflects growth in loans to financial and insurance industry customers and loans to motorvehicle and recreational finance dealers partially offset by a reduction in average balances of paycheck protection program ppp loans reflecting loan repayments by the small business administration ppp loans averaged million in the second quarter of compared with million in the second quarter of average commercial real estate loans decreased billion or to billion in the second quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter that decrease reflects declines of billion in average construction loans and million in average permanent commercial real

originated residential mortgage loans mt returned to originating for sale the majority of its newly committed residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of consumer loans averaged billion in the second quarter of up million or from billion in the yearearlier quarter that growth reflected a higher average balance of million in mts portfolio of recreational finance loans partially offset by a decline of million in average balances of automobile loans average loan and lease balances in the second quarter of increased billion from billion in the first quarter of the higher balances resulted predominantly from growth in commercial loans and leases which increased billion from billion in the first quarter of and reflected higher balances of loans to financial and insurance industry customers and motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers average commercial real estate loans in the second quarter of declined million from billion in the first quarter of average balances of residential real estate loans in the recently completed quarter were essentially unchanged from 2023s first quarter average consumer loans in the recent quarter decreased million from billion in the

from 2nd qtr 2nd qtr 1st qtr in millions commercial financial etc real estate commercial real estate consumer consumer recreational finance automobile home equity lines and loans other total consumer total for the first six months of average loans and leases totaled billion up from billion in the corresponding period loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition and commercial loan growth were the predominant factors for that increase partially offset by declining average balances of commercial real estate loans and average balances of ppp loans ppp loans averaged million and million in the first six months of and respectively the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the second quarter of up billion from billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion higher than the billion averaged in the first quarter of the higher average balance in the second quarter of when compared with the yearearlier quarter reflects the purchase of billion of investment securities during the twelvemonth period ended june those purchases were predominantly us treasury notes and fixed rate mortgagebacked securities when compared with the first quarter of the increase relates to a full quarters impact of the purchases of approximately billion of investment securities during that first quarter those purchases consisted predominantly of fixed rate mortgagebacked securities for the first six months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively in addition to the purchases described herein billion of investment securities obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april contributed to the increase in average investment securities during the first half of as compared with the first half of there were no significant sales of investment securities during the six months ended june and the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the frb of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury and federal agency notes but also includes municipal securities and commercial real estate mortgagebacked securities when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of movements in interest rates and spreads changes in liquidity needs actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized gains and losses on such equity securities were not significant in each of the first six months of and the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the six months ended june or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of june the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended june june and march respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at those respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the frb of new york in general the amount of deposits held at the frb of new york fluctuates due to changes in levels of the companys investments loans deposits and other borrowings the lower balances in the recent quarter and the first quarter of compared with the yearearlier quarter reflect loan portfolio growth the purchases of investment securities and treasury stock and the decline in noninterest bearing deposits partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt and other shortterm borrowings and an increase in time deposits as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the second quarter of and billion in the first quarter of average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first six months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the similar quarter and billion in the first quarter of the decrease in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter and 2023s initial quarter was primarily the result of monetary tightening that influenced customers to seek higher rate alternatives including a shift from operating demand accounts to offbalance sheet sweep accounts for commercial customers lower levels of activity in the capital markets also resulted in a reduction of trust demand deposits the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from 2nd qtr 2nd qtr 1st qtr in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over and brokered deposits time deposits over averaged billion in the recent quarter compared with million in the second quarter of and billion in the first quarter of the increase in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the second quarter of reflects higher demand for time deposit products in a rising interest rate environment the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts that averaged billion during the recent quarter billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of brokered time deposits averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with million in the second quarter of and billion in the first quarter of the increase in such deposits from the second quarter of was predominantly due to deposits added late in the fourth quarter of and through the second quarter of additional brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time total uninsured deposits were estimated to be billion at june compared with billion at march billion at december and billion at june approximately billion billion billion and billion of those uninsured deposits were collateralized by the company at june march december and june respectively the

quarter of compared with billion in the first quarter of and a nominal amount in the second quarter of shortterm borrowings assumed in connection with the peoples united acquisition totaled million on april in october mt redeemed million of unsecured senior notes due to mature in december that had been assumed in the acquisition of peoples united and included in shortterm borrowings in general the increase in shortterm borrowings reflects the companys liquidity ratio management longterm borrowings averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of as of april longterm borrowings assumed in the peoples united acquisition totaled million and included million of fixedrate subordinated notes and million of fhlb

million in the second quarter of and million in the first quarter of junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million during the second and first quarters of compared with million in the second quarter of additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of june interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion exclusive of forwardstarting swap agreements were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter up basis points from in the second quarter of the yield on earning assets during the second quarter of was up basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the first quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the increases in the net interest spread since the second quarter of reflect the impact of generally rising interest rates that resulted in higher yields on loans and leases deposits at the frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates on interestbearing liabilities the federal reserve raised its target federal funds rate from march through june including various increases totaling basis points in the last half of and basis points and basis points in the first and second quarters of respectively the decline in the net interest spread in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of reflected increased demand for time deposit products higher average borrowings and the impact of competitive pricing and rising rates associated with interestbearing instruments for the first six months of the net interest spread was up basis points from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities for the first half of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial six months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the second three months of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of the lower level of average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of and second quarter of is predominantly the result of a decline in the average balance of noninterestbearing deposits noninterestbearing deposits averaged billion in the second quarter of and billion in the first quarter of compared with billion in the second quarter of the lower levels of noninterestbearing deposits in the first and second quarter of as compared with the second quarter of reflected customer use of offbalance sheet investment products and a shift in deposits to interestbearing accounts as interest rates rose during the first six months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively average noninterestbearing deposits were billion in the first half of compared with billion in the first two quarters of the decline in average noninterestbearing deposits resulting from a shift of customer funds from noninterestbearing accounts to interestbearing accounts and offbalance sheet investment products was partially offset by the impact of billion of noninterestbearing deposits the company assumed in connection with the peoples united acquisition on april shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended june compared with billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the first quarter of mt issued billion of common equity and million of preferred equity in completing the acquisition of peoples united on april repurchases of common stock totaled approximately million in the first quarter of and billion in the last three quarters of there were no repurchases of common stock during the second quarter of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in each of the second and first quarters of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter the company recorded billion of goodwill on april which represents excess consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in the peoples united transaction as part of the transaction intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value thereby increasing the balance of core deposit and other intangible assets on the companys balance sheet by million on april the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the second quarter of first quarter of and yearearlier quarter changes in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with and in the second quarter of and the first quarter of respectively the increased contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the most recent quarter and first quarter of as compared with the second quarter reflects higher rates paid on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds in the first half of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period during the first six months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads could impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin the federal open market committee has conducted a series of basis point increases in shortterm interest rates from march through june totaling those actions have led to generally higher interest rates overall and accordingly have contributed to the companys higher net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter the recent quarters net interest margin narrowed from in the first quarter of that basis point decrease reflects a basis point compression of the net interest spread partially offset by a basis point increase in the contribution of interestfree funds management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements related to cash flow hedges at june billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at june and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at june interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at june and billion at december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at june billion at june and billion at december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company also enters into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended june june and march were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the valuation of cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin

period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever cash flows associated with financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the frb of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at june and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively and shortterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively the company has benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at each of june and december compared with billion at june funding from brokered time deposits increased million and billion in the first and second quarter of respectively to billion at june from billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding at june the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services the company also has the ability to securitize or sell certain financial assets including various loan types to provide other liquidity alternatives on august moodys investor service reaffirmed mt banks shortterm deposit rating at prime1 but downgraded mts and mt banks senior and subordinated debt ratings from a3 to baa1 and mt banks longterm deposits rating from aa3 to a1 certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs there were no such securities in the trading account at june december and june the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at june million at december and million at june mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at june approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings as previously described in january mt issued billion of senior notes that mature in january outstanding senior notes of mt at june and december were billion and billion respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at june and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and regulatory expectations and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business available liquidity at june included cash on deposit at the frb of new york of billion unused lines of credit of billion and unencumbered investment securities after estimated haircut of approximately billion management continually evaluates the use and mix of its various available funding alternatives including shortterm borrowings issuance of longterm debt the placement of brokered deposits and the securitization of certain loan products management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the long term for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at june the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements related to cash flow hedges the companys assetliability committee which includes members of executive management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates june december in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes mix and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario changes in amounts presented since december reflect changes in portfolio composition including shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and higher levels of borrowings the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company amidst the rising rate environment since the first quarter of mts cumulative deposit pricing beta which is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates approximated percent excluding brokered deposits that cumulative pricing beta approximated percent the cumulative deposit pricing beta including and excluding brokered deposits is assumed to approximate to percent in the scenarios presented with interest rate increases and to approximate to percent in the scenarios presented with interest rate decreases the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes certain of the companys earning assets interestbearing liabilities preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements at june have contractual repricing terms that reference the london interbank offered rate libor the determination of libor has effectively ceased after its final publication on june in preparation for the elimination of libor as a reference rate the company essentially had discontinued entering into liborbased contracts at the end of and as of the end of the second quarter of has substantially completed its work engaging with customers and other counterparties to remediate liborbased agreements which expire after june by incorporating alternative language negotiating new agreements or other means the companys enterprisewide libor transition program has been and continues to be monitored by executive management as well as the risk committee of the board of directors at june the company had outstanding liborbased commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans of billion and residential mortgage and consumer loans of million substantially all of those loans have been amended to include appropriate alternative language effective upon cessation of libor publication and are planned to migrate to a new index generally sofr at their next scheduled reset date which except for an insignificant percentage of the companys loan portfolio is expected to occur in the third quarter of additionally mt has approximately million of variable rate junior subordinated debentures at june that as described in note of notes to financial statements in the companys s at june approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit and were junior liens with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at june approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at june march december and june included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists events posing emerging risks to the macroeconomic environment such as international conflicts and other events liquidity concerns inflation and supply chain issues are considered when developing economic forecasts even if the events do not directly and materially impact the companys financial results supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures liquidity trends or other peripheral impacts of global events may alter economic forecasts and the company monitors this activity as part of its risk management procedures in assessing the allowance for credit losses among the assumptions utilized as of june was that the national unemployment rate will average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively contract and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized as of march included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively contract and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized as of december included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable period at a average annual rate followed by a average rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of june was that the national unemployment rate would average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized were based on the information available to the company at or near june march december and june at the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages in the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate prices cumulatively decline and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at june appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at june compared with billion at june billion at december and billion at march as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at june at june at december and at march using the same methodology described herein the company added million to the allowance for credit losses related to the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april macroeconomic assumptions used to estimate credit losses on loans acquired from peoples united were consistent with those used by the company to estimate credit losses at march the combined company allowance for credit losses at april as a percentage of loans outstanding was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at june june december and march was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for
