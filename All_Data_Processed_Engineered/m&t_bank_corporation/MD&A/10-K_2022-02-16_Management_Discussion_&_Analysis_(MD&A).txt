the companys significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are described in note of notes to financial statements in applying those accounting policies management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies assumptions and estimates to be utilized certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following table start accounting for credit losses effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined under the new accounting guidance the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets including loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management in estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio borrowerspecific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period for certain loan pools that share similar risk characteristics the company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment gross domestic product and real estate prices these forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models subsequent to the forecast period the company utilizes longerterm historical loss experience to estimate table end table start losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans prior to the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in managements judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as

amounts changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods a discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements table end table start valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets such as trading assets most investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments however for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension and other postretirement benefit obligations estimated residual values of property associated with leases and certain derivative and other financial instruments these valuations require the use of various assumptions including among others discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation the company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income examples include certain investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets among others specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and

for extended periods of time and as a result many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted specifically those adverse economic impacts coupled with an accounting change noted herein

economic forecasts improved in resulting in a recapture of provision for credit losses in compared with significant provision for credit losses recorded in the prior year during economic forecasts utilized during each interim period resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january resulting in higher levels of the provision for credit losses in each of those quarters as compared with the comparable periods specifically the level of the provision in reflected the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty at december as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the us government to the economy and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where the borrowers requested repayment forbearance concerns remain about large sectors of the economy including the hotel healthcare and office space sectors the allowance for credit losses for commercial real estate loans remains elevated as a result the company expects that it will likely continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic after december specifically the company expects that the following balance sheet and income statement categories could be affected net interest income and net interest margin the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the companys net interest margin until the level of general interest rates rises provision for credit losses although the economy has experienced a recovery in it is possible that economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could deteriorate resulting in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses in addition the impact on borrowers ability to repay loans could be negatively affected potentially leading to increased chargeoffs a resurgence of the pandemic or emergence of covid19 variants in large parts of the country may impact customer demand for many of the companys products and services in particular credit and depositrelated products and services effective january mt adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance required an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount the accounting guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the

forecasts at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of december concerns persisted about the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy the emergence of new covid19 variants including the recent emerging variant commonly referred to as omicron that may further disrupt a recovery the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the us government that has contributed to increased deficit spending and raised inflation concerns disruptions to supply chains and the related impacts to

extent to which borrowers in particular commercial real estate borrowers may continue to be negatively affected by pandemicrelated and general economic conditions and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions approximately of the companys loans and leases are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania that could see lingering effects of the economic downturn the company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized a criticized loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more during and the company regraded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans based on financial results and projections of specific borrowers particularly those that were affected by covid19 impacts criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled billion at december compared with billion at december and billion at december the rise in criticized loans reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers financial condition and the regrading of loans by the company and is reflective of the provision for expected credit losses recorded by the company in as the pandemic unfolded the increases in such loans since december were largely attributable to investorowned permanent commercial real estate loans in the hotel office and healthcare sectors and commercial real estate construction loans in the hotel and healthcare sectors on the overall basis weightedaverage loantostabilized value ltv ratios for investorowned commercial real estate properties do not vary significantly by asset class or sector and at december were generally within the range of to with an overall weightedaverage ltv ratio of approximately investorowned commercial real estate loans comprised billion or of total criticized loans of billion at december the covid19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that was detrimental to many borrowers across the companys geographic regions particularly commercial borrowers in the hotel health carerelated and office sectors and residential mortgage borrowers many of these borrowers have been and could likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic covid19 related modifications with payment deferrals at december totaled billion and consisted predominantly of residential real estate loans including million of governmentguaranteed loans substantially all of those deferrals are scheduled to expire during andor are in the process of formal modification of repayment terms for previously deferred payments as commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to covid19 the company assessed loans considering the credit worthiness of the borrower collateral values the financial condition of any guarantors and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments loantocollateral values on investorowned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse loans secured by residential real estate with a covid19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrowers ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values if collectability was considered doubtful loans were classified as nonaccrual loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the companys credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the company reassessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by covid19 the companys policy is that at least annually updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed on a quarterly basis the companys centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing for criticized nonaccrual loans additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships in analyzing criticized loans borrowerspecific information is reviewed including operating results future cash flows recent developments and the borrowers outlook and other pertinent data the timing and extent of potential losses considering collateral valuation and other factors and the companys potential courses of action are contemplated with regard to residential real estate loans the companys loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the companys residential real estate loans is located for residential real estaterelated loans including home equity loans and lines of credit the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is chargedoff when the loan becomes days delinquent that chargeoff is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the company is notified of such filings at december approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company considers the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at december approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases has included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists among the assumptions utilized as of december was that the national unemployment rate will average through the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before gradually improving to in the latter half of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows during at a annual rate and during at a average rate commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of december included an estimated unemployment rate averaging through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of gross domestic product was assumed to grow at a annual rate during resulting in a return to prepandemic levels by the end of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by approximately in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly in most instances the actual macroeconomic conditions experienced in were favorable in comparison to the forecasts made at december such improvements contributed to the recapture of provision for credit losses during of million the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of the adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in gross domestic product of over the eightquarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near december december and january at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from actual events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact

the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk

would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at december the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest incomelending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes table displays as of december and the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year table sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates table start calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates december december in thousands basis points basis points basis points table end the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates increased as of december as compared with december due to the low interest rate environment and composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities in particular the increased balance of interestbearing deposits at banks table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities equally nor as assumed in the table on the contractual maturity or repricing date furthermore this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the
