significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are described in note of notes to financial statements in applying those accounting policies management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies assumptions and estimates to be utilized certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances some of the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following table start accounting for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents the amount that in managements judgment appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management in estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations historical loss trends are also considered as are economic conditions industry trends portfolio trends and borrowerspecific financial data in accounting for loans acquired at a discount that is in part attributable to credit quality and which were initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of an acquired entitys previously established allowance for credit losses the cash flows expected at acquisition in excess of estimated fair value have been recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows required the company to evaluate the need for additions to the companys allowance for credit losses subsequent improvements in expected cash flows resulted first in the recovery of any applicable allowance for credit losses and then in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could have resulted in changes in those estimates and assumptions which could have resulted in adjustment of the allowance or in the case of loans acquired at a discount increases in interest income effective january the company adopted amending accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined a discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses as well as the new accounting guidance is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements table end table start valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets such as trading assets most investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments however for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension and other postretirement benefit obligations estimated residual values of property associated with leases and certain derivative and other financial instruments these valuations require the use of various assumptions including among others discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation the company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income examples include investment securities other investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets among others specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes and of notes to financial statements table end table start commitments contingencies and offbalance sheet arrangements information regarding the companys commitments and contingencies including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation and their potential effects on the companys results of operations is included in note of notes to financial statements in addition the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record taxrelated assets or liabilities have been appropriate should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the companys results of operations information regarding the companys income taxes is presented in note of notes to financial statements the recognition or derecognition in the companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by socalled variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the companys financial interests in those entities and the degree to which the company can influence the most important activities of the entities information relating to the companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note of notes to financial statements table end overview net income for the company in

bank of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings were billion in million in and million in in december the company borrowed billion from the fhlb of new york for lcr and other liquidity purposes billion of which matured on the first business day of and billion matured on february the federal reserve and other federal bank regulators finalized the tailoring rules in october as described in part i item of this annual report on s at december approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status the balance of junior lien loans and lines that were in nonaccrual status solely as a result of first lien loan performance was million and million at december and respectively in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of estimating incurred losses in determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at december approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers in determining the allowance for credit losses the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases in quantifying incurred losses the company considers the factors and uses the techniques described herein and in note of notes to financial statements for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type the amount of specific loss components in the companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loanbyloan analysis of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows collateral values or other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay losses associated with residential real estate loans and consumer loans are generally determined by reference to recent chargeoff history and are evaluated and adjusted if deemed appropriate through consideration of other factors including nearterm forecasted loss estimates developed by the companys credit department these forecasts give consideration to overall borrower repayment performance and current geographic region changes in collateral values using third party published historical price indices or automated valuation methodologies with regard to collateral values the realizability of such values by the company contemplates repayment of any first lien position prior to recovering amounts on a junior lien position approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consists of junior lien loans and lines of credit except for consumer loans and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively and loans obtained at a discount in acquisition transactions the company considers a loan to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more and has been placed in nonaccrual status those impaired loans are evaluated for specific loss components modified loans including smaller balance homogenous loans that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of the loans expected cash flows loans less than days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for loans acquired at a discount the impact of estimated future credit losses represents the predominant difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected subsequent decreases to those expected cash flows require the company to evaluate the need for an additional allowance for credit losses and could lead to chargeoffs of acquired loan balances additional information regarding the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements the inherent base level loss components of the companys allowance for credit losses are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans under the companys loan grading system as previously described loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the companys credit policy internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the companys credit department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained loan grades are assigned loss factors that reflect the companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss factors include borrowerspecific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results collateral values financial condition payment status and other information levels of and trends in portfolio chargeoffs and recoveries levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios trends in volume and terms of loans effects of changes in credit concentrations and observed trends and practices in the banking industry in determining the allowance for credit losses management also gives consideration to such factors as customer industry and geographic concentrations as well as national and local economic conditions including i the comparatively poorer economic conditions and unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the company including upstate new york and central pennsylvania that result in such regions generally experiencing significantly lesser economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type collateral type and geographic location in particular the large concentrations of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city area and other areas of new york state and iii risk associated with the companys portfolio of consumer loans which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans the inherent base level loss components related to residential real estate loans and consumer loans are generally determined by applying loss factors to portfolio balances after consideration of payment performance and recent loss experience and trends which are mainly driven by current collateral values in the market place as well as the amount of loan defaults loss rates for loans secured by residential real estate including home equity loans and lines of credit are determined by reference to recent chargeoff history and are evaluated and adjusted if deemed appropriate through consideration of other factors as previously described in evaluating collateral the company relies on internally and externally prepared valuations residential real estate valuations are usually based on sales of comparable properties in the respective location commercial real estate valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many assumptions and as a result can be highly subjective specifically commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions and interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property additionally management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans and as a result in changes to assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality accordingly loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends the federal reserve stated in december that the us labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate job gains have been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low although household spending has been rising at a strong pace business fixed investment and exports remain weak economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the company also showed improvement in for example in average private sector employment in areas served by the company was above yearago levels but still trailed the us average growth rate private sector employment increased in upstate new york in areas of pennsylvania served by the company in new jersey in maryland in greater washington dc and in delaware in new york city private sector employment increased by in the specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed in addition the company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable the inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance and other risks associated with the companys loan portfolio which may not be specifically allocable a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five yearends is presented in table amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each yearend assessment and using the methodology described herein variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components including the impact of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to of gross loans outstanding at each of december and december considering the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit losses given the companys high concentration of real estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed herein management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable furthermore the companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category additional information about the allowance for credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements table allocation of the allowance for credit losses to loan categories table start december in thousands commercial financial leasing etc real estate consumer unallocated total as

reflected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at december and billion at each of december and december as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at each of december and and at december the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans at the end of and was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of chargingoff loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date in establishing the allowance for credit losses management follows the methodology described herein including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans the establishment of the allowance is subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower industry regional and national economic health and performance in order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors the company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit

under the assumptions for credit deterioration whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a million reduction could occur these examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors the company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans at december however residential real estate loans comprised approximately of the loan portfolio outstanding loans to foreign borrowers aggregated million at december or of total loans and leases effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the amended guidance also requires recording an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a morethaninsignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination the initial allowance for these assets will be added to the purchase price at acquisition rather than being reported as an expense subsequent changes in the allowance will be recorded through the income statement as an expense adjustment the new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses at january increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans reflecting the longerdated maturities of such portfolios were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the company could require full repayment of such loans in the nearterm

either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at december the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest incomelending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and non parallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes table displays as of december and the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year table sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates table start calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income december changes in interest rates in thousands basis points basis points basis points table end the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain positive on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates lessened as of december as compared with a year earlier as the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to declining interest rates in light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process the amounts presented in the table are not considered significant to the companys past or projected net interest income table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities equally nor as assumed in the table on the contractual maturity or repricing date furthermore this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the

fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented herein under the heading capital and in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account the fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to a welldefined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by mts board of directors however as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys trading account activities the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled billion at december and billion at december the notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were billion and million at december and respectively although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were million and million respectively at december and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively and at december by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the higher balance of trading account assets at december was largely the result of increased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments included in trading account assets at each of december and were million of assets related to deferred compensation plans changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at

liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the company was required to hold under terms of certain nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million and million at december and december respectively given the companys policies limits and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys trading account activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note of notes to financial

of million on securities with an amortized cost of billion information concerning the companys fair valuations of investment securities is provided in note of notes to financial statements each reporting period the company reviews its investment securities for otherthantemporary impairment for debt securities the company analyzes the creditworthiness of the issuer or reviews the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond for debt securities backed by pools of loans such as privately issued mortgagebacked securities the company estimates the cash flows of the underlying loan collateral using forwardlooking assumptions for default rates loss severities and prepayment speeds estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to estimate bondspecific cash flows to determine the ultimate collectibility of the bond if the present value of the cash flows indicates that the company should not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a bond or if the company intends to sell the bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell the bond before recovery of its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment loss is recognized if an otherthantemporary impairment loss is deemed to have occurred the investment securitys cost basis is adjusted as appropriate for the circumstances as of december based on a review of each of the securities in the investment securities portfolio the company concluded that the declines in the values of any securities containing an unrealized loss were temporary and that any additional otherthantemporary impairment charges were not appropriate at december the company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its impaired securities that is where fair value is less than the cost basis of the security the company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the cost basis of those securities to become otherthantemporarily impaired however because the unrealized losses on availableforsale investment securities have generally already been reflected in the financial statement values for investment securities and shareholders equity any recognition of an otherthantemporary decline in value of those investment securities would not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial condition any otherthantemporary impairment charge related to heldtomaturity securities would result in reductions in the financial statement values for investment securities and shareholders equity additional information concerning fair value measurements and the companys approach to the classification of such measurements is included in note of notes to financial statements the company assessed impairment losses on privately issued mortgagebacked securities in the heldtomaturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bondspecific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity these bondspecific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels in total at december and the company had in its heldtomaturity portfolio privately issued mortgagebacked securities with an amortized cost basis of million and million respectively and a fair value of million and million respectively at december of the mortgagebacked securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure with being independently rated as investment grade the mortgagebacked securities are generally collateralized by residential and smallbalance commercial real estate loans originated between and and had a weightedaverage credit enhancement of at december calculated by dividing the remaining unpaid principal balance of bonds subordinate to the bonds owned by the company plus any overcollateralization remaining in the securitization structure by the remaining unpaid principal balance of all bonds in the securitization structure the weightedaverage default percentage and loss severity assumptions utilized in the companys internal modeling were and respectively given the terms of the securitization structure some of the bonds held by the company may defer interest payments in certain circumstances but after considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual senior and subordinate tranche bond the company has concluded that as of december those privately issued mortgagebacked securities were not otherthantemporarily impaired nevertheless it is possible that adverse changes in the future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the companys conclusions adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans net of applicable tax effect reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by million or per common share at december million
