described in note of notes to financial statements in applying those accounting policies management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies assumptions and estimates to be utilized certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following accounting for credit losses effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined under that accounting guidance the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets including loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management in estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio borrowerspecific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period for certain loan pools that share similar risk characteristics the company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment gross domestic product and real estate prices these forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models subsequent to the forecast period the company utilizes longerterm historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods a discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements prior to the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in managements judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets such as investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments however for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension and other postretirement benefit obligations estimated residual values of property associated with leases and certain derivative and other financial instruments these valuations require the use of various assumptions including among others discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation the company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income examples include certain investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets among others specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes and of notes to financial statements commitments contingencies and offbalance sheet arrangements information regarding the companys commitments and contingencies including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation and their potential effects on the companys results of operations is included in note of notes to financial statements in addition the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record taxrelated assets or liabilities have been appropriate should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the companys results of operations information regarding the companys income taxes is presented in note of notes to financial statements the recognition or derecognition in the companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by socalled variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the companys financial interests in those entities and the degree to which the company can influence the most important activities of the entities information

with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of december concerns existed about the somewhat incomplete recovery evident in some sectors of the economy elevated levels of inflation fears of a slowing economy and possible recession in the volatile nature of global markets and international economic conditions that could impact the us economy federal reserve positioning of monetary policy downward pressures on commercial and residential real estate values ongoing supply chain issues and wage pressures impacting commercial borrowers the extent to which borrowers in particular commercial real estate borrowers may be negatively affected by pandemicrelated and general economic conditions and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate new york and pennsylvania regions approximately of the companys loans and leases are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania that historically lag other regions of the country the company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized a criticized loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more in response to changed conditions stemming from the pandemic and other economic factors the company regraded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans based on financial results and projections of specific borrowers criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled billion including billion of loans acquired from peoples united at december compared with billion at december and billion at december despite improved economic conditions during much of as compared with as pandemicrelated restrictions continued to be lifted and consumer spending increased the business climate continues to be subjected to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints the level of criticized loans remains reflective of the impact of current conditions on many borrowers particularly those with investorowned commercial real estate loans in the hotel office and healthcare sectors investorowned commercial real estate loans comprised billion or of total criticized loans of billion at december the weightedaverage loantovalue ltv ratios for investorowned commercial real estate properties was approximately criticized loans secured by investorowned commercial real estate had a weightedaverage ltv ratio of approximately line of business personnel in different geographic locations with the support of the companys credit risk personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the companys policy is that at least annually updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed on a quarterly basis the companys centralized credit risk department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing for criticized nonaccrual loans additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships in analyzing criticized loans borrowerspecific information is reviewed including operating results future cash flows recent developments and the borrowers outlook and other pertinent data the timing and extent of potential losses considering collateral valuation and other factors and the companys potential courses of action are contemplated with regard to residential real estate loans the companys loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the companys residential real estate loans is located for residential real estaterelated loans including home equity loans and lines of credit the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is chargedoff when the loan becomes days delinquent that chargeoff is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the company is notified of such filings at december approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit and were junior liens with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company considers the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at december approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at december and included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists the assumptions utilized as of december included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a average rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of december was that the national unemployment rate would average through the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before gradually improving to in the latter half of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grew during at a annual rate and during at a average rate commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of december included an estimated unemployment rate averaging through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of gross domestic product was assumed to grow at a annual rate during resulting in a return to prepandemic levels by the end of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by approximately in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly in most instances the actual macroeconomic conditions experienced in were favorable in comparison to the forecasts made at december such improvements contributed to the recapture of provision for credit losses during of million the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of the adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in gross domestic product of over the eightquarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near december and january at the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages in the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate declines to approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate prices cumulatively rise and residential real estate prices cumulatively contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements prior to the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in managements judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the allowance was determined by managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the current financial condition of specific borrowers the current economic environment in which borrowers operate the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications the estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to did not

anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the long term for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at december the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest incomelending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of executive management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes table displays as of december and the estimated impact on net interest income in the base

rates table start calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates december december in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points a table end a the company did not analyze this scenario as of december the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve changes in the amounts presented since december reflect higher balances of earnings assets obtained in the peoples united acquisition changes in portfolio composition the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities equally nor as assumed in the table on the contractual maturity or repricing date furthermore this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit

continues to work with its customers and other counterparties to remediate liborbased agreements which expire after june by incorporating alternative language negotiating new agreements or other means the discontinuation of libor and uncertainty relating to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indexes to replace libor could materially impact the companys interest rate risk profile and its management thereof in addition to the effect of interest rates changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in

nonhedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities the fair values of nonhedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option
