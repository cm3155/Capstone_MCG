impacted by multiple hikes by the fomc of its federal funds target rate totaling from march of through september of in response to inflationary pressures the higher interest rate environment has resulted in increased yields on the companys earning assets higher costs of interestbearing liabilities and a shift in the mix of those liabilities including from noninterestbearing deposits to higher cost deposit products the provision for credit losses reflects continued downward pressure on commercial real estate values the company recognized a gain on the sale of a trustrelated business in the second quarter of a summary of financial results for the company is provided below summary of financial results three months ended percent change from nine months ended september september june third

impact of mergerrelated expenses associated with mts acquisition of peoples united for the three and ninemonth periods ended september was million million pretax or of diluted earnings per common share and million million pretax or of diluted earnings per common share respectively the company did not incur any mergerrelated expenses during net income increased million to million in the third quarter of from million in the third quarter of as compared with the third quarter of taxableequivalent net interest income increased million reflecting higher yields on earnings assets partially offset by higher costs of interestbearing liabilities the net interest margin expanded basis points to in the third quarter of from in the corresponding quarter of the provision for credit losses was million higher in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter reflecting a softening of commercial real estate values mergerrelated expenses of million were recognized in the third quarter of net income in the recent quarter declined million from million in the second quarter of as compared with the second quarter of taxableequivalent net interest income declined million as rising costs on interestbearing liabilities outpaced higher yields on earnings assets the net interest margin narrowed basis points in the recent quarter from in the second quarter of noninterest income in the third quarter of declined million from the second quarter of reflecting a million gain on the sale of the companys cit business in april and lower citrelated trust income as a result of that sale noninterest expense declined million due largely to lower salaries and employee benefits expenses for the first nine months of net income increased billion to billion as compared with billion in the comparable period the largest contributors to that increase were one additional quarter of operations acquired from peoples united in the first nine months of and higher yields on earning assets during that same period partially offset by rising costs of interestbearing liabilities the net interest margin expanded basis points to in the first nine months of from in the yearearlier period reflecting a decline in commercial real estate values the provision for credit losses for the first nine months of was million the provision for credit losses in the first nine

income earned on certain of the companys assets is exempt from federal income tax taxableequivalent net interest income is a nongaap measure that adjusts income earned on a taxexempt asset to present it on an equivalent basis to interest income earned on a fully taxable asset expressed on a taxableequivalent basis net interest income increased million to billion in the third quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter that increase reflects an basis point hundredths of one percent expansion of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier quarter the higher net interest margin was influenced by a rising interest rate environment resulting from actions taken by the federal reserve to mitigate inflationary pressures on the us economy the fomc raised its target federal funds rate through multiple hikes totaling from march through september which led to higher yields on loans deposits at the frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates paid on interestbearing deposits and borrowings taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined from billion in the second quarter of reflecting a basis point narrowing of the net interest margin from in the second quarter of as a rise in the cost of interestbearing liabilities outpaced the increase in yields on earning assets interestbearing liabilities in the recent quarter increased billion to billion compared with billion in the second quarter of average earning assets increased billion to billion in the recent quarter from billion in 2023s second quarter for the first nine months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion up from billion recognized in the corresponding period the increase was primarily attributable to the higher level of average earning assets and a basis point expansion of the net interest margin to in the period from in the yearearlier period partially offset by an increase in average interestbearing liabilities the increase in average earning assets in the first nine months of includes the impact of one additional quarter from earning assets obtained in the peoples united transaction on april commercial loan growth and purchases of investment securities partially offset by lower deposits at the frb of new york the increase in average interestbearing liabilities reflects interestbearing liabilities assumed in the peoples united acquisition and a continued shift in customer deposits toward higher cost interestbearing products including time deposits and higher average borrowings average loans and leases totaled billion in the third quarter of up billion or from billion in the similar quarter of commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the recent quarter up billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter that increase predominantly reflects growth in loans to financial and insurance industry customers and loans to motorvehicle and recreational finance dealers average commercial real estate loans decreased billion or to billion in the

million or from billion in the yearearlier quarter that growth reflected higher average balances of million and million in mts portfolio of recreational finance loans and credit cards respectively partially offset by declines of million and million in average balances of automobile loans and home equity loans and lines of credit respectively average loan and lease balances in the third quarter of decreased million from billion in the second quarter of the lower balances resulted predominantly from a million decline in average commercial real estate loans from billion in the second quarter

recreational finance automobile home equity lines and loans other total consumer total for the first nine months of average loans and leases totaled billion up from billion in the corresponding period loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition and growth in commercial and consumer real estate loans were the predominant reasons for that increase partially offset by lower average balances of commercial real estate loans and ppp loans the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the third quarter of up billion from billion in the third quarter of and million lower than the billion averaged in 2023s second quarter the higher average balance in the recent quarter when compared with the yearearlier quarter reflects the purchase of billion of investment securities during the twelvemonth period ended september those purchases were predominantly fixed rate mortgagebacked securities as compared with the second quarter of the decrease relates to pay downs of fixed rate mortgagebacked securities for the first nine months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively in addition to the purchases described herein billion of investment securities obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april contributed to the increase in average investment securities during the first nine months of as compared with the first nine months of there were no significant sales of investment securities during the nine months ended september and the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the fhlb of new york and the frb of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury and federal agency notes but also includes municipal securities and commercial real estate mortgagebacked securities when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of movements in interest rates and spreads changes in liquidity needs actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized gains and losses on such equity securities were not significant in each of the first nine months of and the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the nine months ended september or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of september the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended september september and june respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at those respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the frb of new york in general the amount of deposits held at the frb of new york is influenced by the companys liquidity and interest rate management activities and fluctuates with changes in levels of the companys investments loans deposits and other borrowings the lower balance in the recent quarter compared with the yearearlier quarter reflects loan portfolio growth the purchases of investment securities and treasury stock in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of and a decline in noninterest bearing deposits partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt in the first quarter of and other shortterm borrowings and an increase in time deposits as compared with the second quarter of the higher balance reflects increased liquidity from a rise in average deposits partially offset by lower average loans and leases and a decline in average investment securities balances as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first nine months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the similar quarter and billion in the second quarter of the decrease in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter was primarily the result of monetary tightening that influenced customers to seek higher rate alternatives including a shift from operating demand accounts to offbalance sheet sweep accounts for commercial customers lower levels of activity in the capital markets also resulted in a reduction of trust demand deposits as compared with the second quarter of the modest increase in average core deposits reflects the companys focus on retaining and growing customer deposits including targeted promotions in competitive markets the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent change from third quarter third quarter second quarter in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over and brokered deposits time deposits over averaged billion in the recent quarter compared with million in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of the increase in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the third quarter of reflects higher demand for time deposit products in a rising interest rate environment the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts that averaged billion during the recent quarter and billion in each of the yearearlier quarter and the second quarter of brokered time deposits averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with million in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of the increase in such deposits from the third quarter of reflected the companys liquidity management and funding strategies during a period of rising interest rates and was predominantly due to deposits added late in the fourth quarter of and through the second quarter of additional brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time total uninsured deposits were estimated to be billion at september compared with billion at june billion at december and billion at september approximately billion billion billion and billion of those uninsured deposits were collateralized by the company at september june december and september respectively the accompanying table summarizes average total deposits for the quarters ended september june and september average deposits retail trust commercial and other total in millions three months ended september savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total three months ended june savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total three months ended september savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also uses borrowings from banks the fhlb of new york the frb of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings totaled billion in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of shortterm borrowings assumed in connection with the peoples united acquisition totaled million on april in october mt redeemed million of unsecured senior notes due to mature in december that had been assumed in the acquisition of peoples united and included in shortterm borrowings in general the higher levels of shortterm borrowings in the third and second quarters of as compared with the yearearlier quarter reflect the companys management of liquidity the billion decline in average shortterm borrowings in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of was coincident with an increase in comparatively lower cost average brokered deposits described herein longterm borrowings averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of in august a subsidiary of mt bank that specializes in equipment financing issued million of assetbacked notes secured by equipment finance loans and leases at a weighted average interest rate of average balances of the companys outstanding senior notes were billion billion and billion during the three months ended september september and june respectively in july million of fixed and variable senior notes of mt matured in january mt issued billion of senior notes that

in january and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until maturity and billion of senior notes that mature in january and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until maturity in november mt bank issued million of fixed rate senior notes that pay a rate of semiannually and mature in november in august mt issued million of senior notes that mature in august and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until august after which sofr plus will be paid quarterly until maturity during may million of variable rate senior notes of mt bank matured in april mt bank redeemed million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on may as of april longterm borrowings assumed in the peoples united acquisition totaled million and included million of fixedrate subordinated notes and million of fhlb advances subordinated capital notes included in longterm borrowings averaged million in each of the second and third quarters of compared with million in the third quarter of junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million during the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the second quarter of additional information regarding borrowings is provided in notes and of notes to financial statements and in the annual report in october mt issued million of senior notes that mature in october and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until october after which sofr plus will be paid quarterly until maturity the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of september interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion exclusive of forwardstarting swap agreements were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter down basis points from in the third quarter of the yield on earning assets during the third quarter of was up basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the second quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the continued decline in the net interest spread in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of and third quarter of reflects the impact of higher rates paid on interestbearing liabilities predominantly interestbearing deposits resulting from a general rise in interest rates and increased competition for deposits partially offset by higher yields on loans and leases deposits at the frb of new york and investment securities the fomc raised its target federal funds rate with a series of rate hikes totaling from march through september for the first nine months of the net interest spread was relatively unchanged from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities for the first nine months of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial nine months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of the lower level of average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter and the second quarter of as compared with the third quarter of is predominantly the result of a decline in the average balance of noninterestbearing deposits noninterestbearing deposits averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of the decline in average noninterestbearing deposits since the third quarter of reflects customer use of offbalance sheet investment products and a shift in deposits to interestbearing accounts as interest rates rose during the first nine months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively average noninterestbearing deposits were billion in the first nine months of compared with billion in the first three quarters of that decline in average noninterestbearing deposits resulted from a shift of customer funds from noninterestbearing accounts to interestbearing accounts and offbalance sheet investment products the company assumed billion of noninterestbearing deposits in connection with the peoples united acquisition on april shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended september compared with billion during each of the yearearlier quarter and the second quarter of mt issued billion of common equity and million of preferred equity in completing the acquisition of peoples united on april repurchases of common stock totaled approximately million inclusive of the share repurchase excise tax in the first quarter of and billion in the last three quarters of there were no repurchases of common stock during the second and third quarters of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in each of the third quarter of and second quarter of the company recorded billion of goodwill on april which represents excess consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in the peoples united transaction as part of the transaction intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value thereby increasing the balance of core deposit and other intangible assets on the companys balance sheet by million on april the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the third quarter of second quarter of and yearearlier third quarter changes in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with and in the third quarter of and the second quarter of respectively the increased contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the most recent quarter and second quarter of as compared with the third quarter reflects higher rates paid on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds in the first nine months of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads could impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin the fomc has conducted a series of basis point increases in shortterm interest rates from march through september totaling those actions have led to generally higher interest rates overall and accordingly have contributed to the companys higher net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter the recent quarters net interest margin narrowed from in the second quarter of that basis point decrease reflects a basis point compression of the net interest spread partially offset by a basis point increase in the contribution of interestfree funds during the first nine months of and the net interest margin was and respectively management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements related to cash flow hedges at september billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at september interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at september and billion at december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at september and billion at each of september and december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company also enters into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended september september and june were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the valuation of cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional

period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever cash flows associated with financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through secured borrowings from the fhlb of new york and the frb of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has in the past issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at september and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively and shortterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively the company has benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at september billion at december and billion at september funding from brokered time deposits increased billion in the first nine months of to billion at september from billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding at september the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services the company also has the ability to securitize or sell certain financial assets including various loan types to provide other liquidity alternatives on august moodys investor service reaffirmed mt banks shortterm deposit rating at prime1 but downgraded mts and mt banks senior and subordinated debt ratings from a3 to baa1 and mt banks longterm deposits rating from aa3 to a1 certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs there were no such securities in the trading account at september december and september the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at september million at december and million at september mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at september approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings in september mt commenced its mediumterm note program under which mt may issue from time to time senior and subordinated mediumterm notes as previously described in january mt issued billion of senior notes that mature in january and in july million of senior notes matured in october mt issued million of fixed rate to floating rate senior notes that mature in october outstanding senior notes of mt at september and december were billion and billion respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at september and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and regulatory expectations and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business available liquidity at september included cash on deposit at the frb of new york of billion unused secured borrowing facilities of billion and unencumbered investment securities after estimated haircut of approximately billion management continually evaluates the use and mix of its various available funding alternatives including shortterm borrowings issuance of longterm debt the placement of brokered deposits and the securitization of certain loan products management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the long term for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at september the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements related to cash flow hedges the companys assetliability committee which includes members of executive management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates september december in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes mix and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario changes in amounts presented since december reflect changes in portfolio composition including shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and higher levels of borrowings the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company amidst the rising interest rate environment since the first quarter of mts cumulative deposit pricing beta which is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates approximated percent excluding brokered deposits that cumulative pricing beta approximated percent the cumulative deposit pricing beta including and excluding brokered deposits is assumed to approximate to percent in the interest rate scenarios presented the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes certain of the companys earning assets interestbearing liabilities preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements historically referenced libor the determination of libor has effectively ceased after its final publication on june in preparation for the elimination of libor as a reference rate the company essentially had discontinued entering into liborbased contracts at the end of at september substantially all customer and other counterparty financial instruments have been transitioned to a new index generally sofr through the amendment of preexisting agreements to include appropriate alternative language effective upon cessation of libor publication negotiating new agreements or other means the outstanding amount of loans and leases that continue to reference libor at september was not significant prior to its cessation many of the companys interest rate swap agreements referenced libor in october the international swaps and derivatives association inc published the supplement and the protocol the protocol enabled market participants to incorporate certain revisions into their legacy noncleared derivative trades with other counterparties that also chose to adhere to the protocol mt adhered to the protocol in november with respect to the companys cleared interest rate swap agreements that referenced libor clearinghouses have adopted the same sofr benchmark alternatives of the supplement and protocol all of the companys liborbased interest rate swap agreements at september have reset to a suitable alternative index primarily sofr in addition to the effect of interest rates changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts to meet the financial needs of customers that it includes in its financial statements as other nonhedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities the fair values of nonhedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk

troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of september concerns existed about elevated levels of inflation fears of liquidity shortages and tightening credit in the financial services markets and a slowing economy or possible recession in coming quarters the volatile nature of global markets and international economic conditions that could impact the us economy federal reserve positioning of monetary policy downward pressures on commercial and residential real estate values especially in the office and healthcare sectors rising interest rates and wage pressures impacting commercial borrowers the extent to which borrowers in particular commercial real estate borrowers may be negatively affected by general economic conditions and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions approximately of the companys loans and leases are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania that historically lag other regions of the country the company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized a criticized loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer

line of business personnel in different geographic locations with support from and review by the companys credit risk personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the companys policy is that at least annually updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed on a quarterly basis the companys credit personnel review all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing for criticized nonaccrual loans additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships in analyzing criticized loans borrowerspecific information is reviewed including operating results future cash flows recent developments and the borrowers outlook and other pertinent data the timing and extent of potential losses considering collateral valuation and other factors and the companys potential courses of action are contemplated with regard to residential real estate loans the companys loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the companys residential real estate loans is located for residential real estaterelated loans including home equity loans and lines of credit the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is chargedoff when the loan becomes days delinquent that chargeoff is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the company is notified of such filings at september approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit and were junior liens with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for chargeoff and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at september approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also commercial and residential real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at september june december and september included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists events posing emerging risks to the macroeconomic environment such as international conflicts and other events liquidity concerns inflation and supply chain issues are considered when developing economic forecasts even if the events do not directly and materially impact the companys financial results supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures liquidity trends or other peripheral impacts of global events may alter economic forecasts and the company monitors this activity as part of its risk management procedures in assessing the allowance for credit losses among the assumptions utilized as of september was that the national unemployment rate will average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively contract and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized as of june included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively contract and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized as of december included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable period at a annual rate followed by a rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of september was that the national unemployment rate would average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow at a rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate values were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized were based on the information available to the company at or near the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages during the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate prices cumulatively decline and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at september appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at september compared with billion at each of september and at december and billion at june as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at september at each of september and december and at june using the same methodology described herein the company added million to the allowance for credit losses related to the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april the combined company allowance for credit losses at april as a percentage of loans outstanding was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at september september december and june was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses
