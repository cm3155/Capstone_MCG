item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information included in this quarterly report on s limited documentation first lien mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans the company no longer originates limited documentation loans with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for chargeoff and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company considers the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral

hampshire rhode island and vermont factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers a comparative summary of consumer loans in nonaccrual status by product is presented in the following table nonaccrual consumer loans dollars in millions september december home equity lines and loans recreational finance automobile other total allowance for credit losses management determines the allowance for credit losses under accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note of notes to financial statements in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of september concerns existed about the impact of elevated levels of inflation and potential increases in unemployment on the discretionary income and purchasing power of consumer borrowers slower economic growth in future quarters the volatile nature of global markets and international economic conditions that could impact the us economy federal reserve positioning of monetary policy including the effects of liquidity in financial markets downward pressures on commercial real estate values especially in the office sector elevated interest rates and wage pressures impacting commercial borrowers including nonautomotive finance dealers and the extent to which borrowers may be negatively affected by general economic conditions the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at each period end reporting date included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario review committee which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists the assumptions utilized as of september june and december are presented in the following table and were based on information available at or near the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates allowance for credit losses macroeconomic assumptions september june december year year cumulative year year cumulative year year cumulative

also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gdp commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forwardlooking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following

economic scenario potential upside economic scenario these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management has assessed that the allowance for credit losses at september appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at each of september and june compared with billion at december as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding the allowance was at september at june and at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding since december reflects a higher level of credit losses expected on certain commercial borrowers and growth in consumer recreational finance loans included in the allocation of the allowance for credit losses were reserves for loans secured by office properties of at september at june and at december the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date furthermore the companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at september june and december was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance

resolution of an income tax matter inherited from the acquisition of peoples united the effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pretax income the amount of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the company operates because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items the companys effective tax rate in future periods may also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the companys interpretations by any of the various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by mt or any of its subsidiaries liquidity risk as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever cash flows associated with financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others core deposits totaled billion at september and billion at december the increase in core deposits since december reflects higher savings and interestchecking deposits including higher transitory commercial and institutional services deposits near the end of the recent quarter partially offset by lower noninterestbearing deposits as customers shifted funds to interestbearing accounts in an elevated interest rate environment the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased repurchase agreements advances from fhlbs brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through secured borrowings from the fhlb of new york and the frb of new york mt bank is also a counterparty to the frb of new york standing repurchase agreement facility which allows it to enter into overnight repurchase transactions using eligible investment securities the company has in the past issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios at september and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively and shortterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively information about the companys borrowings is presented in note of notes to financial statements the companys wholesale funding sources include the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated billion at september and billion at december reflecting a mix shift in the companys wholesale funding strategy brokered time deposits totaled billion at september down billion from billion at december as brokered time deposits matured approximately of brokered time deposits at september have a contractual maturity date in the next months total uninsured deposits were estimated to be billion at september and billion at december approximately billion and billion of those uninsured deposits were collateralized by the company at september and december respectively the company maintains available liquidity sources which represent approximately of uninsured deposits that are not collateralized by the company at september the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such risks by conducting scenario analyses that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a debt ratings downgrade and other market events such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at september approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt may also obtain funding through longterm borrowings further information about the longterm outstanding borrowings of mt is provided in note of notes to financial statements as a bank holding company mt is obligated to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to its bank subsidiaries as described in part i item business in mts annual report as its ability to access the capital markets may be affected by market disruptions mt maintains sufficient cash resources at its parent company to satisfy projected cash outflows for an extended period without reliance on dividends from subsidiaries or external financing as of september mts parent company liquidity covered projected cash outflows for months including dividends on common and preferred stock debt service and scheduled debt maturities in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities and repayments of investment securities loans and other earning assets as well as cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services the company also has the ability to securitize or sell certain financial assets including various loan types to provide other liquidity alternatives us treasury and federal agency securities and government issued or guaranteed mortgagebacked securities comprised of the companys debt securities portfolio at september the weightedaverage durations of debt investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at september were years and years respectively the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements the companys executive alco committee closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and regulatory expectations as a category iv institution the company adheres to enhanced liquidity standards which require the performance of internal liquidity stress testing the stress testing is designed to ensure the company has sufficient liquidity to withstand both institutionspecific and marketwide stress scenarios for each scenario the company applies liquidity stress which may include deposit runoff increased draws on unfunded loan commitments increased collateral need for margin calls increased haircuts on investment securitybased funding and reductions in unsecured and secured borrowing capacity stress scenarios are measured over various time frames ranging from overnight to twelve months as required by regulation the company maintains a liquidity buffer comprised of cash and highly liquid unencumbered securities to cover a 30day stress horizon liquidity stress events occurring over longer time horizons can be mitigated by the availability of secured funding sources at the fhlb of new york and frb of new york the following table is a summary of the companys available sources of liquidity at september and december available liquidity sources dollars in millions september december deposits at the frb of new york unused secured borrowing facilities frb of new york fhlb of new york unencumbered investment securities after estimated haircuts total management continuously evaluates the use and mix of its various available funding alternatives including shortterm borrowings issuances of longterm debt the placement of brokered deposits and the securitization of certain loan products management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the long term for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks in accordance with liquidity regulations the company maintains a contingency funding plan to facilitate ongoing liquidity management in times of liquidity stress the plan outlines various funding options available during a liquidity stress event and establishes a clear escalation protocol to be followed within the companys risk management framework the plan sets forth funding strategies and procedures that management can quickly leverage to assist in decisionmaking and specifies roles and responsibilities for departments impacted by a potential liquidity stress event market risk and interest rate sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at september the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements designated for hedging purposes information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest margin and in note of notes to financial statements the companys executive alco committee monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that contemplate both parallel that is when interest rates at each point of the yield curve change by the same magnitude and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to change by different amounts shifts in the yield curve the company also contemplates instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve over the scenario time horizon in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from changes in market interest rates the scenarios presented in the table below assume a gradual and parallel change in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income dollars in millions september december changes in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes mix and pricing and deposit maturities changes in amounts presented since december reflect changes in portfolio composition including purchases of investment securities shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposit products lower levels of brokered time deposits and shortterm borrowings and higher levels of longterm borrowings the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company mts cumulative deposit pricing beta which is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates approximated percent amidst a rising interest rate environment from the first quarter of through the second quarter of reflecting the first cut of the federal funds target interest rate since march the fomc decreased that rate by basis points on september the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes management also uses an economic value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above and provide a longterm interest rate risk metric economic value of equity is a pointintime analysis of the economic sensitivity of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives management measures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios including immediate shifts of the yield curve in addition to the effect of interest rates changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets information about the fair valuation of financial instruments is presented in note of notes to financial statements the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts to meet the financial needs of customers that it includes in its consolidated financial statements as other nonhedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities the fair values of nonhedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to its nonhedging derivative activities although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of such nonhedging derivative assets and liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet were million and million respectively at september and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at september have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the amounts associated with the companys nonhedging derivative activities at september and december reflect changes in values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments trading account assets were million at september and million at

that the company was required to hold under terms of certain nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million at each of september and december given the companys policies and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account and other nonhedging derivative activities was not material at september however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys actions to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities information about the companys use of derivative financial
