mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income aggregated million in the first quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share for the first three months of and were and respectively net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were million and respectively in the fourth quarter net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was compared with in the first quarter of and in 2022s fourth quarter net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of in the first quarter of in the yearearlier quarter and in the fourth quarter of reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income net interest income expressed on a taxableequivalent basis was billion in the first quarter of more than double the million recorded in the yearearlier

expansion of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier quarter that increase reflected a rising interest rate environment resulting from actions taken by the federal reserve to mitigate inflationary pressures on the us economy the federal reserve raised its target federal funds rate through multiple hikes totaling since the end of the first quarter of that led to higher yields on loans deposits at the federal reserve bank frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates paid on interestbearing deposits and borrowings taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter was little changed from billion in the fourth quarter of the modest decline reflects two fewer days in the first quarter of as compared with 2022s final quarter while the impact of a slightly lower net interest margin was offset by a billion

average commercial real estate loans increased billion or to billion in the first quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter that increase also reflects the impact of loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united partially offset by a reduction in average balances of legacy loans reflecting repayments by customers average residential real estate loans increased billion or to billion in the first quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter the growth in residential real estate loans was largely attributable to the acquisition of loans from peoples united and mts decision in the third quarter of to retain rather than sell most originated residential mortgage loans mt returned to originating for sale the majority of its newly committed residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of consumer loans averaged billion in the first quarter of up billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter consumer loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united

secured by recreational vehicles and boats was partially offset by a decline of million in average balances of automobile loans average loan and lease balances in the first quarter of increased billion from billion in the fourth quarter of the higher balances resulted predominantly from growth in commercial loans and leases which increased billion from billion in the fourth quarter of that growth resulted from a broadbased increase in commercial loans and leases of billion and average dealer floor plan balances of million average commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of

consumer recreational finance automobile home equity lines and loans other total consumer total the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the first quarter of up billion from billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion higher than the billion averaged in the fourth quarter of the higher average balance when compared with the yearearlier quarter reflects the acquisition of peoples united which added approximately billion to the investment securities portfolio on april and the purchase of billion of investment securities during the twelvemonth period ended march those purchases were predominantly us treasury notes and fixed rate mortgagebacked securities when compared with the fourth quarter of the increase relates to purchases of approximately billion of investment securities during the recent quarter consisting predominantly of fixed rate mortgagebacked securities there were no significant sales of investment securities during the three months ended march march or december the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the frb of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury and federal agency notes but also includes municipal securities and commercial real estate mortgagebacked securities when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized losses on such equity securities were less than million in the first quarters of and compared with million in the fourth quarter of those losses include changes in the value of the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the first quarters of or or in the final quarter based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of march the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the frb of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended march march and december respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the frb of new york the lower balances in the recent quarter and the fourth quarter of compared with the yearearlier quarter reflect actions taken by the company including the purchases of investment securities and treasury stock and the management of select deposit relationships designed to reduce the balances of highercost deposit accounts partially offset by the issuance of debt and other shortterm borrowings in general the level of deposits held at the frb of new york also fluctuates due to changes in deposits of commercial entities trustrelated deposits and additions to or maturities of investment securities or borrowings as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the first quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the first quarter of up from billion in the similar quarter but down from billion in the fourth quarter of the peoples united acquisition added approximately billion of core deposits on april including billion of savings and interestchecking deposits billion of time deposits and billion of noninterestbearing deposits the increase in core deposits resulting from the acquisition of peoples united in was partially offset by the companys efforts in to reduce historically highercost deposits as well as customer reactions to the generally rising interest rate environment the decline in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of includes the impact of seasonal decreases customer use of offbalance sheet investment products and lower levels of activity in the capital markets resulting in a reduction of trust demand and other deposits additionally the company experienced a shift of commercial customer deposits out of operating demand accounts into on and offbalance sheet sweep accounts to earn higher returns amid rising rates similarly certain retail customers moved balances from savings and interestchecking accounts to time deposits in response to rising interest rates the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from 1st qtr 1st qtr 4th qtr in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over and brokered deposits time deposits over averaged billion in the recent quarter compared with million in the first quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the increase in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of included the impact of the acquisition of peoples united and higher demand for time deposit products as interest rates rose since the first quarter of the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts that averaged billion during the recent quarter billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of brokered time deposits averaged billion in the first quarter of compared with million in the fourth quarter of the increase was predominantly due to deposits added late in the fourth quarter of there were no brokered time deposits in the yearearlier quarter additional brokered deposits may be added in the future depending on market conditions including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time total uninsured deposits were estimated to be billion at march

from banks the fhlb of new york the frb of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings totaled billion in the first quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of shortterm borrowings from the fhlb averaged billion in the first quarter of compared with billion in the fourth quarter of there were no such borrowings outstanding in the initial quarter of shortterm borrowings assumed in connection with the peoples united acquisition totaled million on april in october mt redeemed million of unsecured senior notes due to mature in december that had been assumed in the acquisition of peoples united and included in shortterm borrowings in general the increase in shortterm borrowings reflects the companys liquidity ratio management longterm borrowings averaged billion in the first quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of as of april longterm borrowings assumed in the peoples united acquisition totaled million and included million of fixedrate subordinated notes and million of fhlb advances average balances of the companys outstanding senior notes were billion billion and billion during the three months ended march march and december respectively in january mt issued billion of senior notes that mature in january and pay a fixed rate semiannually until january after which the secured overnight financing rate sofr plus will be paid quarterly until maturity additionally in january mt bank issued billion of senior notes that mature in january and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until maturity

longterm borrowings averaged million in the first quarter of million in the threemonth period ended december and million in the first quarter of junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million million and million during the first quarters of and and the fourth quarter of respectively additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of march interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion exclusive of forwardstarting swap agreements were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter up basis points from in the first quarter of the yield on earning assets during the first quarter of was up basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the fourth quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the increases in the net interest spread since the first quarter of reflect the impact of generally rising interest rates that resulted in higher yields on loans and leases deposits at the frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates on interestbearing liabilities the federal reserve raised its target federal funds rate since march including various increases totaling and in the first quarter of and fourth quarter of respectively the decline in the net interest spread in the recent quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of reflected higher levels of average time deposits reflecting customer demand and borrowings and the impact of competitive pricing and rising rates associated with interestbearing instruments net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the first three months of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of the increases in average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter and the fourth quarter of as compared with first quarter of reflect higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits and shareholders equity that include the impact of the acquisition of peoples united in connection with the peoples united acquisition the company added noninterestbearing deposits of billion at the acquisition date noninterestbearing deposits averaged billion in the first quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of compared with billion in the first quarter of the increase in noninterestbearing deposits resulting from the acquisition of peoples united was partially offset by the impact of seasonal decreases customer use of offbalance sheet investment products and a shift in deposits to interestbearing accounts as interest rates rose shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended march compared with billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the fourth quarter of the higher amounts of shareholders equity in the two most recent quarters as compared with 2022s first quarter reflect retained earnings and additional equity issued in connection with the peoples united acquisition partially offset by share repurchase activity mt issued billion of common equity and million of preferred equity in completing the acquisition of peoples united on april repurchases of common stock totaled approximately million in the first quarter of and billion in the last three quarters of there were no common stock repurchases in the first quarter of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in both the first quarter of and fourth quarter of and billion in the yearearlier quarter the company recorded billion of goodwill on april which represents excess consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in the peoples united transaction as part of the transaction intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value thereby increasing the balance of core deposit and other intangible assets on the companys balance sheet by million on april the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter the increase since march is predominantly reflective of the impact of the peoples united acquisition other changes in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with and in the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of respectively the increased contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the recent quarter and fourth quarter of as compared with the initial quarter reflects higher rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads could impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin the federal open market committee has conducted a series of basis point increases in shortterm interest rates since march totaling those actions have led to generally higher interest rates overall and accordingly have contributed to the companys higher net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter the recent quarters net interest margin decreased modestly from in the fourth quarter of that decrease reflects a basis point compression of the net interest spread largely offset by a basis point increase in the contribution of interestfree funds management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at march interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at march and billion at december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at march billion at march and billion at december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company enters into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended march march and december were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the valuation of cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in

effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever cash flows associated with financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the frb of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at march and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively and shortterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively the company has benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at march billion at december and billion at march brokered time deposits totaled billion and billion at march and december respectively brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding at march the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was million at march the majority of those securities were remarketed in april there were no such securities in the trading account at december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at march million at december and million at march mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at march approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings as previously described in january mt issued billion of senior notes that mature in january outstanding senior notes of mt at march and december were billion and billion respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at march and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and regulatory expectations and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business available liquidity at march included cash on deposit at the frb of new york of billion unused lines of credit of billion and unencumbered investment securities after estimated haircut of approximately billion management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at march the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of executive management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates march december in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes mix and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve changes in amounts presented since december reflect changes in portfolio composition including shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and higher levels of borrowings the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company amidst the rising rate environment since the first quarter of mts deposit pricing beta that is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates averaged between to percent the deposit pricing beta is assumed to be approximately to percent in the scenarios presented the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes a significant amount of the companys earning assets interestbearing liabilities preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements have contractual repricing terms that reference the london interbank offered rate libor publication of certain tenors of libor has already ceased and complete cessation of libor publication is expected by june effective december the company essentially discontinued entering into new liborbased contracts the companys enterprisewide libor transition program is monitored by executive management as well as the risk committee of the board of directors at march the company had liborbased commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans of billion and residential mortgage and consumer loans of billion outstanding approximately

junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at march approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at march december and march included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists events posing emerging risks to the macroeconomic environment such as international conflicts and other events liquidity concerns inflation and supply chain issues are considered when developing economic forecasts even if the events do not directly and materially impact the companys financial results supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures liquidity trends or other peripheral impacts of global events may alter economic forecasts and the company monitors this activity as part of its risk management procedures in assessing the allowance for credit losses among the assumptions utilized as of march was that the national unemployment rate will average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively contract and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized as of december included an average national unemployment rate of through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable period at a average annual rate followed by a average rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of march was that the national unemployment rate would average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the assumptions utilized were based on the information available to the company at or near march december and march at the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages in the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at march appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at march compared with billion at march and billion at december as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at march at march and at december using the same methodology described herein the company added million to the allowance for credit losses related to the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april macroeconomic assumptions used to estimate credit losses on loans acquired from peoples united were consistent with those used by the company to estimate credit losses at march the combined company allowance for credit losses at april as a percentage of loans outstanding was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at march march and december was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses other income other income totaled million in the first quarter of up from
