item ris k factors table end mt and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the companys business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations as well as on the values of the companys financial instruments and mts common stock the company has developed a risk management process to identify understand mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the company market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have adverse effects on the companys business including table start a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company table end table start a decrease in net interest income derived from the companys lending and deposit gathering activities table end table start a decrease in the value of the companys investment securities loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate table end table start otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities in the companys investment securities portfolio or other investments table end table start a decrease in fees from the companys brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices table end table start potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels table end table start an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill table end table start an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale table end the companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates the monetary tax and other policies of governmental agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately as a result of the high percentage of the companys assets and liabilities that are in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on the companys business and profitability and the value of the companys assets and liabilities for example changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may table start affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the table end table start interest that the company pays on liabilities which impacts the companys overall net interest income and profitability table end table start adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments which in turn affects the companys loss rates on those assets table end table start decrease the demand for interest ratebased products and services including loans and deposits table end table start affect the companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges table end table start affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues potentially adversely affecting the companys results of operations table end the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the company an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interestbearing deposits and can also affect the value of the companys onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet financial instruments also due to the impact on rates for shortterm funding the federal reserves policies influence to a significant extent the companys cost of such funding in addition the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record taxrelated assets or liabilities have been appropriate should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the companys results of operations mt cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the companys business activities financial condition and results of operations the forecasted discontinuation of libor and the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace libor could adversely impact the companys business and results of operations the companys floatingrate funding certain hedging transactions and certain of the companys products such as floatingrate loans and mortgages determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate libor or to an index currency basket or other financial metric libor and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july the chief executive of the financial conduct authority fca announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after consequently at this time it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor such that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after similarly it is not possible to predict whether and for how long libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the markets for liborlinked financial instruments regulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees eg the federal reservesponsored alternative reference rates committee to among other things facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace libor and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from libor including i the utilization of recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments and ii development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybased repurchase transactions at this time it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments the discontinuation of libor or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of libor as a benchmark could result in changes to the companys risk exposures for example if the anticipated discontinuation of libor adversely affects the availability or cost of floatingrate funding and therefore the companys exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the company has issued or owns a substantial portion of the companys on and offbalance sheet financial instruments many of which have terms that extend beyond are indexed to libor including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes loans to commercial customers and consumers including mortgage loans and other loans and longterm borrowings in addition such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements loss of market share in certain products adverse tax or accounting impacts and compliance legal and operational costs and risks the company established an enterprisewide libor transition program in an impact assessment has been completed to identify on and offbalance sheet exposures systems processes models customers and employees affected by the discontinuation of libor the company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products associated with libor to alternative reference rates the companys business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets as most of the companys assets and liabilities are financial in nature the companys performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets turmoil and volatility in us and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions leading to some of the risks discussed herein including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company financial market volatility may table start affect the value or liquidity of the companys onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet financial instruments table end table start affect the value of capitalized servicing assets table end table start affect mts ability to access capital markets to raise funds inability to access capital markets if needed at cost effective rates could adversely affect the companys liquidity and results of operations table end table start affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the companys services table end table start impact the nature profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages table end volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets in addition unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel which can result in market volatility negatively impact client activity and adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations the companys regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint the companys core banking business is largely concentrated within the companys retail banking office network footprint located principally in new york maryland new jersey pennsylvania delaware connecticut virginia west virginia and the district of columbia therefore the company is or in the future may be particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and midatlantic regions risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole not stockholders these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the companys lending practices capital structure amounts of capital investment practices dividend policy growth and expansionary activity among other things failure to comply with laws regulations policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties the loss of fdic insurance the revocation of a banking charter other sanctions by regulatory agencies andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations in this regard government authorities including the bank regulatory agencies can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the companys ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time in addition enforcement matters could impact the companys supervisory and cra ratings which may in turn restrict or limit the companys activities any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the companys businesses result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses additionally such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the company deals in the ordinary course of business such as rating agencies insurance companies and investors heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways and in turn could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized and the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain for more information on the regulations to which the company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see part i item business in this report mt may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements bank holding companies including mt are subject to capital and liquidity standards imposed as a result of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa and the us basel iiibased capital rules for additional information see capital requirements under part i item business from time to time regulators may implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements if the company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements its business activities including lending and its ability to expand either organically or through acquisitions could be limited it could also result in mt being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders or sell or refrain from acquiring assets in addition the liquidityrelated provisions of the federal reserves liquidityrelated enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the companys ability to invest in other longerterm assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective egrrcpa the tailoring rules and other recent rulemaking have in some cases reduced the capital or liquidity requirements applicable to mt eg the company is no longer subject to any lcr requirement and the same is expected to be true for any finalized nsfr however basel iv significantly revises the basel capital framework and the impact on the company will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the us with respect to firms such as mt mts ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend in part on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve any decision by mt to return capital to shareholders whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program requires the approval of mts board of directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval including through the federal reserves ccar process and the supervisory stress tests required under the doddfrank act whereby mts financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions prior to the public disclosure of a bhcs ccar results the federal reserve will provide the bhc with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a onetime opportunity for the bhc to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan the federal reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bhcs regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions if any would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a ninequarter period under severely adverse stress conditions if the federal reserve objects to mts capital plan it could impose restrictions on mts ability to return capital to shareholders including through paying dividends entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of mt mt cannot be certain that the federal reserve will not object to future capital plans in addition federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bhcs ability to make quarterly capital distributions dividends and common stock share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a nonobjection from the federal reserve as such mts ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock as well as the amount of such dividends will depend in part on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of mts control if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or nonbank financial company were triggered mt could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund olf the doddfrank act created a mechanism the olf for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies the olf is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdics bank resolution model the secretary of the us treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the president of the us and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a twothirds vote liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf which will borrow from the us treasury and impose riskbased assessments on covered financial companies riskbased assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on among others bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt any such assessments may adversely affect the companys business financial condition or results of operations credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company as a lender the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios factors that can influence the companys credit loss experience include i the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate ii the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the companys loan portfolio iii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country iv the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate and v the size of the companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers which historically have experienced higher net chargeoffs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents in managements judgment the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio the allowance is determined by managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the current financial condition of specific borrowers the economic environment in which borrowers operate the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of december appropriately reflects incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio however there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover such credit losses the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition the companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities as well as meet regulatory expectations the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business core customer deposits which include noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds in addition to customer deposits sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks securities dealers various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york the companys liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms negative news about the company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the company which could in turn materially adversely affect the companys liquidity and funding such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets and downgrades in one or more of the companys credit ratings and may also negatively affect the companys ability to access the capital markets a downgrade in the companys credit ratings which could result from general industrywide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company could adversely affect the companys ability to borrow funds including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect mts ability to raise capital many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which mt has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively the companys liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected mt relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity mt is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries mt typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends these dividends are mts principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock pay interest and principal on its debt and fund purchases of its common stock various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that mts banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as parent bank holding companies see item business distributions for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations also mts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors limitations on mts ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt and ability to fund purchases of its common stock strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the companys revenue and profitability the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts but also with insurance companies mutual funds hedge funds securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the us globally and over the internet some of the companys nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company is and may have greater flexibility in competing for business in particular the activity and prominence of socalled marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing the company competes on the basis of several factors including capital access to capital revenue generation products services transaction execution innovation reputation and price over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms these developments could result in the companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits finally technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services financial technology providers who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology in particular digital and mobile technology are beginning to offer more traditional banking products either directly or through bank partnerships and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a banklike charter such as the occs fintech charter as a result the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network further along with other participants in the financial services industry the company frequently attempts to introduce new technologydriven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs the company may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the companys own operations may prevent mt from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions mt has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations including table start inability to fully achieve the companys strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition table end table start issues arising during transition and integration table end table start disruption of the companys business and diversion of managements time and attention table end table start exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions table end table start loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions table end table start dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of mt common stock table end table start payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the companys tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and longterm table end table start inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity for example the company could experience higher credit losses incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity table end table start changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities table end operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the companys business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure like all businesses the company is subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the companys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated no system of controls however well designed and maintained is infallible control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges increased operational costs harm to the companys reputation or foregone business opportunities mt could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel mts success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the company engages and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them growth in the companys business including through acquisitions may increase its need for additional qualified personnel the company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the company does if the company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business financial condition and results of operations the companys compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve the occ the fdic and other regulators the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization in addition the doddfrank act required those agencies along with the sec to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant the companys performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected the companys information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security the company relies heavily on communications and information systems including those of thirdparty service providers to conduct its business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting deposit loan and other systems and adversely affect the companys customer relationships while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if any does occur that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated information security risks for large financial institutions such as mt have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties including through cyber attacks to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions there have been several instances involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data including by executive impersonation and third party vendors there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information as cyber threats continue to evolve the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internetbased applications expands further third parties with which the company does business as well as vendors and other third parties with which the companys customers do business can also be sources of information security risk to the company particularly where activities of customers are beyond the companys security and control systems such as through the use of the internet personal computers tablets smart phones and other mobile services security breaches affecting the companys customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties may require the company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the company or its customers thereby increasing the companys operational costs and adversely affecting its business the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of the companys systems or those of thirdparty service providers or in turn providers to such thirdparty providers particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers could damage the companys reputation result in a loss of customer business subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability the company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the cybersecurity regulation of the nysdfs are implemented the time and resources needed for the company to comply with such laws and regulations as well as its potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase in addition the company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy surveillance encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make the company more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations mt relies on other companies to provide key components of the companys business infrastructure third parties provide key components of the companys business infrastructure such as banking services processing and internet connections and network access any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions failures in the companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business additionally the company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our thirdparty service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the company notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties the company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors use of common service providers the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits legal proceedings informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences many aspects of the companys business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability mt andor its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities and in some cases from the activities of companies mt has acquired in addition from time to time mt is or may become the subject of governmental and selfregulatory agency informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry including by bank and other regulatory agencies the sec and law enforcement authorities the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation mt is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties damages adverse judgments settlements fines injunctions restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business or reputational harm although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question thus the companys ultimate losses may be higher and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies which could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations business risk changes in accounting standards could impact the companys financial condition and results of operations the accounting standard setters including the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations for example accounting standards update measurement of credit losses on financial instruments became effective january and substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets the adoption of the standard has resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately million in some cases the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which would result in the restating of the companys prior period financial statements information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note of notes to financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k the companys reported financial condition and results of operations depend on managements selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the companys reported financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results several of mts accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the companys financial statements if assumptions or estimates underlying the companys financial statements are incorrect the company may experience material losses management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets liabilities commitments and contingencies a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income recognizing an expense recovering an asset valuing an asset or liability or recognizing or reducing a liability mt has established detailed policies and control procedures that are
