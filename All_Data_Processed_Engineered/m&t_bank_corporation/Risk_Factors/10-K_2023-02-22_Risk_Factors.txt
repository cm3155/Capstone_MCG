factors mt and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the companys business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the companys business financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as on the values of the companys financial instruments and mts securities including its common stock the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the company risks related to the acquisition of peoples united mt may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of peoples united and integrating peoples united may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected in connection with the acquisition of peoples united that was completed on april mt has incurred and may further incur costs as mt continues to integrate the peoples united business the success of the acquisition depends in part on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of mt and peoples united to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the acquisition mt must integrate and combine peoples uniteds businesses in a manner that permits cost savings to be realized without adversely affecting revenues and future growth if mt is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings of the acquisition could be less than anticipated there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the acquisition will be realized to offset the transaction and integration costs over time mt may also incur additional costs to retain legacy peoples united customers maintain employee morale and to retain key employees mt has waived certain fees following conversion of customer deposit accounts to mts deposit servicing system and similar or other costs related to integration of peoples united or operations as a combined company may be incurred in the future it is possible that challenges related to operating as a combined company could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect mts abilities to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have an adverse effect upon the revenues levels of expenses and operating results of mt which may adversely affect the value of mts common stock mt may be unable to retain personnel successfully the success of the acquisition will depend in part on the companys ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees it is possible that these employees including key legacy peoples united employees may decide not to remain with the company if the company is unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to the successful future operations of the combined company the company could face disruptions in its operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs if key employees terminate their employment the companys business activities may be adversely affected and the company may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements litigation related to the acquisition has been filed in the past and additional litigation may be filed in the future which could result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of the company although not currently active litigation related to the acquisition was filed against peoples united the peoples united board of directors and mt prior to the completion of the acquisition additional litigation may be filed against mt and the mt board of directors in the future among other remedies litigation that was filed sought damages and additional litigation by shareholders of mt in the future may seek damages or other remedies the outcome of any litigation is uncertain such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of mt market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have adverse effects on the companys business including a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company a decrease in net interest income derived from the companys lending and deposit gathering activities a decrease in the value of the companys investment securities loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate a decrease in fees from the companys brokerage trust and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs provision for credit losses as well as impairment writedowns of certain investment securities and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale if recessionary economic conditions develop they would likely have a negative financial impact across the financial services industry including on the company if recessionary economic conditions are more severe the extent of the negative impact on the companys business and financial performance can increase and be more severe including the adverse effects listed above and discussed throughout this risk factors section supply chain constraints robust demand and labor shortages have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein for example higher inflation or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation could reduce demand for the companys products adversely affect the creditworthiness of the companys borrowers result in lower values for the companys investment securities and other interestearning assets and increase expense related to talent acquisition and retention additionally economic conditions financial markets and inflationary pressures may be adversely affected by the impact of current or anticipated geopolitical uncertainties military conflicts including russias invasion of ukraine pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and global national and local responses thereto by governmental authorities and other third parties these unpredictable events could create increase or prolong economic and financial disruptions and volatility that adversely affects the companys business financial condition capital and results of operations the companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates the monetary tax and other policies of governmental agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately the federal reserve raised benchmark interest rates throughout and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions particularly inflationary pressures as a result of the high percentage of the companys assets and liabilities that are in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates including in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates as well as changes linked to inflation can have a material effect on the companys business and profitability and the value of the companys assets and liabilities for example changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities which impacts the companys overall net interest income and profitability adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustablerate loans and other debt instruments which in turn affects the companys loss rates on those assets decrease the demand for interest ratebased products and services including loans and deposits affect the companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges affect mortgage prepayment speeds and result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues potentially adversely affecting the companys results of operations the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the company an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interestbearing deposits and can also affect the value of the companys onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet financial instruments interest rate increases have recently reduced the value of the companys investment portfolio for example by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities furthermore as interest rates rise the companys unrealized gains on fixed income securities would ordinarily decrease and unrealized losses would ordinarily increase which occurred in and could continue to occur in also due to the impact on rates for shortterm funding the federal reserves policies influence to a significant extent the companys cost of such funding and increases in shortterm interest rates have in the past increased and may in the future increase the companys cost of shortterm funding in addition the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record taxrelated assets or liabilities have been appropriate should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the companys results of operations mt cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the companys business activities financial condition and results of operations the discontinuation of libor as a permissible rate index in new contracts the formal announcement of libors cessation date and the development of sofr and other alternative benchmark indices to replace libor could adversely impact the companys business and results of operations the companys floatingrate funding certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the companys products such as floatingrate loans and mortgages determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate libor or to an alternative index with respect to libor the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor and the ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of libor have announced that the publication of all tenors of usd libor which to date have been calculated and determined by the iba based on the required submissions by independent panel banks will cease to exist andor cease to be representative after june in response and in coordination us federal bank regulators including the federal reserve required us banks to cease using usd libor as a reference rate in new contracts by december concurrently the federal reservesponsored alternative reference rates committee arrc finalized and issued recommendations for the use of socalled hardwired libor fallback language that when incorporated into existing liborbased loan documents provides for upon libors permanent cessation or an announcement from libors administrator or certain governmental authorities that libor is no longer representative of the underlying market the replacement of libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the benchmark index with an appropriate spread adjustment that is representative of the historical difference between libor and sofr which when added to sofr would be intended to facilitate a valueneutral transition subsequently the arrc expanded its recommendation to include cme term sofr a derivative of sofr that is currently administered and published by the cme group benchmark administration limited in mt adopted hardwired fallback language modeled after the arrc recommendations for use in all new commercial libor loans and continues to proactively seek amendments to its existing liborbased commercial loan contracts to incorporate such hardwired fallback language or move to an alternative index prior to the cessation of libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybased repurchase transactions the fact that sofr is a secured overnight rate and considered a risk free rate while libor is an unsecured term rate that factors in credit risk means that sofr may perform differently than libor and those differences may be material particularly in times of economic stress negatively impacting the companys profitability while the arrc has maintained its recommendation that sofr is the preferred replacement for libor some industry participants have questioned whether a risk free sofrbased rate is an ideal replacement for libor in the commercial lending market and suggesting that a creditsensitive component or alternative be considered and developed one such credit sensitive alternative is the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsby which gained some modest attention and use in the commercial lending market in the latter half of primarily in syndicated loans but has since gained little traction whether bsby or other alternatives to sofr develop and gain any significant market traction in the future are unknown and unpredictable at this time and this adds further market uncertainty with respect to introducing alternative benchmark rates for new contracts libor cessation is also impacting the derivatives market in october the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda published the ibor fallbacks supplement supplement and ibor fallbacks protocol protocol the supplement which became effective on january amends existing standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks to the sofr benchmark for derivatives linked to libor the protocol enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy noncleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol the fallbacks apply following a permanent cessation of libor or following a determination by the fca that libor is no longer representative of the underlying market mt and mt bank adhered to the protocol on november and the company is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap hedging transactions with certain of its end user customers ie borrowers that have hedged their interest rate payment obligations who have not already adhered to or amended their legacy derivatives transactions consistent with the protocol if the company is not able to agree to appropriate libor fallbacks with these customers there will be uncertainty as to how to value and determine the companys rights and obligations under legacy derivatives contracts with respect to the companys cleared interest rate derivatives that reference libor both the cme and lch clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant sofr benchmark fallbacks of the supplement and protocol which also became effective on january the company has outstanding issuances or acts as an administrative or calculation agent or in other capacities across various maturities of securities referencing libor in which the underlying contracts do not contemplate cessation or contemplate cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks tough legacy contracts some of these contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges or that gives the company or another party discretion to select a rate or provide for determination of a reference rate in march the united states congress enacted the adjustable interest rate libor act libor act which provides both a statutory framework to replace usd libor with a benchmark rate based on sofr for tough legacy contracts governed by us law and a safe harbor provision for those entities selecting a sofrbased rate identified by the federal reserve under the libor act the federal reserve must adopt rules to among other things identify the applicable sofrbased replacement rate in december the federal reserve adopted rules which identify different sofrbased replacement rates for derivative contracts for cash instruments such as floatingrate notes and preferred stock for consumer loans for certain governmentsponsored enterprise contracts and for certain assetbacked securities notwithstanding this availability of statutory frameworks to address tough legacy contracts there will likely be continued uncertainty surrounding the transition as these frameworks have not been tested and the finalized regulations from the federal reserve have not been issued and their effectiveness and ultimate impact is not certain a substantial portion of the companys on and offbalance sheet financial instruments many of which have terms that extend beyond are indexed to libor including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and nonhedging purposes loans to commercial customers and consumers including mortgage loans and other loans and longterm borrowings uncertainty as to the impact of the discontinuation of libor and the replacement of libor with a sofrbased index or any alternative index could result in pricing volatility loss of market share in certain products adverse tax or accounting impacts under certain circumstances and compliance legal and operational costs and risks the markets transition from libor to an alternative reference rate will be complex and unpredictable giving rise to a variety of risks including operational risks risks of value transfer between contract parties the potential for customer disputes and litigation as well as regulatory scrutiny the companys business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets as most of the companys assets and liabilities are financial in nature the companys performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets turmoil and volatility in us and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions leading to some of the risks discussed herein including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company financial market volatility may affect the value or liquidity of the companys onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet financial instruments affect the value of capitalized servicing assets affect mts ability to access capital markets to raise funds inability to access capital markets if needed at cost effective rates could adversely affect the companys liquidity and results of operations affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the companys services impact the nature profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets in addition unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by supply chain disruptions the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel as well as elevated inflation which can result in market volatility negatively impact client activity and adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations the companys regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint the companys core banking business is largely concentrated within the companys retail banking office network footprint located principally in the northeast and midatlantic regions therefore the company is or in the future may be particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and midatlantic regions the credit quality of the companys borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the companys control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the northeast and midatlantic regions have caused and in the future may cause the company to experience impairment charges which are reductions in the recoverable value of an asset increased purchase demands wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice higher costs eg servicing foreclosure property maintenance additional writedowns and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers depositors and the financial system as a whole not securities holders including the holders of common stock these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the companys sale and lending practices capital structure capital distributions and dividend policy investment practices growth and expansionary activity among other things failure to comply with laws regulations or policies or to meet supervisory expectations could result in civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties the loss of fdic insurance the revocation of a banking charter other sanctions by regulatory agencies andor reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations in this regard government authorities including the bank regulatory agencies can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the companys ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing as part of such settlements which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time in addition enforcement matters could impact the companys supervisory and cra ratings which may in turn restrict or limit the companys activities a prior enforcement action also increases the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action any new regulatory requirements changes to existing requirements or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the companys businesses result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses additionally such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the company deals in the ordinary course of business such as rating agencies insurance companies and investors heightened regulatory scrutiny requirements or expectations could have significant effects on the company including through restrictions on growth or required remediation activities and associated resource requirements and in turn could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the company that have been enacted or proposed in recent years and additional proposed changes are anticipated many of these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized and the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain for more information on the regulations to which the company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see part i item business the company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements bank holding companies including mt are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa and the us basel iiibased capital rules for additional information see capital requirements under part i item business regulators have implemented and may from time to time implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements if the company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory requirements its business activities including lending and its ability to expand either organically or through acquisitions could be limited it could also result in mt being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders or sell or refrain from acquiring assets in addition the liquidityrelated provisions of the federal reserves liquidityrelated enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the companys ability to invest in other longerterm assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective which could adversely affect its net interest income and net interest margin the federal bank regulators have not yet released a proposal to implement the significant revisions of the basel capital framework announced by the basel committee in december and the impact on the company of these revisions will depend on the manner in which they are implemented in the us with respect to firms such as mt mts ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend in part on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the federal reserve any decision by mt to return capital to shareholders whether through a common stock dividend or a common stock share repurchase program requires the approval of mts board of directors and must comply with applicable capital regulations including the maintenance of capital ratios exceeding specified minimum levels and applicable buffers for bank holding companies designated as category iv institutions under the tailoring rules including mt the federal reserve conducts biennial supervisory stress tests required under the doddfrank act whereby the bhcs financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions the results of those stress tests are incorporated in the determination of mts stress capital buffer as a general matter if mt is unable to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels inclusive of its stress capital buffer it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing stock in june the federal reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests and based on those results on october mts stress capital buffer of became effective the results of future supervisory stress tests are uncertain and a more severe outcome may result in a higher stress capital buffer and an increase in mts effective capital requirements an increased stress capital buffer may restrict mts ability to return capital to shareholders including through paying dividends entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of mt the federal reserve has in the past implemented and may in the future implement restrictions on share repurchase programs and common stock dividends at large bank holding companies such as mt including in response to adverse or uncertain economic conditions if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or nonbank financial company were triggered mt could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund olf the doddfrank act created a mechanism the olf for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies the olf is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdics bank resolution model the secretary of the us treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the president of the us and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a twothirds vote liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf which will borrow from the us treasury and impose riskbased assessments on covered financial companies riskbased assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on among others bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt any such assessments may adversely affect the companys business financial condition or results of operations credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company as a lender the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios factors that can influence the companys credit loss experience include i the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate ii the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the companys loan portfolio including in the new york city area iii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country iv the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate and v the size of the companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers which historically have experienced higher net chargeoffs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers the companys credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry geography or asset type as described further in this risk factors section the companys credit risks may be increased by the impacts of inflation poor or recessionary economic conditions and financial market volatility the covid19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect customers commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to workfromhome or hybridwork arrangements changing consumer preferences including for online shopping covid19related restrictions and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers as described above the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents in managements judgment the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio the allowance is determined by managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the current financial condition of specific borrowers the economic environment in which borrowers operate the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of december appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio however there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition the companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the company any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities as well as meet regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business core customer deposits which include noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds in addition to customer deposits sources of liquidity include borrowings from securities dealers various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york as well as the debt and equity capital markets the companys liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms negative news about the company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the company which could in turn materially adversely affect the companys liquidity and funding such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets and downgrades in one or more of the companys credit ratings and may also negatively affect the companys ability to access the capital markets a downgrade in the companys credit ratings which could result from general industrywide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company could adversely affect the companys ability to borrow funds including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect mts ability to raise capital many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which mt has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the companys results of operations and competitive position various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the company these regulations address among other matters liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements the application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations such as the company have been modified including in connection with the implementation of the tailoring rules in the egrrcpa if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively the companys liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity if the company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits it may be subject to paying higher funding costs the total amount that the company pays for funding costs is dependent in part on the companys ability to maintain or grow its deposits if the company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives it may be subject to paying higher funding costs the company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits recent increases in shortterm interest rates have resulted in and may continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing if competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits the companys funding costs may increase either because the company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding customers may also move noninterestbearing deposits to interest bearing accounts increasing the cost of those deposits checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff the companys bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments causing the company to lose a lower cost source of funding higher funding costs could reduce the companys net interest margin and net interest income mt relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity mt is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries mt typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends these dividends are mts principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock pay interest and principal on its debt and fund purchases of its common stock various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that mts banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as parent bank holding companies see

assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors limitations on mts ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt and ability to fund purchases of its common stock strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the companys revenue and profitability the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts but also with private credit funds insurance companies mutual funds hedge funds securities brokerage firms financial technology companies and other companies offering financial services in the us globally and over the internet some of the companys nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company is and may have greater flexibility in competing for business in particular the activity and prominence of socalled marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing the company competes on the basis of several factors including capital access to capital revenue generation products services transaction execution innovation reputation and price over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms these developments have and could continue to result in the companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity the company has and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share finally technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services financial technology providers who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology in particular digital and mobile technology are beginning to offer more traditional banking products either directly or through bank partnerships and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a banklike charter such as the occs fintech charter in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain as well as advances in robotic process automation could significantly affect the competition for financial services as a result the company has had and will likely continue to have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network further along with other participants in the financial services industry the company frequently attempts to introduce new technologydriven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs the company may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the companys own operations may prevent mt from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions mt has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future the companys ability to complete acquisitions is in many instances subject to regulatory approval and the company cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals would be granted any requisite approval could be delayed or not obtained at all including due to among other factors an adverse development in either partys regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval including factors not known at the time of entering into the definitive agreement for the acquisition or submission of the related application for regulatory approval and factors that may arise subsequently governmental political or community group inquiries investigations or opposition or changes in legislation or the political environment more generally in addition inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations including inability to fully achieve the companys strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition issues arising during transition and integration disruption of the companys business and diversion of managements time and attention exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of mt common stock payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the companys tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and longterm inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity for example the company could experience higher credit losses incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities mt could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel mts success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the company engages and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them growth in the companys business including through acquisitions may increase its need for additional qualified personnel the company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the company does recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace which may increase costs and adversely impact the company the increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements and opportunities in regional national and global labor markets has also increased competition for the company to attract and retain skilled personnel the companys current or future approach to inoffice and remotework arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared with the arrangements offered by other companies which could adversely affect the companys ability to attract and retain employees if the company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled qualified and diverse individuals it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business financial condition and results of operations the companys compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve the occ the fdic and other regulators the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization in addition the doddfrank act required those agencies along with the sec to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant the companys performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the companys business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure like all businesses the company is subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the company and breaches in data security operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the companys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated no system of controls however well designed and maintained is infallible control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges increased operational costs harm to the companys reputation or foregone business opportunities the companys information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security including due to events beyond the companys control the company relies heavily on communications and information systems including those of thirdparty service providers to conduct its business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting deposit loan and other systems and adversely affect the companys customer relationships disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the companys control may include computer viruses electrical or telecommunications outages quality of vulnerability patches cyber security attacks including distributed denial of service attacks which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems devices or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor damage to property or physical assets or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events there can be no assurance that any such failure disruption interruption or security breach will not occur or if any does occur that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated information security risks for large financial institutions such as mt have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties including through cyber security attacks to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions there have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data including by executive impersonation and third party vendors or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to or the usage of operating systems and databases ransomware is a form of malicious software known as malware designed to block access to and often encrypt computer systems or data once the victims computer system or data is locked down and encrypted rendering it essentially useless the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it the attacker may also copy the victims data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data as cyber security threats continue to evolve the company expects to continue to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities the techniques used by cyber security criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internetbased applications expands further third parties with which the company does business as well as vendors and other third parties with which the companys customers do business can also be sources of information security risk to the company particularly where activities of customers are beyond the companys security and control systems such as through the use of the internet personal computers tablets smart phones and other mobile services risks relating to cyber attacks on vendors and other third parties including supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe security breaches affecting the companys customers or systems breakdowns failures security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties may require the company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the company or its customers thereby increasing the companys operational costs and adversely affecting its business additionally successful cyber security attacks at other large financial institutions whether or not the company is impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect mt including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the companys security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the companys financial products though the company has insurance against some cyber security risks and attacks it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event the company as well as third parties with which the company does business has expanded the use of cloud service providers which could experience system breakdowns or failures outages downtime cyber securityattacks negative changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business and reputation for example during there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers thus increasing the amount of infrastructure that the company or its vendors and service providers outsource to the cloud or to other parties may increase mts risk exposure the failure to properly upgrade or maintain the computer systems could result in greater susceptibility to attacks particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse as well as the companys ability to achieve its business continuity and resiliency objectives the company could incur higher costs experience lower revenue and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft loss or misuse of information including due to a cyber security attack like other financial services firms the systems networks and devices of the company its customers employees service providers or other third parties with whom the company interacts continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access denialofservice attacks computer viruses hacking malware ransomware phishing or other forms of social engineering and cyber security attacks designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service eliminate access or cause other damage these threats may arise from human error fraud on the part of employees insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure or vulnerabilities of suppliers through supply chain attacks further cyber security and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of among other things the growth of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including computers smartphones and other mobile devices outside the companys systems by customers to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime fraudsters hackers terrorists activists instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties although the company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls data encryption and tokenization threat intelligence antimalware defenses and vulnerability management tools exist the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner moreover potential new regulations may require the company to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated further as the company expands its mobile and digital capabilities cyber security risks increase a disruption or breach including as a result of a cyber security attack or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the company or at thirdparty service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention remediation costs damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems products and services that could adversely affect the companys business like other us financial services providers the company continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cyber security threats from sophisticated third parties although the company is not aware of any material losses relating to cyber security incidents there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber security incidents will not become known or occur or that the company will not suffer such losses in the future the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability andor reputational damage the company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability andor reputational damage new privacy and data protection initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the company may limit the companys ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data significant examples include the general data protection regulation gdpr the uk gdpr known as the data protection act of and the california consumer privacy act compliance with these and other laws and regulations may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make the company more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations as privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented they may also limit how companies like mt can use personal data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data the time and resources needed for the company to comply with such laws and regulations as well as its potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase the impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions mt relies on other companies to provide key components of the companys business infrastructure third parties provide key components of the companys business infrastructure such as banking services processing and internet connections and network access any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions failures in the companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business additionally the company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to the companys thirdparty service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the company notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties the company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors use of common service providers the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits legal proceedings informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences many aspects of the companys business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability mt andor its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities and in some cases from the activities of companies mt has acquired in addition from time to time mt is or may become the subject of governmental and selfregulatory agency informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry including by bank and other regulatory agencies the sec and law enforcement authorities the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation mt is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties damages adverse judgments settlements fines injunctions restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business or reputational harm although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question thus the companys ultimate losses may be higher and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies which could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations business risk changes in accounting standards could impact the companys reported financial condition and results of operations the accounting standard setters including the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which would result in the restating of the companys prior period financial statements information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note of notes to financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k the companys reported financial condition and results of operations depend on managements selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the companys reported financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results several of mts accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the companys financial statements if assumptions or estimates underlying the companys financial statements are incorrect the company may experience material losses management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets liabilities commitments and contingencies a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income recognizing an expense recovering an asset valuing an asset or liability or recognizing or reducing a liability mt has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters mt could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect for additional information see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and note significant accounting policies of notes to financial statements in part ii item the companys models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information the company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values among other uses the company uses models throughout many of its business lines relying on them along with its judgement for many decision making processes examples of areas where the company uses models include determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting or estimating losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels the company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future often with respect to macroeconomic conditions in order to generate the output the models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately andor may overstate or understate certain effects poorly designed implemented or managed models or misused models including in the choice of relevant historical data or futurelooking assumptions present the risk that the companys business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information which may damage the companys reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations even if the underlying assumptions used in the companys models are adequate the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design as a result the companys models may not fully capture or express the risks the company faces may suggest that the company has sufficient capital when it may not or may lead the company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates if the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis the company may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that the company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result the company may realize losses or other lapses finally information the company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed implemented or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that the companys regulators make including those related to capital distributions to mts stockholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient the company is exposed to reputational risk a negative public opinion of the company and its business can result from any number of activities including the companys lending practices corporate governance and regulatory compliance acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities significant harm to the companys reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions litigation employee misconduct or the activities of customers other participants in the financial services industry or the companys contractual counterparties such as service providers and vendors a service disruption of the companys technology platforms or an impact to the companys branches could have a negative impact on a customers access to banking services and harm the companys reputation with customers in particular a cyber security event impacting the companys or its customers data could have a negative impact on the companys reputation and customer confidence in the company and its cyber security damage to the companys reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets additionally whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation which magnifies the potential harm to the companys reputation the companys framework for managing risks may not be effective the companys risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the frameworks underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective the company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected the company has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk compliance risk strategic risk reputational risk and operational risk related to its employees systems and vendors among others there are inherent limitations to the companys risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified in addition the company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors including models to monitor measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values which are subject to error the company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees as well as manage risks associated with third parties and could fail to do so effectively if the companys risk management framework proves ineffective the company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations pandemics including covid19 acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the companys business pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts of war military conflicts including russias invasion of ukraine or terrorism and other adverse external events including severe weather and other natural disasters could have a significant impact on the companys ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of the companys deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause the company to incur additional expenses although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company for example the covid19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the companys business financial condition capital and results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will in the future negatively affect the companys business financial condition capital and results of operations will depend on highly uncertain and unpredictable developments including the scope and duration of any surges in the pandemic the emergence of new variants the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures the continued effectiveness of mts business continuity plans the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the companys employees customers clients counterparties vendors service providers and other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic depending on the impact of pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic military conflicts such as russias invasion of ukraine terrorism and other detrimental or destabilizing global and national events on general economic and market conditions consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur including supply chain disruptions higher inflation decreased demand for the companys products and services or those of its borrowers which could increase credit risk challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages talent attrition employee illness willingness to return to work and disruptions to business operations at the company and at counterparties vendors and other service providers even after such events fully subside the us economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession and mt anticipates the companys businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession the escalation or continuation of the war between russia and ukraine or other hostilities could result in among other things further increased risk of cyber attacks supply chain disruptions higher inflation lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity currency and other financial markets to the extent that pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts of war including russias invasion of ukraine or terrorism and other detrimental external events adversely affect the companys business financial condition liquidity capital or results of operations such factors may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section the companys assets communities operations reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk the company operates in regions where its businesses and the activities of its customers could be negatively impacted by climate risk this includes the physical risks resulting from chronic shifts in climate such as rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and acute climate events such as an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters including floods wildfires hurricanes and tornados such chronic shifts and events could damage or otherwise impact the value or productivity of customers assets and disrupt the companys operations and the operations of customers or third parties on which the company relies they could also result in market volatility negatively impact the companys customers ability to repay outstanding loans and damage or deteriorate the value of collateral over time such risks may result in both increasing premiums for and reduced availability of insurance and have a broader impact on the economy further climate risk may manifest from efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy transition risks may arise from changes in consumer and business preferences legislation regulation policy and technological advancement associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change such risks may result in increased expenses or otherwise adversely impact the company and its customers including the ability of customers to repay outstanding loans the company could experience increased expenses resulting from climaterelated strategic planning and market changes as well as litigation and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to its climate change strategy and responses for example the companys reputation may be damaged and its financial condition could suffer as a result of the ineffective identification monitoring or management of risks relating to providing financial services to certain industries or projects that are sensitive to a transition to a lower carbon economy as well as any decisions the company makes to continue to conduct or change its activities in response to considerations relating to climate change ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding appropriate climate risk management practices and disclosures such as the climaterelated disclosure rules proposed by the sec in may also result in higher regulatory compliance and other expenses in addition the expectations of federal and state banking regulators investors and other stakeholders are continuously evolving and may require financial institutions including the company to adhere to increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending investment operations and advisory activities discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10k in part i item business and part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations furthermore in part ii item under the heading forwardlooking statements is included a description of certain risks uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the companys financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of the companys financial instruments in general and mt common stock in particular in addition the market price of mt common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance volatility of stock market prices and volumes rumors or erroneous information changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies
