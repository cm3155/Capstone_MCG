to enhanced prudential standards the enhanced prudential standards include riskbased capital and leverage requirements liquidity standards risk management and risk committee requirements stress test requirements and a debttoequity limit for companies that the financial stability oversight council has determined would pose a grave threat to systemic financial stability were they to fail such limits in october the federal reserve and the other federal bank regulators adopted rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and of capital and liquidity requirements to bank holding companies and depository institutions the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each us bhc with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure and status as a us global systemically important bhc gsib under the tailoring rules mt and pursuant to the tailoring rules its depository institution subsidiaries is subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii under the tailoring rules category iv firms among other things are not subject to any liquidity coverage ratio lcr or in certain cases subject to reduced requirements remain eligible to optout of the requirement to

committee requirements category iv firms continue not to be subject to advanced approaches capital requirements the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer other elements of the tailoring rules are discussed in further detail throughout this section mt will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others permissible activities under the bhc act in general the bhca limits the business of a bhc to banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto in addition bank holding companies are expected to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions including committing resources to support such subsidiaries this support may be required at times when mt may not be inclined or able to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve by regulation or order in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or ii complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the federal reserve activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and merchant banking mt elected to become a financial holding company on march to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed the failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of mt and may also adversely affect the companys ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith as well as loss of financial holding company status additionally if all of the companys depository institution subsidiaries have not received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent examination under the the community reinvestment act of the cra it would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although it would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities see the section captioned community reinvestment act included elsewhere in this discussion distributions mt is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries historically the majority of mts revenue has been from dividends paid to mt by its subsidiary banks mt bank and wilmington trust na are subject to laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay future dividend payments to mt by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank and are subject to the limitations referred to in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies an insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner including any dividend if after making such distribution the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure including the riskbased capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed herein dividend payments by mt to its shareholders and common stock repurchases by mt are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve as described below in this section under stress testing and capital plan review dividends and common stock repurchases net of any new stock issuances as per a capital plan generally may only be paid or made under a capital plan as to which the federal reserve has not objected capital requirements mt and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies the capital rules which are based on the basel committees december final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards referred to as basel iii among other matters the capital rules impose a capital measure called common equity tier capital cet1 to which most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made in addition the capital rules specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain specified requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows table start cet1 to riskweighted assets table end table start tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets table end table start total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and table end table start tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio table end in calculating regulatory capital ratios mt must assign risk weights to the companys assets and offbalance sheet items mt has an ongoing process to review data elements associated with certain assets that from time to time may affect how specific assets are classified and could lead to increases or decreases of the regulatory risk weights assigned to such assets the capital rules also impose a capital conservation buffer ccb of composed entirely of cet1 on top of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress thus the effective minimum ratios applicable to mt are i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the ccb is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income on april the federal reserve issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms capital plans with the ccb requirement details of this proposal are discussed under stress testing and capital plan review herein although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios cet1 consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the capital rules including common stock and related surplus net of treasury stock retained earnings certain minority interests and for certain firms aoci as permitted under the capital rules mt made a onetime permanent election to neutralize certain aoci components with the result that those components are not recognized in mts cet1 the capital rules also preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital thus trust preferred securities no longer included in mts tier capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier capital on a permanent basis and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of tier capital set forth in the capital rules mts regulatory capital ratios are presented in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 capital generally became fully phasedin on january except that in november the federal banking regulators revised the capital rules to extend the thencurrent transitional treatment of these deductions for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations the transition rule until revisions to the deductions became effective in july the federal banking regulators adopted rules intended to simplify the deductions for these items for banking organizations such as mt that are not subject to the advanced approaches under the capital rules the capital simplification rules the capital simplifications rules and the rescission of the transition rule were adopted by the company as of january in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the company the impact of basel iv will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal banking regulators stress testing and capital plan review as part of the enhanced prudential requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions the federal reserve conducts periodic analyses of bank holding companies with at least billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the companies have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios generated by the federal reserve for category iv firms such as mt these supervisory stress tests occur on a biennial basis including the federal reserve may also use additional components in the severely adverse scenario or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific business groups a summary of results of the federal reserves analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario is publicly disclosed under the tailoring rules category iv firms including mt are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements however they remain subject to the quantitative review of their capital plans under ccar to required capital plan submissions and to the associated reporting requirements in addition bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt must submit annual capital plans for approval as part of the federal reserves ccar process covered bank holding companies may execute capital actions such as paying dividends and repurchasing stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the federal reserve or any approved amendments to such plan the comprehensive capital plans include a view of capital adequacy under various scenarios including a bhcdefined baseline scenario a baseline scenario provided by the federal reserve at least one bhcdefined stress scenario and severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal reserve the ccar process is intended to help ensure that these bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress each of the bank holding companies participating in the ccar process is also required to collect and report certain related data to the federal reserve on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve to monitor progress against the approved capital plans each capital plan must include a view of capital adequacy under the stress test scenarios described above in connection with the adoption of the tailoring rules the federal reserve stated that it expects to revise its guidance relating to capital planning to align with the categories of standards set forth in the tailoring rules and the impact of the future proposal on mt and its capital planning process will depend on the final form of the federal reserves revised guidance the federal reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bhc will maintain sufficient regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan the rules also provide that a covered bhc may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios the federal reserve also incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firms capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning mts annual ccar capital plan is currently due in april each year the federal reserve publishes the results of its supervisory stress tests and quantitative ccar review of capital plans by june of each year in addition to other limitations mts ability to make any capital distributions is contingent on the federal reserves nonobjection to mts capital plan the federal reserve generally limits a bhcs ability to make quarterly capital distributions that is dividends and share repurchases if the amount of the bhcs actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a nonobjection from the federal reserve as noted above on april the federal reserve issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement if adopted the proposal would replace the current static ccb with a stress capital buffer scb requirement the scb subject to a minimum of would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer slb requirement similar to the scb which would apply to the tier leverage ratio in addition the proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but would require a bhc to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bhcs own baseline scenario projections the federal reserve has stated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to a category iv bhc to align with the twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bank holding companies liquidity the federal reserve and other banking regulators have adopted rules implementing a us version of the basel committees lcr requirement which is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of socalled high quality liquid assets hqla to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including mt are no longer subject to any lcr requirement the basel iii framework also included a second standard referred to as the net stable funding ratio nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations although the nsfr has not been finalized it is expected that the framework for applying any finalized nsfr will be consistent with the approach for the lcr requirement under the tailoring rules under the tailoring rules category iv firms including mt remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements but these requirements are now tailored such that these firms are required to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures these firms are now also subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on the fr on a monthly basis mt remains subject to the liquidity buffer requirements cross guaranty provision the cross guaranty provisions in the federal deposit insurance act fdia were enacted by congress in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea and require each insured depository institution owned by the same bhc to be financially responsible for the failure or resolution costs of any affiliated insured institution generally the amount of the cross guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the dif for the resolution of the affiliated institutions in default the fdics claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its bhc and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution the fdic may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the dif volcker rule on december the federal banking regulators and the sec adopted the socalled volcker rule to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act limiting proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds defined as covered funds in the volcker rule the company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the volcker rule and implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur the covered funds limits are imposed through a conformance period that ended in july the company has sought and received from the federal reserve a fiveyear extension to july to either divest or terminate its investment in one venture capital fund in october the federal reserve occ fdic cftc and sec finalized rules to tailor the application of the volcker rule based on the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions requirements and exemptions these regulators have also stated their intention to engage in further rulemaking with respect to the implementing of regulations relating to covered funds including potential changes to the definition of covered funds and the prohibitions on certain covered transactions safety and soundness standards guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the fdia establish general standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits in general these guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines additionally the agencies adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties limits on undercapitalized depository institutions the fdia establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions referred to as the prompt corrective action the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed the fdic has specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the federal reserves regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define well capitalized a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least ii a tier capital ratio of at least iii a total capital ratio of at least and iv a tier leverage ratio of at least an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than prevailing market rates making acquisitions establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the fdic institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which mt and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from mt bank and wilmington trust na in general sections and of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w require that any covered transaction by mt bank and wilmington trust na or any of their respective subsidiaries with an affiliate must in certain cases be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited as follows a in the case of any single such affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution and b in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions of an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution covered transactions are defined by statute to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve from the affiliate certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on market terms fdic insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments mt bank and wilmington trust na deposits are insured by the dif of the fdic up to the limits set forth under applicable law the fdic imposes a riskbased premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for financial institutions deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity for larger institutions such as mt bank the fdic uses a performance score and a lossseverity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic uses a banks capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic acquisitions the bhca requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings institution if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings institution or it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc financial holding companies are required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion the bhca further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the cra and compliance with consumer protection laws the federal reserve must take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering in addition pursuant to the doddfrank act the bhca was amended to require the federal reserve when evaluating a proposed transaction to consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by several federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder the federal reserve issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies the incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the incentive compensation guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the doddfrank act noted below any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the incentive compensation guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets such as mt and mt bank in june the agencies proposed rules to implement this requirement but these proposed rules have not been finalized in october the nysdfs issued guidance emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions including mt bank must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management oversight and control the scope and content of the banking regulators policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of mt and its subsidiaries to hire retain and motivate their key employees resolution planning pursuant to the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bank holding companies are required to report periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure however in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules in october which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv firms such as mt are no longer required to submit resolution plans the fdic has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that currently requires insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets such as mt bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure in april the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions such as mt bank and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete insolvency of an insured depository institution or a bank holding company if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as mt bank or wilmington trust na upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power table start to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor including a newly formed bridge bank without the approval of the depository institutions creditors table end table start to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the fdic in that capacity or table end table start to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution table end in addition under federal law the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of mt bank or wilmington trust na the debt holders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the bank the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime known as orderly liquidation authority for systemically important financial companies including bank holding companies and their affiliates under the orderly liquidation authority the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed subsidiaries for purposes of liquidating the entity if among other conditions it is determined at the time of the institutions failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority then the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution would be determined under the doddfrank act provisions and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply the powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdia however the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors claims under the us bankruptcy code as compared to the treatment of those claims under the new authority nonetheless substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes including the right of the fdic to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity an orderly liquidation fund will fund such liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the treasury department and riskbased assessments made first on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt if an orderly liquidation is triggered mt could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund the fdic has developed a strategy under the orderly liquidation authority referred to as the single point of entry strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed financial holding company would bear the losses resulting from the failure depositor preference under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bhc with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution financial privacy and cyber security the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means in october the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision if established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would be designed to help reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards cyber risk governance cyber risk management internal dependency management external dependency management and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in march the nysdfs implemented regulations requiring financial institutions regulated by the nysdfs including mt bank to among other things i establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of their information systems ii implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information and iii designate a chief information security officer many state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations including implementing or modifying their data breach notification and data privacy requirements for example the california consumer privacy act became effective on january consumer protection laws and the consumer financial protection bureau supervision in connection with their respective lending and leasing activities mt bank wilmington trust na and certain of their subsidiaries are each subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy such laws include the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the fair and accurate credit transactions act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the electronic fund transfer act the real estate settlement procedures act the servicemembers civil relief act and various state law counterparts furthermore the cfpb has issued integrated disclosure requirements under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act that relate to the provision of disclosures to borrowers there are also consumer protection laws governing deposit taking activities eg truth in savings act as well securities and insurance laws governing certain aspects of the companys consolidated operations the doddfrank act established the cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce most federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets including mt bank one of the important rules in governing deposits is the electronic fund transfer act which among other things prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines atm and onetime debit card transactions unless a consumer consents or opts in to the overdraft service for those type of transactions if a consumer does not opt in any atm transaction or onetime debit card transaction sent for approval that exceeds the customers available balance will be declined overdrafts on other types of transactions eg checks recurring debit card transactions and ach transactions are not covered by this rule before opting in the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institutions overdraft services including the fees associated with the service and the consumers choices financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms conditions and features including pricing that they provide to consumers who do opt in the cfpb has issued final rules that change the reporting requirements for lenders under the home mortgage disclosure act the rules expand the range of transactions subject to the requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines the rules also increased the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted including additional data points about loans and borrowers in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations community reinvestment act the cra is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with safe and sound operations cra examinations are conducted by the federal agencies that are responsible for supervising depository institutions the federal reserve the fdic and the occ a financial institutions performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its community is evaluated in the context of information about the institution capacity constraints and business strategies its community demographic and economic data lending investment and service opportunities and its competitors and peers upon completion of a cra examination an overall cra rating is assigned using a fourtiered rating system these ratings are outstanding satisfactory needs to improve and substantial noncompliance the cra evaluation is used in evaluating applications for future approval of bank activities including mergers acquisitions charters branch openings and deposit facilities mt bank has a current rating of outstanding mt bank is also subject to new york state cra examination and is assessed using a to scoring system mt bank currently has an outstanding rating from the nysdfs wilmington trust na has been designated a special purpose trust company since march and is therefore exempt from the requirements of the cra in april the us department of treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the cras implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks in december the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to i clarify which activities qualify for cra credit ii update where activities count for cra credit iii create a more transparent and objective method for measuring cra performance and iv provide for more transparent consistent and timely crarelated data collection recordkeeping and reporting however the federal reserve has not joined the proposed rulemaking the company will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra bank secrecy and antimoney laundering federal laws and regulations impose obligations on us financial institutions including banks and brokerdealer subsidiaries to implement and maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of

institutions antimoney laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bhc acquisitions failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution financial crimes enforcement network which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and mt continues to monitor and augment where necessary its antimoney laundering compliance programs office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally however they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making

reserve policies the earnings of the company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities including the federal reserve among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve are openmarket operations in us government securities and federal funds changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits these instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits the federal reserve frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy especially its openmarket operations and the discount rate to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future it is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies or the effect which they may have on the companys business and earnings corporate governance mts corporate governance standards and the following corporate governance documents are also
