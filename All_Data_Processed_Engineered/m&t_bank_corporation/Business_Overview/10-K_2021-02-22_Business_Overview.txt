doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of egrrcpa us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more including mt are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards the enhanced prudential standards include riskbased capital and leverage requirements liquidity standards risk management and risk committee requirements stress test requirements and a debttoequity limit for companies that the financial stability oversight council has determined would pose a grave threat to systemic financial stability were they to fail such limits in october the federal reserve and the other federal bank regulators adopted rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and of capital and liquidity requirements to bank holding companies and depository institutions the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure and status as a us global systemically important bank holding company gsib under the tailoring rules mt and pursuant to the tailoring rules its depository institution subsidiaries is subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii under the tailoring rules category iv firms among other things are not subject to any liquidity coverage ratio lcr or net stable funding ratio nsfr or in certain cases subject to reduced requirements remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in regulatory capital are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements are subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis rather than an annual basis are subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and are subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements category iv firms continue not to be subject to advanced approaches capital requirements the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer other elements of the tailoring rules are discussed in further detail throughout this section mt will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others capital requirements mt and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies the capital rules which are based on the basel committees december final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards referred to as basel iii among other matters the capital rules impose a capital measure called common equity tier capital cet1 to which most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made in addition the capital rules specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain specified requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows table start cet1 to riskweighted assets table end table start tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets table end table start total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and table end table start tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio table end in calculating regulatory capital ratios mt must assign risk weights to the companys assets and offbalance sheet items mt has an ongoing process to review data elements associated with certain assets that from time to time may affect how specific assets are classified and could lead to increases or decreases of the regulatory risk weights assigned to such assets in march the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators adopted rules to integrate the stress testing regime with ongoing supervisory capital requirements by introducing a dynamic and bespoke stress capital buffer requirement the stress capital buffer for firms subject to ccar supervisory stress tests under the final rule the capital conservation buffer requirement was amended by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with the stress capital buffer which will be based on a firms individual supervisory stress test and cannot be less than of riskweighted assets as applicable to category iv firms mts stress capital buffer which is remains effective for two years commencing on october unless the firms stress capital buffer is reset in connection with a resubmission of a capital plan accordingly it currently is subject to a cet1 capital requirement of a sum of the stress capital buffer and the minimum cet capital ratio during these two years mt is required to maintain its stress capital buffer above its minimum cet1 riskbased tier riskbased and total riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income since march defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters cet1 consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the capital rules including common stock and related surplus net of treasury stock retained earnings certain minority interests and for certain firms aoci as permitted under the capital rules mt made a onetime permanent election to neutralize certain aoci components with the result that those components are not recognized in mts cet1 the capital rules also preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital thus trust preferred securities no longer included in mts tier capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier capital on a permanent basis and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of tier capital set forth in the capital rules mts regulatory capital ratios are presented in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 capital generally became fully phasedin on january except that in november the federal banking regulators revised the capital rules to extend the thencurrent transitional treatment of these deductions for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations the transition rule until revisions to the deductions became effective in july the federal banking regulators adopted rules intended to simplify the deductions for these items for banking organizations such as mt that are not subject to the advanced approaches under the capital rules the capital simplification rules the capital simplifications rules and the rescission of the transition rule were adopted by the company as of january in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the company the impact of basel iv will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal banking regulators stress testing and capital plan review as part of the enhanced prudential requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions the federal reserve conducts periodic analyses of bank holding companies with at least billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the companies have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios generated by the federal reserve for category iv firms such as mt these supervisory stress tests occur on a biennial basis including the federal reserve may also use additional components in the severely adverse scenario or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific business groups a summary of results of the federal reserves analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario is publicly disclosed under the tailoring rules category iv firms including mt are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements however they remain subject to required capital plan submissions and to the associated reporting requirements in addition bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt must submit annual capital plans for approval as part of the federal reserves ccar process the comprehensive capital plans include a view of capital adequacy under various scenarios including a bhcdefined baseline scenario a baseline scenario provided by the federal reserve at least one bhcdefined stress scenario and severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal reserve the ccar process is intended to help ensure that these bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress each of the bank holding companies participating in the ccar process is also required to collect and report certain related data to the federal reserve on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve to monitor progress against the approved capital plans each capital plan must include a view of capital adequacy under the stress test scenarios described above in september the federal reserve issued a proposal to align its ccar process with the categories of standards set forth in the tailoring rules and requested comment on all its capital planning guidance under the proposal for category iv firms the portion of the stress capital buffer based on the federal reserves supervisory stress tests would be calculated every other year during a year in which a category iv firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm would receive an updated stress capital buffer that reflects the firms updated planned common stock dividends a category iv firm would also be able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the firm would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated stress capital buffer in june all bank holding companies participating in ccar including mt were required by the federal reserve to resubmit their capital plans in november in light of the ongoing economic effects of the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic as a result of this resubmission requirement mt and the other bank holding companies participating in ccar have been subject to the limitations on distributions described below since the third quarter of the federal reserve also incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firms capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning mts annual ccar capital plan is currently due in april each year the federal reserve publishes the results of its supervisory stress tests and quantitative ccar review of capital plans by june of each year under the stress capital buffer rule adopted in march a bank holding companys planned capital distributions must be consistent with any effective distribution limitations that would apply under the firms own baseline projections including its stress capital buffer additionally as noted above in march the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators adopted rules to integrate the stress testing regime with supervisory capital requirements by introducing the stress capital buffer for firms subject to ccar supervisory stress tests mts ability to make capital distributions may be impacted in the event that mt fails to maintain its stress capital buffer above its minimum cet1 riskbased tier1 riskbased and total riskbased capital requirements distributions mt is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries historically the majority of mts revenue has been from dividends paid to mt by its subsidiary banks mt bank and wilmington trust na are subject to laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay future dividend payments to mt by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank and are subject to the limitations referred to in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies an insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner including any dividend if after making such distribution the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure including the riskbased capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed herein dividend payments by mt to its shareholders and common stock repurchases by mt are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve as described under stress testing and capital plan review dividends and common stock repurchases net of any new stock issuances as per a capital plan generally may only be paid or made under a capital plan as to which the federal reserve has not objected the final rule implementing the stress capital buffer see above capital requirements also provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with the november resubmission described under stress testing and capital plan review the federal reserve required those bhcs to suspend stock repurchases during the third and fourth quarters of and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the past four quarters in the first quarter of federal reserve rules permit bhcs to repurchase stock and pay dividends at a combined aggregate value of the average of their net income from the previous four quarters liquidity under the tailoring rules the company is not subject to the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators rules which implement a us version of the basel committees lcr requirement which is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of socalled high quality liquid assets hqla to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario or the net stable funding ratio which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards however require the company as a bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for days and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management under the tailoring rules mt also remains subject to liquidity risk management requirements that require the company to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures mt is also subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and is required to report liquidity data on the fr on a monthly basis mt remains subject to the liquidity buffer requirements cross guaranty provision the cross guaranty provisions in the federal deposit insurance act fdia were enacted by congress in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea and require each insured depository institution owned by the same bhc to be financially responsible for the failure or resolution costs of any affiliated insured institution generally the amount of the cross guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the dif for the resolution of the affiliated institutions in default the fdics claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its bhc and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution the fdic may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the dif volcker rule the socalled volcker rule limits proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds defined as covered funds in the volcker rule the company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the volcker rule and implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur in addition the company does not engage in any significant covered fund activities that are impacted by the volcker rule safety and soundness standards guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the fdia establish general standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits in general these guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines additionally the agencies adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties limits on undercapitalized depository institutions the fdia establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions referred to as the prompt corrective action the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed the fdic has specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the federal reserves regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define well capitalized a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status under existing rules a depository institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least ii a tier capital ratio of at least iii a total capital ratio of at least and iv a tier leverage ratio of at least an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than prevailing market rates making acquisitions establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the fdic institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which mt and its nonbank subsidiaries or affiliates mt insurance agency inc mt realty capital corporation mt securities inc wilmington trust na wilmington trust investment advisors inc may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from mt bank and wilmington trust na in general sections and of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w require that any covered transaction by mt bank and wilmington trust na or any of their respective subsidiaries with an affiliate must in certain cases be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited as follows i in the case of any single such affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution and ii in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions of an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution covered transactions are defined by statute to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve from the affiliate certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on terms and under circumstances including credit standards i that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiary as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions or ii that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies fdic insurance assessments mt bank and wilmington trust na deposits are insured by the dif of the fdic up to the limits set forth under applicable law the fdic imposes a riskbased premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for financial institutions deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity for larger institutions such as mt bank the fdic uses a performance score and a lossseverity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic uses a banks capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic acquisitions the bhca requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings institution if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings institution or it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc financial holding companies are required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion the bhca further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues and includes the parties performance under the cra and compliance with laws especially consumer protection laws when evaluating a transaction the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering and consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by several federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder the federal reserve issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies the incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the incentive compensation guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the doddfrank act noted below any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the incentive compensation guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets such as mt and mt bank the agencies proposed rules to implement this requirement but these proposed rules have not been finalized in addition the nysdfs issued guidance emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions including mt bank must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management oversight and control resolution planning pursuant to the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bank holding companies are required to report periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in late in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules that among other things adjusted the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these rules category iv firms such as mt are no longer required to submit resolution plans the fdic has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that requires insured depository institutions idis with billion or more in total assets such as mt bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure in april the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for idis in january the fdic lifted its moratorium on resolution plans required for idis with billion or more in total assets this resumption in resolution planning requirements contemplates periodic engagement with idis and a minimum twelvemonth advance notice prior to a required resolution plan submission insolvency of an insured depository institution or a bank holding company if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as mt bank or wilmington trust na upon its insolvency or in certain other events without limitation the fdic has the power table start to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new depository institution including a newly formed bridge bank without the approval of the insolvent depository institutions creditors or equity holders table end table start to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the fdic in that capacity or table end table start to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution table end in addition under federal law the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of mt bank or wilmington trust na the debt holders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the bank the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime known as orderly liquidation authority for systemically important financial companies including bank holding companies and their affiliates under the orderly liquidation authority the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed subsidiaries for purposes of liquidating the entity if among other conditions it is determined at the time of the institutions failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority then the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution would be determined under the doddfrank act provisions and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply the powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdia however the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors claims under the us bankruptcy code as compared to the treatment of those claims under the new authority nonetheless substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes including the right of the fdic to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity an orderly liquidation fund will fund such liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the treasury department and riskbased assessments made first on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt if an orderly liquidation is triggered mt could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund the fdic has developed a strategy under the orderly liquidation authority referred to as the single point of entry strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed financial holding company would bear the losses resulting from the failure depositor preference under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bhc with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution financial privacy and cyber security the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic and personally identifiable information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means in october the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision if established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would be designed to help reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards cyber risk governance cyber risk management internal dependency management external dependency management and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in may the federal reserve announced that it would revisit the advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the future in december the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require banking organizations to notify their primary regulator within hours of becoming aware of a computersecurity incident or a notification incident the notice of proposed rulemaking also would require specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents in march the nysdfs implemented regulations requiring financial institutions regulated by the nysdfs including mt bank to among other things i establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of their information systems ii implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information and iii designate a chief information security officer many state regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations including

protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets including mt bank in addition federal law permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more

new york state cra examination and is assessed using a to scoring system mt bank currently has a rating of or outstanding from the nysdfs wilmington trust na has been designated a special purpose trust company since march and is therefore exempt from the requirements of the cra in may the occ issued its final cra rule effective october without the other federal banking agencies in september
