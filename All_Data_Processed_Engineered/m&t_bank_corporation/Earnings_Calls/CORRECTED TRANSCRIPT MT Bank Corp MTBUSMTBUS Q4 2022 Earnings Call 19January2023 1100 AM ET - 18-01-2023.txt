thank you brian and good morning everyone as we reflect on we want to start by taking a moment to recognize the hard work and dedication of our more than colleagues your tireless efforts to support our customers and communities during challenging times are the heartbeat of mt we also give a shout out to number three and the early responders who saved his life you remind us all about the bigger game of life a year ago we outlined three key objectives for complete our long awaited merger with peoples united deploy excess liquidity to reduce asset sensitivity while protecting shareholder value and to distribute capital that isnt required to support lending in our communities achieving those objectives we believe aligns with our goal to build a customerfocused bank and resultant balance sheet that produces consistent predictable earnings over long periods of time against those objectives here are a few key highlights of the work done in we closed the acquisition of peoples united the largest in our history we also completed the systems conversion and continue the process of integrating this valuable franchise the financial benefits of this combination are consistent to slightly better than our expectations at announcement we repositioned the balance sheet to deploy excess liquidity reducing our interestbearing deposits held at banks from billion at the end of to under billion at the end of in deploying that excess liquidity we reduced costly wholesale funding we organically that is excluding the impact of peoples grew loans by billion and added billion in net investment securities growth these efforts which also included the retention of most of the residential mortgage production as well as the acquired peoples united billion longerduration securities portfolio have led to a reduction in asset sensitivity helping to protect our net interest margin from future rate shocks in terms of capital we resumed common share repurchases in last years second quarter now having repurchased billion in common stock representing of outstanding shares and our common dividend grew by in representing the sixth year of consecutive increases and despite the impact from the acquisition and the rapid rise in long bond yields our cet1 ratio remained strong at which continues to exceed our median peer bank our hard work translated into strong full year financial results gaapbased diluted earnings per common share which include mergerrelated charges were compared to in down net income was billion compared with billion in the prior year improved by these results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of and compared to and sic respectively in we note that these results were impacted by mergerrelated expenses associated with the peoples united transaction such expenses amounted to million in or per share those same expenses were million or per share in in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity consistent with our longterm practice mt provides mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions we believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the longterm earnings power of the combined institution net operating income which excludes the aftertax impact from the amortization of intangible assets as well as mergerrelated expenses was billion during up compared to with billion in the prior year net operating income per diluted common share was compared with in up net operating income for expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was and this compares with and respectively in the prior year on a net operating basis we generated positive operating leverage and growth in pretax preprovision net revenue this was due in large part to the billion or increase in taxable equivalent net interest income as the net interest margin increased some basis points yearoveryear we are pleased with the results we achieved in in the face of many challenges not the least of which was a rapid shift in monetary policy but our work is not done we will continue to recognize the value created by our merger while building a more capitalefficient less assetsensitive balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term lets take a look at the results for the fourth quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were in the fourth quarter of up compared to in the third quarter of net income for the quarter was million higher than the million in the linked quarter on a gaap basis mts fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million in each of the two most recent quarters representing per common share in both quarters pretax mergerrelated expenses of million related to the peoples united acquisition were included in the fourth quarters gaap results these merger charges translate to million aftertax or per common share mts net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million up from the million in the linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared to in 2022s third quarter net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and in the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the third quarter of both gaap and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of were impacted by certain noteworthy items fourth quarter results included a million gain related to the sale of mt insurance agency reported in other revenue from operations as well as million contribution to mts charitable foundation reported in other costs of operations these items collectively net and did not materially impact net income mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 lets take a deeper dive into the balance sheet and the net interest margin taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in the fourth quarter of an increase of million or from the linked quarter the increase was driven largely by the million impact from higher rates on interestearning assets inclusive of the effect from interest rate hedges an incremental million from volume and mix of earning assets partially offset by a million reduction in interest received on nonaccrual loans net interest margin for the past quarter was up basis points from the in the linked quarter the primary driver of the increase to the margin was higher interest rates which we estimate boosted the margin by basis points in addition the margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit at the federal reserve which we estimate added basis points total average loans and leases were billion during the fourth quarter of up compared to the linked quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the third quarter commercial and industrial loans and leases increased by billion or to billion with billion or growth being broad based across our core commercial banking clients and million or growth in average dealer floor plan balances during the fourth quarter average commercial real estate loans decreased by million or to billion driven largely by declines in average construction loans on an endofperiod basis construction balances increased slightly from the linked quarter permanent average commercial mortgage balances were nearly flat quarteroverquarter residential real estate loans increased million or about to billion due to the continued retention of new mortgage originations retained for investments partially offset by normal amortization average consumer loans were up million or about to billion recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver these average loans grew million or average earning assets excluding interestbearing cash on deposit at the federal reserve increased by billion or due to the billion growth in average loans and billion increase in average investment securities average interestbearing cash balances decreased by billion to billion during the fourth quarter of this year essentially in line with our projections the sequential quarter decline was due to the drop in deposit balances and the cash deployed to fund loan growth and to purchase investment securities average deposits decreased billion or compared with the third quarter our efforts to grow and retain deposits has helped reduce the rate of decline compared to recent quarters however due to the rapidly rising rate environment and increased competition for deposits there has been a mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits average demand deposits declined billion savings and interestbearing checking deposits declined by billion partially offset by a billion increase in time deposits average commercial deposits declined billion as business owners shifted money into both off and on balance sheet sweep accounts paid down debt and made distributions on balance sheet sweep average balances increased billion during the fourth quarter of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 turning to noninterest income noninterest income excluding the million gain from the sale of the mt insurance agency totaled million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the linked quarter trust income was million in the recent quarter up from the million in the third quarter the increase was due largely to the impact of better market valuations on assets under management and administration service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the third quarter the decline primarily reflects the waiver of service charges in october and november on acquired customer deposit accounts these service charges were also waived in september mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter down from the linked quarter revenues from our residential mortgage business were million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter both figures reflect our decision to retain the substantial majority of mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in both the third and fourth quarters that figure was million in the year ago quarter other revenue from operations excluding the gain from the sale of the mt insurance agency were million down million sequentially the decrease was due to the impact of two fewer months of revenues related to the mt insurance agency which was sold in october lower commercial loan fees reflecting lower capital markets activities and a writedown on the underlying assets in certain bank owned life insurance contracts turning to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses were billion or million higher than the linked quarter this increase was largely due to the million charitable donation in the fourth quarter excluding mergerrelated expenses salary and benefits expense decreased by million due to one less business day the realization of acquisition synergies and the impact of the sale of the mt insurance agency the quarter included million in higher sequential advertising and outside data processing and software expenses both of these categories tend to show some degree of seasonality the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2022s third quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year next lets turn to credit despite the challenges of labor shortages and persistent inflation credit remained stable the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the fourth quarter up million from the end of the linked quarter in the fourth quarter we recorded a million provision for credit losses compared to the million provision in the third quarter net chargeoffs were million in the fourth quarter compared to million in last years third quarter the reserve build was largely due to growth in our ci and consumer portfolios the baseline macroeconomic forecast experienced nominal deterioration during the fourth quarter for those indicators that our reserve methodology is most sensitive to including the unemployment rate gdp growth and residential and commercial real estate values at the end of the fourth quarter nonaccrual loans were billion and represented of loans essentially unchanged from the end of the linked quarter as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the fourth quarter compared to basis points in the third quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter compared to million sequentially in total of these days past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the third quarter the decrease was due in part to the impact of the repurchase of million in common shares which represented of our outstanding common stock as well as growth in riskweighted assets tangible common equity totaled billion up slightly from the end of the period of the prior quarter tangible common equity per share amounted to up from the end of the third quarter now turning to the outlook as we look forward into we expect that inflation and higher interest rates will continue to impact the bank and our customers we believe we are well positioned to sustain a strong net interest margin and pretax preprovision net revenue to riskweighted assets with our goal to generate top quartile return on average tangible common equity as a reminder the acquisition of peoples united closed on april thus the outlook for includes four quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only three quarters during this outlook also reflects the sale of mt insurance agency that closed in october of during the first nine months in this business recorded revenues of million and the results of its operations were not material to mts net income additionally in december our subsidiary wilmington trust na announced the sale of its collective investment trust business trust income associated with this business totaled million in and after considering expenses the results of operations from this business were not material to mts net income sale of this business is expected to close in the first half of since the timing of the closing is uncertain this outlook includes the full year of the collective investment trust business first lets talk about our net interest income outlook we expect taxable equivalent net interest income to grow in the to range when compared to the billion during this range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth deposit pricing and loan growth consistent with the current forward curve our forecast incorporates two basis point fed fund hikes in the first quarter of and one basis point cut in the fourth quarter key driver of net interest income in will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth we expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industrywide outflows fullyear average total deposit balances are expected to be down lowsingle digits compared to the billion during in order to offset the deposit declines and to ensure a stable liquidity profile we plan to issue senior debt during we continue to expect deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits as well as on balance sheet sweeps this is expected to translate into a throughthecycle deposit beta in the high to low range next lets discuss the drivers of earning asset growth we currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by billion compared to the billion balance at the end of with the addition of longer duration mortgage backed securities throughout the year next turning to the outlook for average loans we expect average loan and lease balances during to grow in the to range when compared to the full year average of billion this implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of to be flat to slightly up from the billion average during the fourth quarter of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 mix of ci cre and consumer loans inclusive of consumer real estate loans is almost onethird each at the end of we expect this trend to shift slightly as ci growth outpaces cre as weve seen during the second half of higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in turning to fees excluding the million gain on the sale of the mt insurance agency in the fourth quarter of as well as securities losses noninterest income was billion in we expect noninterest income growth to be in the to range compared to the outlook for reflects approximately months of foregone income from mt insurance agency as a result of the sale overall mortgage banking revenues are expected to be up to compared to commercial mortgage banking revenues are expected to rebound in and we will return to a gain on sale residential mortgage banking model in however with the high level of interest rates we expect muted origination volumes and thus anticipate total residential mortgage banking revenues to be relatively stable compared to we expect service charges on deposit accounts to be to higher than and anticipate trust income to be to higher in turning to expenses we anticipate expenses excluding mergerrelated costs the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up to when compared to the billion we experienced during approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of peoples united expenses this outlook also incorporates the impact from the sale of the mt insurance agency we do not anticipate incurring any material mergerrelated costs in and intangible amortization is expected to be in the million to million range during as a reminder first quarter expenses will be elevated as a result of our typical seasonal increase in compensation expense for the first quarter of we anticipate an uptick in the range of million to million that amount last year was approximately million turning to credit we expect credit losses to be higher than the strong results in but to remain below mts legacy longterm average of basis points provision expense over the year will follow the cecl methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as changes in loan balances for we expect taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the range finally turning to capital we believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities we plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace mts common equity tier ratio of at december comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold which takes into account our stress capital buffer or scb with a solid starting cet1 ratio and the potential to generate additional amounts of capital over the next few years we dont expect to change our capital distribution plans we anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares at a pace of million per quarter under our current capital plan before we go to qa i wanted to take a moment and reflect back on some comments made at the beginning of the call where we referenced number three and how he is winning the game of life sometimes numbers can be symbols with deeper meaning than what meets the eye like the divine proportion id like to take a moment and share what i see with some of these numbers the first game after number three went to the hospital our team returned a kickoff the first time it has done so in three years and three months first playoff game was won by three points number and are key leaders on our team the difference between and is three that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 number seems to come up quite often if you look at those key leaders and you drop the in front of and the one in front of youre left with is an interesting number i know youre all thinking about the periodic table of elements is the atomic number of silver the vince lombardi trophy is made out of silver is that interesting but it gets even weirder the symbol for silver is ag if you reverse those letters you get ga which is the abbreviation for georgia the potential site of the afc championship and all of this is happening in theres that number again probably just a set of random coincidences or is it with that lets open it up to questions question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from matt oconnor from deutsche bank brian klock a executive vice president headmarkets and investor relations mt bank corp go ahead matt darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp now weve got you matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry about that i guess sticking in the i think at one point you talked about a longterm nim of to so therere involved there and theyre divisible by and so why dont we kick it off with that darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp all right i guess our outlook for the net interest margin over the long term hasnt changed matt and the question is whats the long term and when we look at the structure of an average bank balance sheet and the mix of funding that is deposits or wholesale funding those costs tend to be pretty competitive and its the mix that ultimately drives the margin over the long run and when you look at where we see our balance sheet going in that of the industry we think thats were in a unique time right now where pricing has not kept deposit pricing has not kept up to rates on loans and thats ultimately going to close and so will we see that in those numbers unlikely but as we go into and will we start to see the margin move back down into those normal historic ranges we think so and the most important thing about why we talk about that is we dont want to set up the bank and the expense structure assuming that margins like that are going to hold because recent history suggests thats just not likely if it happens to thats great but we dont want to build the bank so that were counting on those kinds of margins for the expense run rate that we have mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so three years once again three popping up to normalize on the nim but did i miss any comments on the nim for or most importantly what youre modeling for the fourth quarter of this year thank you darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp for the first or the fourth matt sorry matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc both on the full year and then most importantly the fourth quarter of what are you thinking on the nim and then i think that would assume both the forward curve and then i think commercial loans tend to reprice a little bit sooner than maybe fed funds move so if you have a estimate and then framing of puts and takes which its helpful including with the repricing earlier the commercial loans darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure if you look at the year based on our current outlook we think the average nim for the year stays above you probably see a little move up in the first quarter just because of the impact of day count and so youll see it pop up but actually its quite likely that net interest income in dollars might actually be lower will likely be lower in the first quarter of than it was in the fourth quarter of taking into account that forward curve thats relatively flat but starts to see some cuts at the end of the year we think the margin will be higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year and probably heads down towards as we get to the fourth quarter of matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from john pancari from evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 also i wondered if you could talk a little bit about any efforts here to protect the nim at that level particularly as we look at potential cuts in the third pivot anything in terms of balance sheet positioning that we should be considering in terms of beyond what youre already doing to protect the nim at these levels darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah theres a few things john that weve been working on all this year to start to protect the nim first youve seen us increase the size of the securities portfolio and weve talked a little bit about growing that a little bit further in within there we also anticipate shifting the duration a little bit weve taken some duration so far in on the balance sheet in the mortgage portfolio well slow that down and well take that duration in the securities portfolio with some mbs well also be doing we mentioned some term funding which well lock that in which will also help and then the thing that ultimately is the biggest benefit to maintaining the margin and reducing asset sensitivity is deposit pricing right and so its a little bit painful when its compressing on the way up when its catching up to the loan pricing but ultimately the best way to combat declining rates is through repricing of deposits and so those three things would be the biggest help we will and continue to have a hedge portfolio that helps reduce some of the asset sensitivity in the short term might help the nim of some of the earlier hedges that were put on that are a lower received fixed rate rolloff and so those are kind of the three major things that will have helped us reduce our asset sensitivity and will help us protect the nim at these kind of higher levels as time goes on john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay so no major change in terms of the hedging swaps other than what is rolling off correct darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes well see how much we grow from where we are at the end of the first quarter because of the position of the balance sheet and what well do will likely not be to add to outstanding notional but to add to forward starting is likely what we would do john pancari q analyst evercore group llc right got it okay thanks and then just one other followup on the commercial real estate front can you maybe give us an update on what youre seeing there in terms of credit trends maybe trends in delinquencies in criticized assets and any kind of distress in the office portfolio that would help darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes sure within in the commercial real estate portfolio the biggest trend that weve had going on for probably the last four quarters is just the reduction in the construction portfolio and so a large number of construction projects were originated in late and during and as the pandemic went they continued but at a slower pace and those have been coming to completion this year and as those have come to completion theyve turned into permanent mortgage financing oftentimes not on our balance sheet and so youve seen the decline in commercial real estate largely being construction related mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 when we look underneath at some of the major categories and we look at the criticized we actually have seen hotel criticized balances peak probably about two or three quarters ago it got as high as about of our hotel portfolio its now down below and if were seeing remixing in the criticized theres two categories one is healthcare which weve talked about a little bit before and thats typically assisted living and senior housing and thats not from a lack of demand that were seeing some challenges in that portfolio its their ability to staff and so weve seen occupancy rates in these portfolios come up post pandemic but theyre not able to get all the way back to prepandemic levels because theres not enough staff to adequately care for the folks that want to live there and then the other place obviously were looking at is office and were paying a lot of attention to office the portfolio i think is as of the end of the year right around criticized were watching lease expirations and lease signups the vast majority of our real estate portfolio has lease expirations out and later so far what weve seen is decent renewing we are seeing some movement down in price per square foot but what weve been doing is going through all of the lease portfolios sorry the office portfolios and stressing both vacancy rates and lease rates to see what the debt service coverage ratio is and what making sure that weve got adequate coverage if we talk about our expectations for chargeoffs in as we go into this year thats the place where wed have the most concern when we talk about chargeoffs moving up from the levels weve seen in it will be some of those portfolios is the place where weve really got our eye john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thank you darren thats very helpful and frankly i hope the number three is the number of touchdowns the eagles win the super bowl by this year but darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp we appreciate that its been a long tough year up here little good news would be nice operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hi darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 just wanted to ask about just i guess a followup on the office book if you could just remind us where that total office exposure is and then specifically the exposure in new york city darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes not a problem you should youll see this when the 10k comes out but the office exposure in total is right around billion when you look at whats in new york city its about that would be new york city its pretty widespread across predominantly the northeast frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a followup on cre in terms of i think you mentioned that the permanent cre book was sort of flattish linked quarter with construction balances rolling off and it sounded like i just want to make sure i understand for is the expectation that that permanent cre book will grow just to a lesser extent than the ci book or do you still or are you still looking for outflows in that or thinking about outflows in that cre book thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes yes overall frank were thinking that the overall cre book does continue to drift down but at a much slower rate than what weve seen in it will be a modest decline well on average its actually going to be up because of the peoples united but if you look versus the fourth quarter the permanent book on average is relatively flat compared to where the fourth quarter was and most of the decline would continue to be in the construction side of things remind you the construction portfolio is the one that is one of the ones that tends to carry higher loss rates in the stress test which is part of the reason why weve been working to obviously support our customers so that they can finish the projects but then to not add meaningfully to that once those reach their completion and find permanent financing frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin from jefferies go ahead ken brian klock a executive vice president headmarkets and investor relations mt bank corp maybe well continue on and well catch ken in a little bit operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just maybe on the balance sheet so you mentioned about billion in securities purchases from billion at yearend if you dont mind reminding us like what that implies for the cash balance as we think about on a steady state i think cash was about billion over the fourth quarter is billion the right place where the bank expects to be and how much of that might go away from a deposit runoff so just thought process around that darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes there will be some movement ebrahim between cash and securities over the course of the year if you look at the as at at the end of the year probably down in the billion range if you look at the average for the year probably thinking slightly below billion between billion and billion is probably the spot that number is going to move around a little bit obviously depending on outflows in deposits as well as our funding needs to support loan growth as well as to make sure were managing the banks liquidity profile and so those will move around a little bit over the course of the year but those are kind of round numbers where were forecasting ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and im sorry if i missed it you talked about issuing some debt did you quantify how much in debt do you expect to issue through the course of the year darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i didnt mention a number obviously that this is dynamic right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp and that the amount is going to be a function of whats happening with deposit funding and runoff and whatnot but right now we think its in the billion to billion range over the course of ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and what would be the cost of the debt today given just the shape of the yield curve im just wondering if its better to lock in term funding relative to short term right now based on the market mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp well its a great question theres obviously the rate is depending on the tenor right and right now theres a you like the opportunity to reprice the shorterdated notes but theyre trading higher than the longerterm debt and so we think low to mid is the range of yield on that depending on the term and what well be trying to do since weve really brought down the level of wholesale funding at the bank will be to not lock in all in one tenor but to start to build a more balanced maturity profile as we think about the funding of the bank so that we dont have massive amounts coming due all at the same time and so i think as you think about it think about not being all one tenor and one type of but something that starts to build a little bit of a profile that is spread out over the next few years ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just on a separate note the cre book or the cre office do you have the debt service coverage ratios handy in terms of where they were at the end of the year darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i dont know that i have that right off the top of my at the tip of my fingers here give me one second and let me see if i can find it but it has in aggregate that portfolio has still been above and when we look at the ltvs in that portfolio they still run below on a weighted average basis now obviously there are some above that and some below but as we look at it right now and we look at the clients ability to support the asset either with cash flow or with how much equity they have in the property we feel pretty comfortable with where we sit but were watching it as weve talked about theres its one of the places where we see the most risk and where were focusing a lot of our attention from a credit perspective ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator next question comes from manan gosalia from morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i was hoping you can break down your loan growth guidance for next year in the past youve spoken about the lending synergies from the peoples acquisition and the footprint there i think you mentioned small business card and equipment finance so just if you can break down how you see that contributing to loan growth in and how you see that evolving darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes i guess as we look at peoples impact on from a loan perspective its certainly additive but its one of those things where the loan balances take a little bit of time to build and to show up in a material way so when we look at we continue our focus on ci and we expect to see strong growth in the ci portfolio over on an average basis it prints a big number because its four quarters of peoples and not just three and so mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 20ish percent over the average in but outside of that it comes down a little bit more like into the to range theres a bunch of pieces in there one of the ones that we talked about that impacted the fourth quarter was our dealer floor plan business and what weve seen is some inventory builds as supply chains open up and consumer purchases slowed down a little bit with rising rates and so we saw some movement there we did see some broadbased movement in our core commercial customer the leasing business where we prefer to call it our equipment finance business continues to show steady growth which would show up in the ci balances and then the other thing where well be intensely focused is on building out our small business and business banking segment thats one of the places where we see a great opportunity in the new england franchise and to deploy our methods of banking when you look at the other portfolio cre we talked about relatively flat to slight somewhat down the consumer real estate also flat to down and thats really thats the consumer mortgage business and thats really just a reflection of normal amortization and because we will stop holding the originations well go back to gain on sale and then we think the consumer portfolio slows down a little bit again just because of the interest rates and the pace of activity in terms of car buying as well as recreational vehicle purchases the one offset there which is also a peoples related thing but unfortunately it doesnt grow the balances that much as we expect to launch our credit card into the peoples united markets which will help grow credit card balances but as i mentioned they are still relatively small and so hard to see in the balance growth but nice from a margin perspective one of the other things that is in the peoples franchise which we like is weve talked about it before the mortgage warehouse lending business but its a tough part of the cycle for the mortgage warehouse lending business that with refinance activity almost nonexistent and purchase a little bit low but the balances there are likely to still be a headwind we dont think that they go down materially from here but they wont go back to where they were in and without a decrease in the longterm mortgage rates manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats really helpful i think youve also mentioned in the past that ci is benefiting now because theres less capital markets activity are you assuming some sort of reversal in your guide darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp were cautious about the level of economic activity and seeing some slowdown in inflation in gdp and what that translates into in terms of demand from our clients its really not much more than that there isnt any sign that we see that were seeing a material slowdown or were not seeing credit concerns were just seeing cautiousness while people wait to see how the economy plays out in and so were cautious on it as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just a followup on one of the prior questions on the stress test youve spoken about the adverse effects of the excess cash balances and of course the fed has been stressing cre more than the other mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 asset classes just given that december will be used as a starting point for the next stress test do you think youve done enough or how well do you think youre positioned going into that thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp weve certainly made a meaningful shift in the balance sheet this year cash balances we mentioned are down the better part of billion from where they were at the end of last year the mix of ci and cre when we focus just on commercial balances is almost where it was before cre and when we look at the construction balances theyre down a couple of billion dollars and not to mention the margin is up and so the ppnr start point is higher things that weve got our eye on and were uncertain a little bit is how the merger expenses will be treated in the stress test this year but once we get through it should be clean and so that will be helpful and then the other question is whats the fed scenario right we havent seen it yet its very likely that it will continue to focus in the real estate sector previously it focused on hotel and retail those seem to be doing a little bit better so it wouldnt surprise us if the new focus is office and healthcare and so it just depends on where the emphasis is from that perspective as well but we start from a really strong capital position weve got the current scb covered which is pretty high and we continue to move the balance sheet in a positive direction which if it doesnt get us all the way where we want to be in it should carry us long ways towards where we want to be in manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful thanks so much for taking my questions operator and our next question comes from ken usdin from jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks sorry about before darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc how is it going guys darren on the cost side you mentioned obviously the conversions being passed can you give us an update on what proportion of the initially expected million of saves from peoples were in the fourth quarter run rate and if not fully there when do you expect to get there darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 yeah ken the vast majority of the saves are in there through the end of the fourth quarter if you think about we were targeting of the cost base were like or something in that range is what weve achieved so far when you look at it on a percentage basis were almost there when we look at it on a dollar basis the run rate is actually a little bit higher than we thought it would be because of inflation ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp when we talk about the percentage of save its still the same and so some of that will come out over the course of the year were carrying a little bit higher staffing in the branches as we stabilize a little bit higher staffing in some of the call centers and so those things will normalize themselves over the course of the year but when we look at where we sit from my perspective we pretty much closed the book on the cost saves that we expected to achieve couple of other things that have worked out very positive is the onetime expenses turned out to be a little bit less than we thought we incurred a little bit less than severance expense we also incurred a little bit less than some contract terminations than we thought at due diligence and the nice thing is the peoples was an assetsensitive franchise and with rates going up the nii is coming in better than we thought and so the ppnr is a little bit higher than we expected so overall the numbers that we thought we would realize post close and post conversion are in line to slightly better than what we thought and were almost back to breakeven on tangible book value so overall were very very positive about where things sit early on and as we mentioned before excited to go to work in new england and bring mts brand of banking into that new market ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great so then one followup to that is then if thats the case that youre pretty run rated then we can all take a look at the kind of implied underlying expense growth off of this fourth quarter and knowing that you have the seasonal stepup in the first so can you just kind of frame that for us just what do you think about that organic side whats driving it in terms of the initiatives that youre focusing the most in terms of incremental expense growth from here darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah the biggest driver of that is compensation and when you look at we made some meaningful adjustments to our associates compensation we raised the minimum wage weve been dealing with competition for talent like everyone has and compensation expense is about of our total expense base and so when you look at the driver of that growth its really that compensation cost thats driving it outside of that the other line item youll see where well be investing and have been is in outside data processing and software you know that i think for us and for the industry you see more and more reliance on purchased mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 software and with those future software contracts come licenses and maintenance fees which tend to go up every year and the other place well probably see a little bit of growth is in advertising and promotion as we continue to stabilize the franchise and introduce ourselves in new england well see an uptick in that as we go forward and then kind of normalize into what i would describe as a normal percentage of our operating expense over time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning steven how are you doing steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good i want to start so looking at this quarter was the second quarter where you funded loan growth with excess liquidity talking about issuing subdebt when do you think youll start growing deposits again is this back half and where do you see the loantodeposit ratio trending through the year maybe ending the year darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp well theres always an ability to grow deposits its just at what cost right and so were always looking at number one our focus is on customers and customer relationships and so for situations where we would have single service time deposits or money market accounts we may not choose pay rate there because we can fund the bank more efficiently in the wholesale markets but for customers who are operating account customers which is our core funding base and part of our longterm strategy then were more willing to pay rate and so were always making that tradeoff and so to say that its going to officially end in the second half of the year i think would be a little foolhardy but our idea is obviously there will be a spot you get to where customers maintain balances in their checking accounts if youre a consumer or your operating account if youre a business and you kind of hit that floor and when will that floor hit i think we start to see it as rates stabilize and youll see that as we go through but also we know that that deposit pricing lags movements in fed funds and lags movements in loans and so our goal will be to stabilize it as we go through the year but obviously making those tradeoffs that i mentioned as we work with clients mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then so where do you see the loantodeposit ratio moving darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp oh sorry right i think over time and again time maybe lets call it three years aha just to tick on our number three is over the long term loantodeposit ratios for us and for the industry will trend back to their longterm average and when we think about those loantodeposit ratios and those longterm averages thats also part of the reason why we talk about that net interest margin over the long run normalizing back to where its been historically and so were kind of we think maybe around 80ish a little bit above as we get to the end of sorry but its obviously a function of how we choose to pay and fund the bank steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions operator and our last question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i was going to say i know the three was in the middle of the call your stock was up but now its up over that so i cant use that darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp well we appreciate that and the three reference theres something that happens in every call and it kind of seems to run its course so three is this one gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go a question for you regarding your comments about the commercial real estate portfolio mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc when you look at it particularly for office theres a concern of course with the work from home possibly being more permanent and therell be less space needed possibly vacancy rates go up in the office space what do you think is the greater risk the occupancy rates going higher because of that trend or the refinancing risk where your customers having to refinance because their mortgages are terming out they have to refinance it and the rates are just so much higher today than when people took on these mortgages maybe five years ago darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp right so i think its hard gerard to pinpoint it on one or the other because they work together right i mean if occupancy and price per square foot was okay or holding up then you probably got the coverage to refinance when your loan is due i remind you when we underwrite whether its multifamily office or hotel we underwrite to longterm interest rates and longterm occupancy rates and so weve got some protection built in with our clients when we underwrite so theres a little bit of room there but as we look at it i think in the short term its the refinance risk is a little bit bigger over the long run we debate this a lot internally and we go back and forth with our chief credit officer that this trend of more remote work hard to handicap where thats going to end up right you can see some changes in the economy you see some movements with some of the tech firms with employment that may or may not drive people back into the office we dont know but when you see younger people early in their professional career you can see the benefits to being colocated with their coworkers and so that trend i think ultimately starts to come back is it five days a week probably not but its not going to be zero at least this is darrens opinion so take it for what its worth to me the bigger issue is when you look long term at the population theres a big chunk of the population called the baby boomers that are approaching retirement age there are not enough of them to come in the up in the next wave to use all the space that they needed to sit in to be employed and thats a longer term cyclical trend which will affect these things and so theres going to be some pain in the short term no doubt over time rates will move up and down and refinancings will happen there will be some movement in and out but to me the longer term trend is whats happening with the population and the working population and whats the capacity that exists today versus what the likely future looks like absent any other changes in politics and i will leave it at that before we get into a discussion i dont want to get into gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure as a followup question based upon your experience and your conversations with your colleagues at mt what do you think is driving what were seeing today where the cecl reserve build you and your peers obviously have to take a look at the economic forecast many people use moodys which is weaker this quarter than last quarter which drove up reserves mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 but at the same time i think you mentioned your net chargeoff numbers are expected this year to be below your through the cycle levels spreads in many areas highyield securities or even one of your peers said that corporate loan spreads havent widened out yet whats going on where were not seeing i dont think some metrics telling us were going to have a tough downturn whereas the reserve build is pointing to a weaker economy darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think gerard to me when i think about the way we all set aside reserves its weighted heavily on your economic forecast and your rs period your reasonable and supportable period which for a lot of the industry is the first couple of years and then theres a reversion to the longterm average and so what youre seeing today is the current view where the chargeoffs are well below the longterm average and so the allowance is always going to take that the long term into account and then youre forecasting and bringing forward those losses based on the assumptions that go into the rs period and the expectation for unemployment to go up and for gdp to come down is there its in the baseline for moodys its moved a little bit most people like us will not just look at the baseline but look at a more severe economic scenario as well as a better one and you kind of weight those and it doesnt necessarily need to be what you see today in the pricing and the spreads versus whats in the forecast they should be connected but theyre not always right and theres always going to be points in time where these disconnects exist and so we look at them we think about the provision is keeping the bank safe its capital by another form but as we underwrite business were always looking at each individual relationship and its ability to pay back and the spreads are going to be a reflection of the expectation of that credit risk through the cycle and so for us weve had so many longterm relationships where weve seen the behavior of these clients through the cycle and their willingness to step up and many times bring outside resources to help maintain their payments and stay accruing and so each organization is different but that to me is a little bit of why you might see a disconnect between whats actually pricing today versus whats in the cecl outlook gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and just quickly on the cecl outlook what was the weighted unemployment rate that you guys came up with in your analysis you mentioned you as the base case but you also took into account the more severe case as well darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah were kind of in the ph range on gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp on unemployment in the base and thats during the rs period obviously right and so mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp youre once you get past that then youre reverting to the long term gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay appreciate
