21jan2021 darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks don and good morning everyone and happy new year before we get into the details ill touch on just a few highlights in the recent quarters results ppp loan forgiveness ramped up in the fourth quarter average ppp loans declined by million compared with the third quarter and were down billion on an endofperiod basis this resulted in the accelerated recognition of million of ppp loan fees into net interest income during the quarter in addition to the impact of accelerated ppp loan fees net interest income increased as a result of improved deposit pricing across all customer segments notwithstanding the ppp forgiveness average loans were up during the quarter including growth in dealer floor plan loans and mortgage loans purchased from servicing pools fee revenues held up well particularly trust income due to continued strong capital markets and service charges due to the improved economic activity expenses were impacted by costs relating to the migration of our retail brokerage platform to lpl financial and were otherwise in line with our expectations as to credit we saw an increase in nonaccrual loans this quarter that is consistent with the higher expected credit losses that we provided for earlier in the year while cre loans came off covid forbearance and net chargeoffs rose to a level just above our longterm average capital levels remained strong with our cet1 ratio growing to at yearend well review the numbers for the full year in a moment but first lets turn to the results of the fourth quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were in the fourth quarter of compared with in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linkedquarter and million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis mts fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million compared with million in the linkedquarter and million in last years fourth quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2020s third quarter and in the fourth quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the third quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity included in the recent quarters results was a million distribution from bayview lending group this amounted to million aftertax effect and per common share we expect that this distribution occurred in place of usual distribution we have received from bayview lending group in the first quarter of the past few years mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the fourth quarter of marking an increase of million or from the linkedquarter the primary driver of that increase was the accelerated recognition of million of fees on ppp loans following forgiveness of those loans by the small business administration the net interest margin increased by basis points to compared with in the linkedquarter the accelerated recognition of ppp fees added an estimated basis points to the margin a basis point decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits repayment of debt outstanding and slightly higher income from our hedge portfolio boosted the margin by an estimated basis points continued inflows of excess liquidity including dda and interest checking resulted in a billion increase in cash on deposit with the federal reserve while this had a negligible impact on net interest income it contributed to about basis points of pressure on the net interest margin all other factors including lower premium amortization on acquired mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities provided an approximate basis point benefit to the margins average total loans increased by million or about compared to the previous quarter looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linkedquarter commercial and industrial loans declined by million or about contributing to that decline was a million decline in ppp loans primarily reflecting loan forgiveness partially offsetting that was a million increase in floor plan loans as dealers seek to rebuild inventories following a very robust sales year all other ci loans declined by million largely from lower line utilization wed note that on an endofperiod basis dealer loans were up million and all other ci loans were roughly flat excluding the ppp forgiveness commercial real estate loans grew just over compared with the third quarter primarily the result of further draws on preexisting loans new originations in the cre space remained subdued residential real estate loans increased by million or reflecting loans purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools pending resolution partially offset by repayments consumer loans were up reflecting higher indirect auto and recreation finance loans partially offset by lower home equity lines of credit average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office as well as cds over grew by billion or compared with the third quarter reflecting higher interest and noninterest checking as well as money market deposit accounts turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter that increase reflects the million distribution from bayview lending group that i previously mentioned the recent quarter also included million of valuation gains on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while the third quarter included million of such gains mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were billion in the quarter unchanged from the third quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the decrease reflects a lower gain on sale margin and residential servicing revenues declined very slightly mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled million encompassing both originations and servicing the improvement from the third quarter was mainly a result of higher origination volumes trust income was million in the recent quarter up slightly from million in the previous quarter business remains solid with slightly higher money market fund fee waivers more than offset by higher levels of assets managed and continued good capital markets activity service charges on deposit accounts were million improved from million in the third quarter the improvement is largely the result of increased economic activity that resulted in growth in paymentsrelated income excluding the blg distribution the improvement in other revenues from operations compared with the linkedquarter also reflected an uptick in credit cardrelated activity turning to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were million compared with million in the third quarter salaries and benefits declined by million from the prior quarter in accordance with the previously announced contract with lpl financial mt took its first steps to transition its retail brokerage and advisory business to the lpl platform in doing so mt incurred million of transition expenses including severance payments included in salaries and benefits and a contract termination payment that is included in other costs of operations also included in other costs of operations is a million addition to the valuation allowance for our mortgage servicing asset this follows additions of million to the allowance in each of the first and second quarters of the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of next lets turn to credit under cecl and as a result of the pandemic driven economic slowdown mt added million to its allowance for credit losses over the course of while delinquencies nonaccrual loans and net chargeoffs have until recently remained relatively benign in the cecl environment statistical models help predict expected loss content which must be reserved for well in advance of default the old loss reserving process didnt permit establishment of an allowance until loss content became incurred thus loss reserves and chargeoffs generally rose as delinquencies and nonaccruals increased were beginning to see the expected rise in nonaccrual loans and chargeoffs that have already been reserved for under the cecl methodology net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the fourth quarter compared with basis points in the third quarter its interesting to note that the chargeoff rate in the fourth quarter approximated our longterm average during the quarter we restructured substantially all of our limited exposure to the operators of regional malls these had been under stress prior to the covid19 pandemic which resulted in further deterioration and pushed them into default the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter amounted to million which was million less than net chargeoffs the allowance for credit losses declined slightly to billion or of loans that ratio was of loans at the end of september mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 as has been the case since the beginning of the allowance at the end of the fourth quarter reflects an updated macroeconomic scenario the scenario is different and less severe than those used at the end of the first and second quarters and modestly less severe than that used at the end of the third quarter each of which model the uncertainty of the covid19 driven damage to the economy in addition to losses that may be expected from newly originated loans the allowance and the related provision for the recent quarter continued to reflect the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic on economic activity the uncertainty over additional economic stimulus and the ultimate collectability of commercial real estate loans most notably in the hospitality sector and retail sectors outside of the regional mall exposure our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes the national unemployment rate continues to be at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of the forecast assumes that gdp grows at a annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to pre recession levels by the end of our forecast considers government stimulus but not any further fiscal or monetary actions nonaccrual loans as of december rose to billion an increase of million from the end of september that increase came primarily from the transfer to nonaccrual status of a handful of hotel relationships totaling million at the end of the quarter nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans was it is important to keep in mind that some of the usual credit metrics have been affected by the ppp loans on the balance sheet which are zero riskweighted and carry little or no credit risk excluding the impact of ppp loans the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans would be similarly the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans would be and annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans would be basis points loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter of these loans million or are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities government guaranteed loans under covid forbearance and which we have purchased from servicing tools are generally not reflected in these figures as we noted on the october conference call in the third and in the third quarter 10q total loans under covid related modifications declined to billion as of september those figures declined further to billion at the end of the fourth quarter commercial and industrial loans with covidrelated modifications declined from million to million at the end of of that figure less than million of those loans still have a form of payment deferral covid forbearances other than payment deferrals relate to things such as fee waivers and in some cases covenant waivers similarly commercial real estate loans under covidrelated modification declined from billion at the end of the third quarter to billion at december some million of those loans have received a payment deferral mortgagerelated loans under covidrelated modifications were billion at the end of the third quarter and that figure declined to billion as of the end of the fourth quarter remaining consumer loan modifications also declined to less than million mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 modification or forbearance status has not prevented us from updating loan grades within our commercial portfolio the pace of downgrades into criticized slowed meaningfully in the fourth quarter rising about from the end of the prior quarter turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated as of december compared to at the end of the third quarter this reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends paid and slightly higher riskweighted assets next id like to take a moment to cover some of mts highlights of the past year overall we believe the events of provided an illustration of the operational and financial resilience of mts franchise our colleagues performed like champions dare i say like division champions switching with barely a ripple to the workfromhome environment helping clients through the extraordinary challenges presented by the lockdowns that all but brought the economy to a standstill and helping customers navigate the ppp loan process that resulted in billion of originations the severe economic conditions brought about by the covid19 pandemic and the resultant zero interest rate environment had a material impact on our financial results including a decline in preprovision net revenue and a decline in net income partly the result of cecl accounting key financial highlights for the year were as follows gaapbased diluted earnings per common share were compared with in the net income was billion compared with billion in the prior year these results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of and respectively net operating income was billion compared with billion in the prior year net operating income for expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was and respectively average diluted common shares declined by the result of repurchase activity in as well as the limited repurchases in the first quarter of prior to the pandemic the total payout ratio for the year including common stock dividends was approximately tangible book value per share grew to at the end of up from the end of and despite the challenges for the year our cet1 ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of now lets turn to the outlook were all pleased to see that the economy has continued to improve the rollout of the vaccine holds the promise of a return to normalcy but we continue to face pressures starting with the balance sheet there are more moving parts than we would see in a typical year ppp loans on our balance sheet amounted to billion at the end of the year we expect that substantially all of those loans will be repaid or forgiven in with the bulk of that occurring in the first half of the year that process will be beneficial to net interest income and net interest margin in the quarters in which the small business administration actually forgives the loans similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter this week we began accepting customer applications for ppp round two we expect these new loans to offset the decline in the original ppp balances to a certain extent mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 another atypical element of the balance sheet as we enter is the level of cash and securities it is our practice to maintain cash and securities such that we maintain sufficient liquidity and hqla to meet our internal liquidity governance the various stimulus programs enacted in have resulted in mt along with our peers carrying higher levels of cash than normal we believe that at yearend we were holding close to billion more in cash and securities than we would need under normal circumstances the excess cash has little impact on net interest income but significantly impacts the net interest margin every billion in cash impacts the margin by to sorry basis points to basis points one of the ways weve chosen to deploy the excess cash is through buyouts of ginnie mae mortgages from the pools of loans that we service or subservice those buyouts create net interest income in the short term and fee income in the longterm when those loans return to performing status and may be sold to investors as previously discussed the active cash flow hedge position on our floating rate loan portfolio has increased to billion in the fourth quarter and remains at that level until late this year however the fixed receive rate will decline as older swaps mature and newer forward starting swaps become active holding the unusual aspects of the balance sheet to the side we expect total loans to be relatively flat in commercial and industrial loans excluding ppp are expected to be flat to up slightly as increased economic activity leads to increased line utilization cre loans are expected to be flat to slightly down with a subdued outlook for new originations and slowing draws on prepandemic loans consumer loans are expected to grow at a midsingle digit pace all in we expect low to midsingle digit yearoveryear decline in net interest income primarily the result of the challenging yearoveryear rate environment turning to fees we expect lowsingle digit yearoveryear growth in noninterest revenues similar to we believe the strong originations trends in mortgage banking will continue but with continued pressures on gain on sale margins that outlook also reflects our ability to resell the loans purchased from servicing pools which could be delayed depending on state and federal payment and foreclosure holidays trust income should be flattish with the full year impact of money fund fee waivers offset by growth in other categories this also assumes some growth in assets managed combined with some stability in market values we expect service charges to reflect the run rate in the fourth quarter and to improve on a full yearoveryear basis receipt of the bayview lending group distribution this quarter pulled forward million of revenue we previously expected to receive in turning to expenses based on our expectations for growth in some fee revenue categories primarily mortgage banking revenues and trust income we expect expenses tied directly to those businesses will grow as well outside of those increases we expect all other expense categories in the aggregate to be generally flat with the prior year overall we expect expenses to be flat to up less than the trend in credit provisioning should show improvement in line with the macroeconomic outlook chargeoffs given the nature of the portfolio and the sectors most impacted by the pandemic will be lumpy and will likely take longer to emerge that said we anticipate chargeoffs will be higher in and likely higher than our longterm average given the uncertainty we will focus our credit outlook on the nearterm and for the first quarter of we dont currently foresee chargeoffs higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 lastly turning to capital the board has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock we will continue to operate within the guidelines currently in effect by the federal reserve as well as taking into account the economic environment our earnings outlook and capital position and any alternate capital deployment opportunities of course as you are aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open up the call to questions before which maria will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you i guess maybe starting off you mentioned that youre certainly sitting on a huge amount of excess cash versus kind of where you normally have been theres obviously a lot of debate around whether its prudent to invest the excess deposits in low rates or lowyielding securities or keep it in cash how are you guys balancing that debate and where do you come out on it thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah good morning ken and thanks for the question its a discussion that we have every other week at our alco meetings and our debate is always how long the cash will hang around given the way it showed up on the balance sheet it just really exploded in the second half of the year and that impacts our decision and thought process about what kind of duration to take on and so in the shortterm as we worked our way through that thought process holding it in cash versus investing it in shortterm treasuries there really isnt much of a basis point gain from doing that and so were looking at alternative ways where we can get maybe a little bit better spread or yield on that cash without setting up a tremendous amount of duration risk one of the things we mentioned in the prepared remarks was weve been using that cash for buyouts of ginnie mae securities and we found that to be an attractive use of cash in the shortterm because it offsets an expense the spread on those is better than what we would get on oneyear treasuries and it creates the opportunity for some fee income so well look for other opportunities like that well watch and see how the ppp goes and what the net change in loan balances is and then well continue to watch the rate curve and the environment and well keep our powder dry but its something we continue to look at on a regular basis to see where we can put some of that money to work because obviously were not paid to hold cash so thats always our objective but were trying to be prudent with how much duration risk we might be taking on mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great helpful and then maybe just a followup question can you just talk a little bit more about the i think you mentioned million worth of hotel credits that were transferred to nonaccrual id love to learn more about the credit quality of those darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure im happy to discuss that when we look at those credits i guess i dont need to take off my shoes and socks to count the number of them which is a good thing so we know exactly how many there are we know exactly where they are and weve had a longstanding relationship with many of these all of these clients when i look at the loan to values of the top lets say we looked at the top most are or below now that obviously is primarily based on ad origination but we still havent seen a material decrease in asset prices in the market with anything thats traded weve seen the cmbs market come back a little bit as we got to the end of the year which also should help sustain asset prices and a couple of the downgrades are full relationships and so theres a couple of larger ones but its not just one single property its multiple properties and so theres good collateral behind these and good longstanding relationships we can see some level of occupancy in the hotels they tend to be in the larger cities and so as the larger cities start to see more either business travel or tourism theyll start to come back but where we sit right now we feel comfortable that we have our arms around these and we have good visibility into them and are able to watch them closely and so i would just view this as what would be the normal progression when youre in one of these economic cycles right that you start to see signs of delinquency some of these were in the forbearance and now theyve gone to nonaccrual and whats interesting about the new cecl environment is that you kind of take the provision and set up the reserve before you see stuff in non accrual and so these are just kind of catching up to that provisioning and generally we called out hotels because when you look outside of hotels a lot of the cre trends are actually pretty solid outside of that theres really not a lot of concern today in multifamily retail portfolio has actually done reasonably well and then were actually seeing some parts of the portfolio not necessarily cre related but seeing some upgrades like in the dealer book and that the dealers have done have just had a fantastic year and in some cases had record profits and so thats really the sector that were watching and thats obviously why we did made that move with those loans and classifying them as nonaccrual kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it did you have to did you build any incremental reserve associated with those credits when they went to nonaccrual darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp no there wasnt anything material those that was in effect accounted for in the provisioning that we had done through the prior three quarters of the year mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the back to that million was the was that a result of a more of a deeper dive into those credits this quarter that resulted them all moving to nonaccrual this quarter or was it just how it played out in terms of them coming off of forbearance darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah john its really the latter weve been able to identify in the hotel portfolio on a credit by credit basis right from the start and being able to pay attention to each one of these relationships working with them understanding what their noi is and how its moving and what kind of situation theyre in these would largely be folks that got to the end of that forbearance period and we thought the appropriate thing to do the most conservative thing to do was to start to move them into nonaccrual and not continue down that forbearance path john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay and then it looks like your 90day past dues also increased about looks like more than in the quarter was that also related to hotels and then also maybe if you can comment on your office exposure and just how thats been holding up thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess ill start with the office exposure when we look at whats been happening in office the trends in rent collection have been pretty solid we havent seen a big decrease in what the our customers have been able to receive from the tenants and obviously a bunch of that is with the leases that are signed they tend to be longer term and oftentimes with larger corporations so its been pretty steady when i look at that space and i look at how many modifications there are in there that are outstanding its like of the portfolio and so overall the office space is doing very well again i would say the multifamily space is also holding up quite well and retail after our concerns early on were is also doing well mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 when you look at the over 90day to answer that question and whats going on the bulk of that is driven by the residential mortgage loans and the things that were buying out of the pools and theyre largely government guaranteed so its kind of the way theyre classified but not something that we worry about from a credit perspective john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning darren following up on comments that youve made on credit specifically the hotel credits that you moved to nonaccrual and are no longer applying forbearance can you just give a bigger picture view of what the trajectory is across the loan portfolio of downgrades and then along those lines is it reasonable to expect that we could see your reserve rate revert to the day one level of about on the other side of the pandemic and maybe you could just discuss how soon wed get there in light of some of the longer tail concerns that you guys have cited in cre in particular darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure so i guess just watching the trends and what weve been seeing over the course of the last i would describe it as six months when we were in june in the thick of things forbearance was quite widespread there was a it was across a number of industries and across quite a number of customers and whats happened over the course of the last six months is that weve seen stability and weve seen improvement i mean probably the most remarkable turnaround was in the dealer book that was if my memory is correct about billion of forbearance and all of those are off of forbearance and in fact all of those are current theyve not just theyre not just off forbearance but theyve recovered what they had skipped and when we look through the rest of the portfolio and what was in forbearance i think i mentioned that well first talking about criticized trends so weve been even though forbearance has been on we go through and we grade the book following our grading system and looking at our credit review process looking at cash flows looking at collateral looking at ability to repay intent to repay and grading the book and so what youre seeing is a slowdown in the migration to criticized right so we talked about that being up above this quarter and so the rate of increase in criticized is declining and the nonaccruals is really just that progression of people going from criticized into nonaccrual and whats really in the book is hotel theres a little bit of retail but retail has performed quite well and a little bit of multifamily and those are really the big three industries but hotel is far and away the largest one and whats interesting is when we look within the hotel portfolio its larger city hotels that are struggling mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 we have some hotels throughout our footprint that tend to be in less densely populated areas and perhaps are more like retreats or spas and through this pandemic theyre actually seeing occupancy rates north of and so theres a real range and skewness to occupancy rates within the hotel portfolio and so the part that i guess we feel good about is weve been able to help a lot of customers stay in business and stay paying and work them through the process and weve got a segment of the portfolio that still has some struggles but weve got very clear visibility into who those are and what the issues are and are in a position to be able to work with them as much as possible to help protect the value of the assets and to try and keep them in business the question about the portfolio and the longterm average i think its fair to say that going back to the pre the postcecl allowance or reserve rate subject to a similar mix of business is a fair assumption its important to keep in mind that some parts of the portfolio carry different loss rates under cecl than others and so all else equal thats a good place to be or at least a good starting point as you think forward do we get there in probably its a little hard to see that at this point but right now we think that thats possible by the end of i would think thats possible by the end of bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful color thank you if i could squeeze in another one and just broadly if you could discuss your thoughts around back book repricing dynamics for you guys and really across the industry in the last cycle loan yields continued to decline throughout the zirp cycle until we got our first rate hike in late and i was wondering if you could just discuss whether you expect to see a similar dynamic in this cycle darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes i guess a couple of things on the back book on the deposit side weve seen a tremendous amount of repricing and the reactivity in the deposit book for us and for the industry especially given all the excess liquidity has been very rapid and when we look at deposit pricing and yields certainly for a lot of the interestbearing categories excluding time deposits were getting close to the lows that we saw over the last years and so theres some room to go there but its single digit lowsingle digit basis points when you talk about loans and loan yields we think about it as loan margin and the yield is always of in reference to the benchmark rate because theres still variable rates different products but when you look at what the spread is on the new originations versus whats rolling off were actually seeing better spreads on new originations and weve been seeing that for the last two quarters and its in the range of call it basis points to basis points over where we had been prepandemic and so whats nice about that is obviously over time as the hedge benefit rolls off were starting to see well see a larger percentage of the book at the new pricing which is a little bit better than the rolloff pricing and so we actually were quite positive on that part of whats happening in the portfolio especially in the consumer or sorry commercial real estate and ci space bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 great i mean how does that better spreads on new originations compare to the last zirp cycle just to follow up on that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp its i guess i would say its reasonably consistent with what happens in the cycle and usually what you see is you see leading into the cycles you see margins drop because usually theres lots of liquidity and lots of capital lots of people looking for growth and then you will see margins compress when youre in that environment and then as you see a little challenge in the economy then you tend to see and people protecting capital you tend to see a little bit of an improvement in pricing because theres a little more pricing power obviously with the liquidity this time probably not quite as severe as last time and so there might not be the same level of increase in pricing but were certainly seeing it in the shortterm and i would say that that general trend in an economic environment like this and as you come out of it is actually pretty consistent with what you see bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you so much for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey darren good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning steven how are you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good how are you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp fine thank you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so the followup not to beat a dead horse on the hotel nonaccruals but i know you said there was no provision taken as you moved these into nonaccrual but were there any chargeoffs taken darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 there were no chargeoffs taken on that part of the portfolio if you look at the chargeoffs for the fourth quarter theres really three large relationships that really drove that increase two of them were what we would describe as enclosed malls and regional mall operators and by taking those chargeoffs that pretty much eliminates our outstanding exposure to enclosed malls and then there was one company thats described as delivery service highly related to the travel industry and with no travel going on that necessitated the chargeoff there outside of those it was a variety of things but generally relatively small compared to those three that i mentioned steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay darren in terms of what you do now with these hotel loans on nonaccrual i know you said theyre long term relationships are you planning to offer deferrals until maybe better days ahead do you plan to modify the principle to move them back to current or do you plan on going into the hotel business and taking the collateral over darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well not the latter the latter is always our last resort were bankers not hotel operators and so wed rather let the experts do that but its generally the first two things that you talked about so well work with the borrower and see whether we think that first question is do they have any outside liquidity and can they bring something to the table to in addition to the interest reserve it could be some combination of that plus some extended payment relief you could see some restructuring into something that looks more like an a note b note kind of structure where you split the credit and might have a partial chargeoff on those but not a complete and so theres a bunch of different options about of ways that we can work with the clients to try and keep them in business and keep them operating as long as possible because obviously us being in that business is absolutely the last resort steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and if i could squeeze one more in on dealer floor plan darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i think you said it was up million in the quarter what was the balance at yearend and can you talk about expectations for that business right it seems dealers have gone a lot more efficient with managing inventory levels during the pandemic so can you talk about what you expect from the business darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 yeah i guess when you look at the number of cars on lots we bottomed out and i want to say within the summer to early fall and inventories have been building since then theres a bunch of factors that go into the inventory that are sitting on the lots i mean not the least of which is what the car rental companies are doing with the challenges in travel theres been less demand for cars from that sector in the economy in the early part of this year as the manufacturer shut down there was tremendous demand from the dealers to put used cars on their lots and so they were buying up some of the inventory that was coming off of the rental agencies and so what we expect is that well see an uptick in inventories as we go through we dont believe well go all the way back to what we saw prepandemic or in that the saar wont go all the way back into that million million range but we will see some pick up and just i guess to give a little bit of sense of magnitude looking as that bounces from where we are at the end of the year to where we were at the end of the year last year theres roughly call it million to billion difference in whats outstanding at that point in time so how quickly we get back there i dont know that well get all the way back there in but we should be approaching that as we get to the end of the year assuming the economy continues to operate the way it was but we think theres still some room for that segment to show some growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc did i miss any comments on the outlook for the tax rate in darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp you did not miss that our expectation for the tax rate for next year is kind of plus or minus point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and are there opportunities to lower that like were seeing some other banks have these esg kind of partnerships i think some might be actually buying lowincome housing credits but some also seem to be doing some other things structure partnerships with customers or clients mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 and is that kind of another way to maybe deploy capital if theres not a lot of loans cant really dont want to grow securities and buying back stock after its doubled is maybe less appealing just theoretically so are there opportunities there or are you trying to just think differently of what you can do to your capital given everything i just said darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah lihtc is a part of the sector that weve always been in weve actually kind of increased it in the last to months its part of being a community bank that being in the community supporting those kinds of projects is critical we found that over time to be effective in that space you need to be not just on the loan but in the equity side of those deals as well and so weve been doing a little bit more of that and so its absolutely a part of how we do it its also an important part of your cre rating and so for all of those reasons thats absolutely a space that we have been in and will continue to be and as opportunities present themselves well certainly be there for the communities and for the clients matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then anything new specifically on some of these like esg initiatives that other banks seem to be kind of leaning into pretty heavily the reduced tax rates darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah weve done some of that were in the space we see opportunity for there to be a little bit more we havent discussed it because its not been a huge part of our portfolio and i guess one of the questions as we go forward is even with the tax rate where it is how much tax using capacity will there be with us making less money than we did a year ago but maybe therell be more capacity to use taxes depending on if theres any changes with the new administration so its a space that were familiar with and we do do some business in but its selective at the moment matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning hey darren just good to see that buyback announcement this morning i was just wondering if you can just walk us through the december stress test results and the implied scb that was brought forth in that document does it mean anything in terms of how you have to think about capital and does it lead you to think about participating in this years stress test process as a result thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 yeah so the ccar stress test results in december obviously reflected a much more severe economic environment than anything weve seen before and is meaningfully more severe than what the current environment looks like and so the good news is is were not operating in that environment that said we learned a lot from that output and we continue to work and talk with the federal reserve to understand a little bit more what is behind some of the outputs there so were using it to inform our thinking we havent as we go through that process and learn more from the fed that will help inform our decision about whether or not to participate in this years ccar i guess if you look at the implications of that and where we are at the end of the year the nice thing is when you look at where our cet1 ratio ended the year we ended the year at and so theres a comfortable amount of space between where we sit and what might be implied by the outcome of that test and with the restrictions that have been in place with capital sitting at we would feel given also the reserving that weve done that were well protected and that we certainly dont need to see the cet1 ratio drop dramatically to in the environment that were in today with the restrictions that wouldnt be possible but we equally dont see a need or a concern that we would want to run the capital ratios up materially from here and so as we think about those tests and we think about the feedback that came with them and we think about as we go forward well be taking that those things into account as we determine when and if and how much shares stock to repurchase operator and ladies and gentlemen we have time for one final question our final question will come from the line of erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes hi darren just a followup to kens question is that should we think about your dfast results with a spv is binding relative to how you think about the buybacks i guess i was under the impression that most banks were operating under the assumption that dfast results were sort of the binding results and dfast wasnt binding but im wondering especially relative to your 800million buyback announcements your thoughts there darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess i wouldnt consider that binding per se its obviously an input and an important one in our thought process because the federal reserve told us something with that and so were paying attention to it i think the by the letter of the law the feds indicated that they would not share with the institutions if that was to become a new scb until the end of march if not sooner and so well learn a little bit more about that over the course of the coming days and so until that point its our understanding that the scb that was calculated in the june results is the binding one that said when you look at the earnings and some of the restrictions on distributions relative to earnings in the forecast moving the cet1 ratio down meaningfully would be pretty difficult and so the announced buyback kind of takes into account our current capital position our forecasted earnings our forecasted balance sheet growth mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 and contemplate some of the restrictions that have been in place and that was really what got us to that amount at this point and as we mentioned before we think that were still not through the challenges of the pandemic and so we wouldnt see it doesnt seem prudent to us to lower those ratios dramatically but on the flip side we dont think that we need to be higher much higher than where we are and so well kind of manage to that in the short term and as we go through the year and see how the recovery unfolds well continue to update our thinking and share that with you erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and if i could just squeeze in one more question on the nii guide darren in the nii guide for down low to mid singledigits what are you assuming if any in terms of cash deployment relative to billion on average in the fourth quarter and if you could remind us what the swap income realized in versus whats embedded in your for darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so within that projection there is some expectation that the cash balances come down a little bit and generally its the volatility in the cash balances as opposed to them going into higher yielding securities or loan growth and so i guess embedded in that guide is still a relatively elevated cash position so to the extent that we find ways to deploy that into higher yielding assets which were always on the lookout for theres some upside to that when you look at the income from the hedge portfolio what we earned this quarter was very similar to what we earned last quarter in terms of nii and what we should see in  is also in line with that and then it starts to decline as weve talked about on prior calls over the course of theres still some benefit in from the hedges but its declining as we go through the year erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay and could you care to quantify in dollars darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp ive got it in front of me by quarter so im just looking at it it was around million in and drops to about million in erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you so much operator and that was our final question id like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks mt bank corp
