moodys msci and sustainalytics turning to slide there are several successes to highlight this quarter we continue to see growth in auto dealerships as well as specialty businesses we continue to grow customer deposits despite increasing competition and building on the strong liquidity position and comparative strength of our financial position in the industry allows us to continue lending in support of communities and local businesses we remain focused on diligently managing expenses our third quarter results continue to reflect the strength of our core earnings power third quarter revenues have grown compared to last years third quarter pre provision net revenues have increased to billion credit remained stable net chargeoffs decreased in mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 the third quarter and yeartodate we still remain below the historical longterm average gaap net income for the quarter was million up versus linked quarter in diluted gaap earnings per share was for the third quarter up from last years similar quarter now lets review our net operating results for the quarter on slide mts net operating income for the third quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million and diluted net operating earnings per share was net operating return on tangible common equity was and tangible book value per share increased compared to the end of june on slide you will see that diluted gaap earnings per share was down from linked quarter recall the results from the second quarter of last year indicated an aftertax million gain from the sale of the cit business in april excluding this gain gaap net income and diluted earnings per share were down compared to the linked quarter on a gaap basis mts third quarter results produced an roa and roe of and respectively next we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated the third quarter results please turn to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in the third quarter down million from the linked quarter this decline was driven largely by higher interest rates on consumer deposit funding an unfavorable funding mix change partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets and one additional day the net interest margin for the past quarter was down basis points from linked quarter the primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift which reduced margin by basis points the net impact from higher interest rates on customer deposits net benefit from higher rates on earning assets which we estimate reduced the margin by basis points the remaining basis point was due to higher non accrual interest net of the impact of one additional day turning to slide average earning assets increased billion from the linked quarter due largely to the strong deposit growth that drove the billion growth at the fed average loans declined million and average investment securities declined million turning to slide to talk about average loans total loans and leases averaged billion for the third quarter of down compared to the linked quarter looking at loans by category on average basis compared to the second quarter ci loans increased slightly to billion we continue to see growth in dealer and specialty businesses during the third quarter average cre loans decreased by to billion this decline was driven largely by our continued strategy to reduce onbalance sheet exposure to this asset class we have chosen to modernize our suite of products and services to offer more alternatives to better serve customers and to do so in a more capitalefficient manner possible average residential real estate was billion down largely due to portfolio paydowns average customer loans were down slightly to billion the decline was driven by lower auto loan and heloc balances partially offset by the growth in recreational finance and credit card loans turning to slide average investment securities decreased to billion during the third quarter the duration of the investment securities book at the end of september was years and the unrealized pretax availablefor mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 sale portfolio was only million at the end of the third quarter cash held at the fed and investment securities totaled billion representing of total assets turning to slide we continue to focus on growing deposits with our customers and were pleased with the growth in both average and endofperiod customer deposits average total deposits grew billion however consistent with our experience in prior rising rate environments increased competition for deposits and customer behavior continues the mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits average customer deposits increased billion the customer deposit mix to migrate to average demand deposits declined billion in favor of commercial sweeps and customer money market savings and time deposits average brokered deposits increased billion sic 23billion while federal home loan bank advances decreased billion on average brokered money market and now increased million brokered time increased billion brokered deposits represent just one of the several funding vehicles that we can employ in our management of the balance sheet at september of this year brokered deposits represented of our outstanding deposits and shortterm borrowings the pace and reduction in demand deposits seem to have decreased during the quarter our determined focus on retaining and growing customer deposits yielded positive results during the quarter next lets discuss noninterest income please turn to slide noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter compared to million in the linked quarter as noted earlier the second quarter included million from the sale of the cit business excluding this gain third quarter noninterest income decreased million compared to the second quarter driven predominantly by million related to one month of the cit trust revenues included in the previous quarter other revenues categories were largely unchanged from the linked quarter turning to slide for expenses noninterest expenses were billion in the third quarter of this year down million from the linked quarter that decrease in expense was due to million in lower compensation and benefit costs reflecting lower average head count lower expenses for contracted resources and overtime million lower in other cost of operations largely reflecting lower subadvisory fees as a result of the sale of the cit business lower legalrelated expenses partially offset by losses associated with certain retail banking activities the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and security gains or losses from a denominator was in the recent quarter compared to in the linked quarter after excluding the gain from the sale of the cit business next lets turn to slide for credit the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the third quarter up million from the end of the linked quarter in the third quarter we recorded a million provision in credit losses which was equal to the second quarter net chargeoffs were million in the third quarter compared to million in the linked quarter the reserve build was primarily reflective of softening cre values and the variability in the timing and the amount of cre chargeoffs at the end the third quarter non accrual loans were billion a decrease of million compared to the prior quarter and represent of loans down basis points sequentially as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million significant chargeoffs were tied in four large credits three large office buildings in washington dc boston and connecticut and one large healthcare provider operating in multiple properties in western new york and pennsylvania mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the third quarter compared to basis points in the second quarter this brings our yeartodate net chargeoff rate to basis points which is below our longterm average of basis points we continue to assess the impact on future maturities and our investor real estate portfolio due to the level of interest rates the impact of value declines and the emerging tenancy issues continued targeted deep portfolio dives in office healthcare and multifamily portfolios are being done to identify any new emerging issues when we file our upcoming form 10q in the few weeks we will estimate the level of criticized loans will be up to midtohigh singledigit percent as compared to the end of june largely due to increases in investor real estate reflective of the financial strength and portfolio diversification of the cre borrowers almost of the criticized loans are paying as agreed loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of this quarter compared to million million sequentially and total of these days past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to slide for capital mts cit ratio at the end of september was an estimated compared to at the end of the second quarter the increase was due in part to the continuation of the pause of repurchasing shares at the end of september based upon the proposed capital rules the negative aoci impact on the cet1 ratio from the availableforsale securities and pensionrelated components would be approximately basis points now turning to slide for outlook with three quarters in the books we will focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter first lets talk about the economic outlook the economic environment was supportive in the third quarter and we were cautiously optimistic heading into the last quarter of this year in the third quarter the overall economy continued to expand thanks to the strong consumer spending and steady capital expenditures by businesses though the housing market continues to struggle in the high rate environment encouragingly inflation continued to slow in labor markets while still tight improved substantially with steady hiring while age pressures dissipated looking ahead to the fourth quarter we are cautiously optimistic that the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate we expect that that slower growth will continue reducing inflation pressures the federal reserve has probably reached the end of its hike cycle given slower inflation and recent runup in longterm rates with that economic backdrop lets review our net interest income outlook we expect taxable equivalent net interest income to be in the billion to billion range as we noted on the previous calls a key driver to net interest income continues to be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth we expect the continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industrywide outflows we remain focused on growing customer deposits for the fourth quarter we expect average deposits to be about the same level with growth of interestbearing customer deposits but continue to decline in demand deposit balances this is expected to translate into a throughthecycle interestbearing customer deposit beta through the fourth quarter this year to be in the mid40 range this deposit beta excludes brokered deposits including brokered deposits mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 would add to the beta while the percent of the cumulative beta is slowing we anticipate it will continue rising into the first half of next year next lets discuss the outlook for the average loan growth which should be the main driver of earning asset growth we expect average loans and lease balances to be slightly higher than the third quarter of billion level we expect the growth in ci but anticipate declines in cre and residential mortgages while consumer loan balances should be relatively flat turning to fees we expect noninterest income to be essentially flat compared to the third quarter turning to expenses we anticipate expenses excluding intangible amortization and the fdic special assessment to be in the billion to the billion range in the fourth quarter intangible amortization is expected to be in the million range and fdic special assessment is anticipated to be million given the prospects of slowing revenue growth we remain focused on diligently managing expenses turning to credit we continue to expect loan losses for the full year to be near mts longterm average of basis points which implies fourth quarter chargeoffs could be higher than the third quarter for the fourth quarter we expect taxableequivalent tax rate to be in the range finally as it relates to capital our capital coupled with limited investment security marks have been a clear differentiator for mt mt has proven to be a safe haven for clients and communities the strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary we take our responsibility to manage our shareholders capital very seriously and we will return capital when it is appropriate to do that our businesses are performing very well and we are growing new relationships each and every day we are still evaluating the proposed capital rules so that we believe that now is not the time to be purchasing shares that said we are positioned to use our capital for organic growth buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future in the meantime our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us from our clients communities regulators investors and rating agencies to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis while economic uncertainty remains high that is when mt has historically outperformed its peers mt has always been a purposedriven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholders we have a long track record of credit outperforming through an all economic cycles with growth about two times that of peers our strong shareholder returns include to return on tangible common equity and robust dividend growth finally our disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of capital shareholder capital and our integration of peoples merger is completed we are confident in our ability to realize our potential postmerger now with that ill turn it back to our caller wholl briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc you spoke about a mid to high singledigit increase in criticized loans this quarter i was wondering how is the mix changing between hotel healthcare and office and it also looks like nonaccrual loans dipped lower this quarter so can you talk about what the drivers are there whether theres loan sales or any other underlying drivers and if that had any benefit to net interest income this quarter daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah happy to do that so on the criticized increase its really just more of the same that were seeing its more increases just in our ire portfolio primarily on the office side for the most part so nothing really different from trends that were seeing as far as nonaccruals there was one large property that was sold in new york that was a primary driver for the nonaccruals we actually had a gain in that that helped margin probably by about million in the quarter manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you and then maybe just on the buybacks what is the criteria to resume the buybacks from here because it seems like we have more clarity on regulation at this point is it a function of mt issuing more in the debt markets and then starting buybacks is it to do with the credit rating agencies any color you can throw there would be helpful especially given how much excess capital mts have at this point daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so i definitely agree with you manan in that we do have excess capital but right now the economy is still kind of unpredictable rates higher for long will probably continue to have stress on clients over the next couple of quarters if that actually comes to fruition i think were just trying to be conservative and cautious at the same time and its also for us to actually have an opportunity to continue to grow organic growth in our commercial and consumer books and our trust books as well mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 so i think were just trying to be cautious and we know when the economy gets a little bit more comfortable well consider repurchases there it is true to our long form strategy the capital distribution back to the shareholders its not going anywhere but we just want to continue to make sure that were strong and can grow and serve our customers right now manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp thank you operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just want to followup daryl in terms of so your nii guide for the fourth quarter is fairly clear but we are hearing from some of your peers around potential for the margin nii bottoming in the fourth quarter especially if the fed is done give us your thought process around is there something about your balance sheet why that might get pushed out because of deposits have been related to the price or the dynamics on your balance sheet or your markets any color there would be appreciated daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah manan its really the biggest driver for the net interest margin for us right now is really what happens to our noninterestbearing deposits we were down billion that was better than what we thought it would be and we think that its slowing down well see how that plays out in the fourth quarter but that is probably the biggest determining factor when you look at our balance sheet though im actually pretty pleased with how the assets are repricing if you look at the reactivity rate on some of our fixed portfolios if you look at this quarter like our consumer loan portfolio was up basis points we have home equity in there that is prime related but thats a smaller percentage we have really good repricing in other consumer portfolios like auto was up approximately basis points in what was rolling off versus what was rolling on if you look at our rv and boat portfolio that was up approximately basis points of what was rolling off rolling on so i think once we get more stability in the disintermediation of deposits im more favorable into margin stabilizing i think the asset side is actually performing pretty well mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess just moving maybe give us a marktomarket in terms of commercial real estate what youre seeing around theres some concern whether if we go into next year given what the yield curves done we might see some more pressure flow beyond cre office into multifamily so one give us a sense of like on the cre office has the visibility improved around the level of marks that you might have to take as some of this works through the system and whether or not youre seeing more pain beyond the office complex daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so on the office side i would tell you our credit team we feel really on top of whats going on there i think we are actively looking at any credit that could be and have any issues whatsoever were looking at it im trying to put the right valuation in there we traditionally run with a higher level of criticized assets because we have a lot of longterm clients that have been with mt for a long time period they have other sources of cash flow to help carry the loans and are willing to put in equity to help support the loans when we do find loans that there is not support around well probably move to exit those as far as the valuations go theres still not a whole lot of specifics out there we did have that one sale for us that actually was a little bit better than what we had it marked there but that was one big loan so i wouldnt say thats a trend by any stretch right now but i think we feel pretty good on where we are as far as the other asset classes i think we just with rates higher for longer just puts more just tougher for some of the customers and multifamily is an area that we are looking at as well nothing really is popping out of anything very severe there yet but were just trying to stay ahead of what potentially could happen and kind of be preemptive if we see anything so were just preparing our credit team is very experienced weve been very good with commercial real estate for a long time and we are on top of where we are ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator the next question comes from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just wanted to clarify sort of the responses to ebrahims question daryl im just wondering as you think about the forward curve as we see it at what point do you expect net interest income to trough based on what we know about the curve and what we know about the various puts and takes for growth and deposit actions daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah from a framework perspective its really when the disintermediation slows down i think when disintermediation slows down i think the asset side is performing well and will continue to reprice higher because i think were going to have a steeper curve for a longer period of time mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 and hopefully that will happen in the next couple of quarters but its really hard to know right now we think its slowing but i think well just see how that plays out ill give you guidance next earnings call on the fourth quarter on that but conditions could be slowing down with what were seeing right now but one quarter is not a trend i just want to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we really say net interest margin is going to stabilize erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and as a followup to that your periodend cash balance rose to billion daryl which is awesome dry powder and as we think about the quarters ahead on one hand potentially there the fed is peaking right and you seem to be rather asset sensitive on the other you have all these new rules on liquidity that we dont have yet as well as treatment of afs for regional banks so how should we think about an absence of stronger net loan growth the puts and takes of what youre are you just going to continue to build cash and be a little bit more asset sensitive even though were peaking in rates as we figure out what the final rules look like on both capital and liquidity daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp i think we have the strong position at the fed thats intentional for us right now we want to be really conservative with our cash and liquidity position like i said earlier the economy is doing okay but slowing down and maybe hopefully not get into a recession but we just want to be really careful and cautious from that perspective so i think its an intentional where were staying there will we invest some of that obviously into loans we would love to do that to support our customers but we are not widening our credit box whatsoever were going to grow what the market will give us but we do think theres opportunities to grow relationships and to potentially grow balances in some of our loan categories so well see how that plays out as far as deploying some of it the cash into the securities portfolio i would just say that over the next year you might see us move a little bit to the investment portfolio but it will be on a gradual basis erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning first sorry if i missed it but did you comment on what your reserves are against your office book daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp so we havent made that probably matt but it continues to increase where we are right now so we had an increase in our allowance we had a little over million id say about half of it went to the cre portfolio and half of it went to the ci portfolio so i think we were adding it where we think its appropriate based upon our models and performance mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay yeah that would be helpful to get over time i know everybodys book is a little bit different but many of your peers are disclosing so that would be helpful as you think about disclosures obviously an area of focus maybe switching gears like as you think about all the capital that have and liquidity and the balance sheet flexibility what areas of lending are you leaning into not just kind of looking out one quarter but the next few quarters and is it kind of doing more business with existing customers or also trying to grow the customer footprint daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp i mean this past quarter we had growth in our dealership businesses as the strike was starting to happen i think a lot of dealers actually stocked up on used cars and that actually drove an increase in utilization in that one sector a little bit earlier than normal there that will probably continue to play out i think into the fourth quarter while would be one our large corporate banking i think has some growth opportunities where were positioned there specifically on fund banking i think were growing there nicely its a very conservative portfolio very shortterm oriented lower risk areas so i would say most of the growth that were seeing is in the ci space those are the highlights right now it is very competitive in middle market ci we are trying to be competitive there but right now the higher interest rates are just putting a lot of our commercial clients to be a little bit more cautious but when theyre willing to borrow were trying to help them when thats when were able to do that so matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator the next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning hey daryl i wanted to followup on your comments around higherforlonger rate environment being tougher for your customers as you look across your portfolio do you have a good handle on the degree to which some of your customers had put on swaps maybe when we were still under indiscernible two to three years ago so they havent yet felt the pressure of higher rates curious about whether the rolling off of those swaps is something you worry about not really not just in cre but really across all loan categories daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think obviously bill i mean people that did swaps three years ago are really fortunate that they did but it depends on the maturities when they rolloff and when they do rolloff it does put pressure on some clients that basically just have higher interest payments there so that is impacting much broader than just office broader than just cre its impacting i think all of america right now to be honest with you i mean just higher rates for longer i think the fed wants to slow the economy down and were definitely having that impact to do that and theyre accomplishing what achieving there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 but we like i said earlier we are on top of the portfolios where we see maturities coming up were looking at what we have to do if anything do they have other support on it so were trying to stay ahead of whats coming down the pike most of the maturities and swap are lined together so that theyre pretty much in balance so when things come close to mature on loans is when we see if theres anything that needs to happen from a lending perspective but i think the fed is accomplishing what theyre trying to do is slow the economy down bring inflation down and its definitely have a net impact bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful daryl thank you if i could followup as you continue to take actions to shift more of your focus to fee income as you reduce the credit risk associated with onbalance sheet cre how are you thinking about your sort of longer term cet1 target before i guess all the developments of the last several quarters were sort of thinking of mt being able to get to sort of that cet1 target but i guess the inclusion of oci volatility and regulatory capital has led to some debate over whether category banks will now have to run with a little bit larger buffer versus history would appreciate any thoughts there daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think as the new rules play out and as we get comfortable working within the rules you obviously start with a higher cushion at first and then as you get used to managing the book and everything i think we will tighten it up over time but my guess is that we probably have a higher buffer coming out of the blocks you have to really adjust your investment portfolio since the afs is going to now go through the regulatory capital ratios to probably run with shorter durations either outright or invest longer with hedges that bring in the durations one way or the other just so you have less volatility there so its really just getting used to how we manage all that process but our teams are working on that now and we will start operating that way probably well before we get the rules actually implemented from that perspective bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp thanks bill operator the next question comes from brent erensel with portales partners please go ahead brent erensel q analyst portales partners i was going to followup on that stock buyback question thank you and good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 good morning brent erensel q analyst portales partners indiscernible if you were to like incrementally invest the capital that youre generating at you would generate half the returns that you could by buying back stock so you need doubledigit returns to equate that if that question makes sense so the question i guess is when at what point will the corporate finance math drive you to resume buybacks daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp so the corporate finance math is screaming that its a buy right now its really more of our cautious position conservative nature that we have to make sure that we have really strong capital strong liquidity to really weather what comes our way i mean if the fed stays higher rates lets say for three years or whatever that could really have a big impact on the economy we just want to be really cautious and all that so i think were just trying to be prudent with it like i said earlier the capital is not going anywhere we wont i promise you we would deploy it in a really shareholderfriendly manner from that but right now we have strong capital strong liquidity which has been really helpful for us since the marchapril timeframe and we will continue to operate and be a strong supporter of our customers and communities that we serve brent erensel q analyst portales partners just is there a bell thats going to go off when you guys are going to change your mind or how should we do we just wait and see daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp i will tell you once we make that decision to go my guess is you will find out very quickly when that decision is made brent erensel q analyst portales partners thank you operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp hi gerard mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc daryl over the years mt has been very effective in making acquisitions obviously the peoples deal is the more recent acquisition that is now completely integrated and we understand in talking to your peers and others that the interest rate marks make it very difficult for ma today so i got a twopart question for you first just what is your view on ma for mt over the next to months of traditional depositories and then second some of the pc in particular was recently bought some assets from the fda i see some loans are you guys looking at any assets that might be for sale from the fdic from the failed banks that we had earlier in this year daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so we didnt do a press release on it but we did buy two loans from that same purchase pc did i think it was a total of about million in commitments it was at fund banking so we did participate in there and were able to get a couple of those loans as well but we are constantly looking where we can grow our customer base that are good longterm customers that fit we just dont want to do asset purchases we want relationships is really what were looking for to drive our organic growth from that as it relates to acquisitions its just you and i have been doing this for a long time when i started we had banks in the early now were up to about banks and its going to continue to shrink i think mt has a great track record of acquiring bank over time and that strategy hasnt changed our strategy is really to control and have lots of density in the markets that we serve so i think if and when we do purchase acquisitions it probably wont be a surprise in where were going and what were trying to do from that perspective so the strategy is there and it will happen at some point down the road the interest rates definitely make it a little bit more challenging now just because the impact on capital but like anything things change over time and we will be there when we need to and do what weve been really good at before and well continue to do that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then the second part a different question as a followup when mt of course has developed a reputation as being a very strong underwriter you got the numbers to prove it and so were not necessarily concerned about what you guys are doing specifically but we always worry about the competitors doing foolish and stupid things that then end up having a second derivative effect on your sound underwriting decisions can you frame out for us granted i know its not and craziness out there but are there any concerns that you see nonbank lenders or other bank lenders doing or have done things in the last to months on the lending side that make you a little nervous or are we just in a new playing field everybody is very rational and were not going to see anything really implode because of what some foolish lenders are doing daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah we have a long history of working with our clients client selection is really huge for us and how we look and underwrite so like in the cre portfolio we deal with people that have been in the business for a very long time that arent just looking at that real estate investment that they have as an investment for more as a longterm strategy to their company and their family from that perspective so i really dont look at trying to get out of the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 criticized loans if somebody is not going to support it we will probably exit over time but i dont really view how we are approaching that i think its a great way to develop and keep relationships over the long term its the right way and a fair way to do it as long as theyre willing to support their properties and loans with us from that perspective i think overall though i think the industry is much safer than what it has been over the last couple of decades i think everybody is trying to do the right thing we have the benefit that we have some really longterm customers that have been with mt for a long period of time and we try to bank the people that are really top in market in all the markets that we serve gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate the color thank you operator the next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc just a followup around the loan loss reserve i know you had talked about the that the reserve addition was for cre and half going to ci and im just trying to frame out like what about the developments in the quarter drove the need for additional reserve additions beyond what would have already been baked into there under cecl and then separately can you maybe talk about the likelihood of further reserve build here just as you continue to dig through the cre portfolio i know you said a couple of times that theres ongoing efforts to sift through the exposures in that book daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so if you look at the macro factors our macro factors when we run our allowance models basically were pretty steady actually the indiscernible actually improved a little bit but the other economic statistics were pretty stable versus the prior period really what drove the increase was really softness in some of the asset values in the cre portfolio is what we were seeing and thought it made sense to add some more reserves in those as we get more examples of what valuations are that could help drive more or may actually i think we feel really reserved where we are today but we just want to continue to have a really robust allowance for the needs of our mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 borrowers and make sure we comply with all the rules we have there but it was really just a little bit of softness in some valuations john pancari q analyst evercore group llc and is that softness surprisingly negatively and its why its not already in the cecl reserve daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp theres just not a lot of activity going on in some of these markets right now so youre basically theres a big market dislocation a lot of the marks were doing as conservative as they are with a net present value cash flow perspective and we i think i went through it last time but if something is not leased today we assume its not leased for three years if something is coming off lease within the next year we assume that theres a oneyear gap period before it gets released those type of cash flow adjustments are kind of what were marking to but we dont have anything to look at but when you get a certain example i would say then we can make an adjustment our best sell right now is that theres a lot of money waiting on the sidelines potentially that when the fed does decide to keep rates more stable and maybe signal rates going down at some point i think there will be a lot of money that will jump back into the system right now theres just not a lot of going on and theres a very wide bidask spread john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thats helpful thanks for that one last followup if i could also on credit your i know your chargeoff guidance for the fourth quarter you expect it to be a low above the basis point level for the third quarter and then full year near the longterm bps can you maybe help us think about what that would imply in terms of as you look into maybe help us i know youre not giving formal guidance yet on but how should we think about where the loss trajectory could be versus that longerterm how much above that could it be daryl n bible a chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thats a good question for the fourth quarter it is just our gut feel that it might be higher it could actually be the same or lower to be honest with you right now but just knowing whats going on right there it might be higher but we really arent sure about that yet next year we arent really giving guidance but from a framework perspective our allowance will build when either market economic conditions allow for it or you see some deterioration in customer behavior from that perspective but right now i think were really on top of what it is any areas that we potentially could have risk in our credit teams are all over it looking at the reviews and the analysis that we have and right now we feel that our reserve is adequate and then were in good touch with where the risks are john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks daryl appreciate it operator it appears we have no further
