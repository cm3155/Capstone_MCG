controller whom im sure you both know you know both of them as we noted in this mornings press release were pleased with the strong momentum in residential mortgage banking and our wilmington trust group of businesses outside of our usual seasonal first quarter surge in salaries and benefits expenses remained well controlled and credit trends are indicative of the state of the loan portfolio and the forecasted improvements in the economy diluted gaap earnings per common share was for the first quarter of compared with in the fourth quarter of and in last years first quarter net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linkedquarter and million in the yearago quarter on a gaap basis mts first mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter also included in the quarters results were mergerrelated charges of million related to mts proposed acquisition of peoples united financial this amounted to million aftertax or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions net operating income for the first quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million compared with million in the linkedquarter and million in last years first quarter diluted net operating earnings per share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2020s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of last year net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible asset and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the sec guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity so lets take a look at some of the underlying details taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the first quarter of compared with million in the linkedquarter this reflects a higher level of average interest earnings assets primarily cash equivalents and a shorter calendar quarter the margin for the past quarter was down basis points from in the linkedquarter the primary driver of the margin decline was the higher level of cash on deposit with the federal reserve which we estimated reduced the margin by basis points and that was partially offset by a 2basispoint benefit from the shorter quarter similarly the million linkedquarter decline in net interest income reflects the loss of income from two fewer accrual days changes in interest rates had a minimal effect for the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of average interest earnings assets increased by some reflecting a increase in money market placements including cash on deposit with the federal reserve and an decline in investment securities average loans outstanding grew nearly compared with the previous quarter excluding ppp loans average loans grew billion or over looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the linkedquarter commercial and industrial loans were essentially flat with increased dealer floor plan balances and other ci loans partially offset by lower average ppp loans due to timing of originations and the receipt of payments average ppp loans declined million from the prior quarter commercial real estate loans declined less than compared to the fourth quarter indicative of very low levels of customer activity residential real estate loans grew by consistent with our expectations the increase reflects purchases of loans from ginnie mae pools that we subservice partially offset by further runoff of the acquired mortgage loans mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 consumer loans were up nearly that activity was consistent with recent quarters where growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans on an endof period basis ppp loans totaled billion up from billion at the end of the fourth quarter average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman island office and cds over increased or billion compared to the fourth quarter that figure includes billion of noninterestbearing deposits on an endofperiod basis core deposits were up nearly billion foreign office deposits decreased on an average basis but were essentially flat on an endofperiod basis turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million for the first quarter compared with million in the linkedquarter the recent quarter included million of valuation losses on equity securities largely the remaining holdings of our gse preferred stock while 2020s final quarter included million of gains over the past few years mt has received a distribution from bayview lending group in the first quarter of the year results for the first quarter of included a million distribution and a change in the past timing as you may know mt received a million distribution in the fourth quarter of as expected no distribution was received in this years first quarter mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter down million from million in the linkedquarter our residential mortgage business continue to perform well revenues from that business including both originations and servicing activities were million in the first quarter improved from million in the prior quarter that increase reflects improved gain on sale margins residential mortgage loans originated for sale were billion in the recent quarter up about from the fourth quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the first quarter reflecting a seasonal decline from million in the linkedquarter that figure was million in the yearago quarter trust income rose to million in the recent quarter improved from million in the previous quarter the increase is the result of growth in assets under management in wealth and institutional businesses service charges on deposits were million compared with million in the fourth quarter the decline from the linked quarter is the result of higher customer balances offsetting activitybased fees turning to operating expenses for the first quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses were million the comparable figures were million in the linkedquarter and million in the yearago quarter as is typical for mts fiscal first quarter results operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirementeligible employees the hsa contribution the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401k match and fica payments and unemployment insurance those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million in last years first quarter as usual we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter other cost of operations for the past quarter included a million reduction in the valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights youll recall that there was a million addition to the allowance in 2020s fourth quarter and a million addition in last years first quarter the quarters results also reflect an elevated contribution to the mt charitable foundation mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2020s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of those ratios in the first quarters of and each reflect the seasonally elevated compensation expenses that we talked about next lets turn to credit the overall economy of course continues to improve but some sectors such as hospitality continue to face the pressure as was the case over the course of the recent quarter continued to highlight the differences between the former incurred loss accounting method and the cecl standard adopted at the beginning of last year previously reported delinquencies and transition of loans from accruing to nonaccruing status evidenced by financial stress delinquencies or default by borrowers preceded or accompanied the establishment of loss reserves under cecl we increased our loss reserves last year based on worsening projected economic scenarios significant downgrades of specifically identifiable credits to nonaccrual emerged in the fourth quarter and to criticize in the recent quarter consistent with last years additions to the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the first quarter the million decline from the end of reflects a million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses combined with million of net chargeoffs in the first quarter the provision recapture and the resulting reduction in the allowance for the recent quarter continue to reflect the ongoing uncertainty as to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic activity employment levels and the ultimate collectibility of loans that said the improving economic outlook leaves us cautiously optimistic as to the ongoing effects of the pandemic compared with the greater levels of uncertainty in prior quarters our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes that the national unemployment rate continues to be at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual improvement reaching by the end of the forecast assumes that gdp grows at annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to pre pandemic levels during our forecast considers improved government stimulus but not any further fiscal or monetary actions nonaccrual loans amounted to billion or of loans at the end of march this was up slightly from at the end of last december as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the first quarter compared with basis points in the fourth quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were billion at the end of the recent quarter of those loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the fourth quarter and which reflects a slight reduction in riskweighted assets and earnings net of dividends as previously noted the peoples united merger is pending we dont plan to engage in any stock repurchases activity while that is pending now turning to the outlook while the economy continues to improve and funds from stimulus programs reach our commercial and consumer clients we havent seen enough change in our outlook for in any significant way from what we shared on the january call aside from the improved credit outlook as evidenced by the reserve release this quarter i dont intend to provide any updates mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 darrens remarks as to net interest income loan growth fees and expenses still hold and those of course predate our merger announcement and dont contemplate any impact from the merger we supply the merger related comments at the time of announcement of course as youre aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future so now lets open up the call to questions before which maria will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hi ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey rené its like you never left in terms of given the prepared remarks all right maybe just to startoff in terms of the reserve release the way the press release read and even your comments it sounds like you guys are still applying a fair amount of qualitative overlays that are fairly negative that youre theres a lot of uncertainty in the market but you still released reserves pretty meaningfully this quarter is it fair to assume that if the economy continues to get slowly better and some of those qualitative overlays come off that we could actually see a more material negative provision expense next quarter rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp i guess the way id think about it is if you look at how our allowance worked at the end of the quarter we saw releases in the commercial ci book and in the consumer book and those are largely reflective of the gdp and unemployment projection improvements that youve seen and i think the thing to think about as you know that one of the unique things about this period of time is that its uneven right so while were having good projections unemployments coming down weve got great projections of gdp its not even everywhere and so some of the places that are affected by travel and entertainment right are still lagging behind so while weve seen things for example like higher scheduled bookings for the summer and the fall weve really yet to see the improvement particularly in our cre and our hotel exposures so without using the word overlay i think that were looking for signs of improvement in those particular areas which would be required before we would see any reduction in the reserves on those portfolios mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that makes sense and then just as a followup question youre obviously building up a fairly sizable cash position given all the deposit growth how are you thinking about investing some of that cash into higheryielding securities potentially rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp its a great question we give a lot of thought i think our first thought it starts with the idea that we probably at the end of the quarter probably had billion of excess liquidity beyond what we would use and use for our liquidity position and i think a huge portion of that is clearly related to what i would call transitory now the big issue is how long is the transition and so when we first thought that we had is that we hate to invest in lowreturn assets so we dont think its our job to invest for you all of that cash and securities because you could go do that off on your own the returns are too low having said that we do have one of the smallest securities book out there and so were sort of constantly monitoring this idea of how low do we want to make that go so i think maybe the more interesting thing longterm is whats really hard to see is the growth in activity that may be permanent thats happening over time the account growth those types of things and the behavior of customers so i think when we do see which may not be for a while because of more infrastructure spending and things like that but when we do see a return i think we may see a higher level of cash balances for quite some time and as that becomes more clear to us we would think of investing those dollars but i think its a little too early today ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc hello rené rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hey john pancari q analyst evercore group llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 i just wanted to maybe touch on loan demand if you can talk a little bit about where youre seeing any improvement at all particularly on the commercial side really interested in what youre seeing on the pipeline front and are you seeing any signs of a pickup in capex activity and then separately on the consumer side as well what youre seeing thanks a lot rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah so in the ci space i think i dont know if its a change but if you look in the areas of ma activity if you look in the areas of manufacturing weve seen some progress there but beyond that its very slow utilization was either flat to slightly down this quarter were seeing very limited if any growth really declines in the cre segment because theres just no demand because of the state of things there having said that its interesting particularly commercial volumes remain low if you look back as i did over four five quarters you do see a steady increase in the roll on margin so the activity that is getting done is at higher return levels so that should have some impact as we move further not immediate impact but as that continues that should have some positive impact on the margin things still remain really robust on the consumer side with the exception of heloc loans john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks thats helpful and then separately on the credit quality side wondering if you could update us on the commercial real estate portfolio i know you indicated the areas of stress by industry but i know you also noted that there wasnt necessarily a release there on the commercial real estate side so if you can just remind us the size of that reserve as well when you gave the update on the trends thanks rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah so what ill say is no surprise hotels continue to be the property type that are under the greatest amount of stress in our portfolio and hotel cre loans were the largest contributor to the increase in our criticized book and the thing to think about it is given the duration of the pandemic and its impact on things like travel its really not surprising that the hotels kind of face greater stress so youll remember that although performance were seeing some slight improvement give me one second weve seen some slight improvement most of our hotel portfolios really cant support the contractual debt service payments without an inplace modification or maybe as important support from their sponsors so what that means is that while youve seen an increase in classifieds so this quarter weve seen about billion increase in our classifieds about half of that was in the hotel space really what that is is just the length of time having said that we dont expect that those downgrades will contribute to increased risk of loss because that really depends on other factors like beyond the credit grade like the strength of the sponsors and the value of the underlying collateral youll notice that we didnt have much of an increase to nonperformance for example in terms of those two factors the strength of our collateral first what weve been doing is weve been on a mission to reappraise all of our hospitality properties that are in excess of million and that are in the classified status so that reflects a little over properties and that accounts for about billion in exposure so the first of those appraisals so far through february have shown asis values that have declined about and stabilized values that reflect about a decline keep that in mind that were starting with ltv mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 and then if you jump to new york city weve seen a asis decline with a stabilized decline but that starts with an ltv above right so that gives you a sense that the migration were seeing in classifieds in this space is pretty normal of what we would have expected but its not necessarily an indication of loss content and then finally the last thing id say is in talking to all of our sponsors they seem to remain strong and capable of supporting the properties until conditions improve and we really have a low number of properties maybe something like that come due this year and a significant portion that are and beyond in excess of that are further out so we think were in a good position to kind of watch this stuff change i dont know if i have the numbers on the specific reserve for you john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah no problem i can get that later on rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp okay okay great john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thanks rené appreciate it rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of dave rochester of compass point dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp good morning dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i know you mentioned no updates on the guidance front for but the interest rate backdrop does look a little bit better today versus a few months ago so i was just wondering if you can talk about how youre factoring that in i know youd mentioned nii down maybe in the low to midsingledigit range for the year at that point so i was just curious what the offsets might be there if its weaker loan growth or some other area or maybe youre thinking that range is still good but maybe its the better end of that range is more likely just any color there would be great mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah no its good question i think were looking at low singledigit yearoveryear change in the margin decline in the margin but i would say that were off to a good start if you think about how do you outperform that your first quarter is probably the toughest because you were on a declining trend and so were excited that we actually outperformed there and i think the things that were not sure how long they last but things like the extended foreclosure moratorium means that well be doing less repooling of the ginnie mae it means theyll be on the balance sheet longer right so that will produce some results and then the cash balances are relatively high so id just say we feel good and optimistic about at the least meeting our projections dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then maybe just switching to the loan growth front you mentioned the ginnie mae buyouts i was just wondering can you just talk about how that opportunity looks there going forward and then maybe just on the overall just the ppp production for the quarter and then indiscernible would be great thanks rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp just the last part again last part dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc oh sure so the ppp production in the quarter and then what you guys realized from an amortized fee perspective this quarter rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah okay so on the ginnies the ginnies it will be hard to continue to find places to purchase ginnies we keep working on it but at the end of the day particularly again because of the foreclosure modification and the extension going out we think theres just going to be fewer opportunities to do that in terms of the ppp loans michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp billion in the quarter rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp indiscernible mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp yeah we booked billion in ppp ph during the quarter most of that in march and then we had about billion of repayments so the repayments did push the income up a little bit but in total interest income from the ppp was relatively flat to slightly down a coupleofmillionbucks from last quarter dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc how much fees how many in the way of fees do you have now thats left indiscernible rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp we havent disclosed that number i dont think im not sure but we were modestly it did almost no change maybe it was down million michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp yeah rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp and we dont expect a significant change that will progressively move but by next quarter we dont expect a significant change on it michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp yeah it depends on the pace of repayments right rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp what i will tell you is that when you take a step back and think about the margin that we have the excess cash if you take the billion that i talked about before if you didnt have that that essentially takes your printed margin up over basis points and if you also exclude all of the ppp activity balances and now the income that has about a 9basispoint impact in the other direction so what really is interesting to me is that aside from those two factors our margin has held up really really well compared to historical terms but its just a little noisy you cant see it because of those two items dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah all right all right thanks for all the color operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi rené how are you rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp im doing well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good you havent lost your touch its like riding a bicycle huh rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp i dont know im doing slightly better than darren gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go got a question for you as you touched on already about the high amounts of liquidity that you have on your balance sheet the cash sitting at the federal reserve being up so dramatically like the entire industry because of quantitative easing and such i guess one of the questions i have for you is i can understand why jpmorgan chase and some of our big money center banks have seen such a surge in deposits because of quantitative easing can you walk through for us how the flow is coming into your organization in terms of the deposits thats forcing you now to increase your deposits in your reserves up to the central bank rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah thats a great question what you have to do is just to kind of go back prior to the pandemic and think about our operating model we more than most focus on core operating accounts right so we have never had a need to actually do a national what are they called indiscernible internet bank that raises money across the network were always raising money predominantly in our customer businesses with operating accounts and so what youre going to see when that happens with operating accounts all of the cash from the stimulus all of the cash from the monetary events that have taken place are actually going into customer accounts and because our proportion of customer accounts and core operating accounts are higher than most institutions you see the impact on mt is outsized now that means that weve got to manage it very closely so today for example were making sure that sort of nobody is renting our balance sheet for free and just parking money that nobody else wants again core operating concepts but thats the principal reason and you can actually draw a comparison between a percentage of both dda and lets say transaction accounts if you get that information across institutions and go before the crisis and then look today youll see thats the differentiator mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then to bring those balances down its not necessarily that youre going to take higher interest rates where they would maybe move the money out it would be more business activity picking up where they utilize the cash to grow their businesses rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp exactly exactly so thats one of the things that youll begin to see i think youre going to see both on the consumer side and business more spending i think it might be one of the factors which gives us the most uncertainty about loan growth because theres so much cash thats been built up and then if you start looking at certain factors its not just sentiment remember for example with middlemarket companies the supply chains are still not fully unlocked and back to normal right so thats preventing people from maybe building up inventories a very classic example would be the auto industry and so forth but you got that exactly right i would expect to see that a fair portion of this starts to increase spending both from consumers and commercial i also think this is my own opinion that events like pandemics will linger for a very long time and the idea that customers are going to keep higher ongoing levels of cash as a permanent way of doing business makes a lot of sense to me gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question and you touched on it in the answer you just gave me youre one of the better floor plan financiers throughout the northeast with autos can you talk to us to the very issue about the supply chain theres quite a bit written about the shortage of semiconductor chips affecting the production of automobiles what are your dealers telling you and how are they doing right now rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp well i think the dealerships are all doing fine right because the activity there is that its very difficult to get new cars but having said that theres a search around right for used cars and so as things for example as your car comes off lease right if you dont actually take on and buy that car they had some nice source of cars into the dealers and this is one of the principal reasons why used car prices are so high right if youre thinking about the third quarter of last year we thought were sort of record highs on used car prices and we thought that by the fourth quarter that would start to come down but those supply chains really havent unlocked and the prices are just continuing to go up which means the dealers are really healthy theres sort of a nice natural offset for them gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and if darrens listening get better quickly darren thank you rené rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 thanks gerard operator our next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hey matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just to push maybe one last time here on the cash part of the discussion so you definitely seem more confident that some of the cash is going to stick weve seen a pretty material rise in rates although off of a really low level and your loan trends are better than peers which i want to ask for my second question but its still just very modest growth like what are you waiting for to buy some securities and if you have loaded up on securities id ask you why youre buying so much so i ask at the extremes because if we took all your cash and put it in like some other banks i think it adds about to earnings so what are you waiting for rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp so this is how it goes matt this is how it goes internally right so darren and i call up scott warman and we ask that exact question every month what are you waiting for and then what we find out is were really really happy when the 10year was at its low that he didnt respond to us but when the 10year got itself up to the range weve dipped our toe back in the market but not significantly because we just kind of look through and we think that these bond prices dont make much sense from a longterm perspective and we know that right so while we could make a little bit more money were constantly focused on riskadjusted returns are we making the right decisions so while we might purchase a few more securities i dont it being a meaningful move or a meaningful change in the way we position it unless we see better riskadjusted returns on those portfolios donald j macleod a administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp matt the optionadjusted spread on passthroughs turned negative again so youre not being paid to take the negative convexity risk michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp yeah matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc well some other banks think differently but yeah its a 10year asset that youre locking in so very questionable agreed mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so a separate question the loans ticked up a little bit this quarter i think the industry overall was down kind of to you already touched on like the ginnie mae purchases ppp now a big swing factor youre probably benefiting from not having as much card run off but it still feels like ex everything loan trends are a little more resilient and im wondering if you would agree and whats driving that and then of course when things pick up mt usually doesnt lead the pack in terms of loan growth but how do you think youll fare versus the industry from here rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp i think that our ci customers are more optimistic than they were last quarter and the quarter before i think that sentiment will continue to change i think youre going to see more activity and the question will be a matter of timing do they use their cash and do they come up but the trends if you look at this quarter its actually pretty decent on the ci space when you net out the ppp effect so commercial real estate i dont expect to do much for the nearterm i think theres obviously a lot of pain there but theres also a lot of resetting going on the one place where i think weve talked about and everybody has talked about warehouse and industrial the issue there though is because its the only class in real estate that prices again pricing and economics have been competed away so it doesnt make any sense from an economic perspective for us to lean into that space so look i think were optimistic about loan growth for the longterm but its just going to take some time to start moving in the right direction matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey thanks and good morning its good to hear you in the again rené i know revenue synergies werent included in your initial guidance post the peoples united acquisition but rené can you discuss how much focus there is ahead of closing on doing everything you can to really hit the ground running in as you look at some of the opportunities that mt will have in your legacy markets and vice versa mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah well its kind of funny the actual and just the whole process of integration is really getting at that right what i would start by saying is we sort of set up our transition teams everybody on each sides of both organizations have met everything that weve seen particularly on the businesses that were not really part of have confirmed everything that we saw in due diligence number two were super impressed with their talent and their people and weve done a lot of acquisitions among all of them this one sort of stands out where the people who are running the business are really capable including the couple of businesses that we dont have so theres a lot of dialogue going on just around exactly what youre talking about and ill just remind you that we think for example from the mt side some of the capabilities that we have with small business banking our key treasury management capital markets expertise extending that to their customer base is going to provide a significant opportunity we have mt realty capital corp which allows us to meet the needs of real estate clients but not necessarily use our balance sheet for that and thats a new capability for them and of course wilmington trust combined with their wealth i think were going to bring a lot more capabilities combined than we would individually to the new england markets if you go the other way were very excited and continually excited about the equipment finance business and being able to offer those services to mts small business and middlemarket customers and so its not a short list right which is sort of one of the principal reasons that we felt that we could do a better job for our collective customers together than separately bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood just to follow up on not to beat a dead horse but to follow up on the excess liquidity discussion your rationale makes a ton of sense but i guess just looking at the numbers weve seen the securities portfolio go from over of your average earning assets in to just under this quarter at some point and youve talked around this but maybe could you just give a little bit of color on the extent to which youre worried that at some point youre competitively disadvantaged you have nothing else from the nii opportunity that youre foregoing even if it comes with some interest rate risk but maybe a little bit of color around that point rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp ill just simply say bill youre thinking about it the right way right i think that were very disciplined in that we look at almost every trade but you really have to step back and look at the overall balance sheet were below billion in securities right and so at some point youre really only going to go so low but if you compare that to when you make that decision and think on average where the 10year has been not today but where its been were really happy with our decision but at the same time youre totally right like you got to look at it as a portfolio and we do believe and were getting more and more evidence particularly as new programs come in like the infrastructure build that theyre talking about next right it gives us some sense that the risk is lowering and that the cash may be around a little bit longer so well have to look at that overall portfolio and realize how small can the securities portfolio get mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter of wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning rené rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hi peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about asset sensitivity in prior calls darren had said for each 25basispoint rate hike nim benefits to basis points but the balance sheet has gotten so much more asset sensitive and so i was wondering can you just give an update to the impact of nim from rate hikes and then secondly are there any plans to maybe reduce asset sensitivity with layering in some swaps rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp so first of all the numbers that darren gave like you just cited last quarter havent changed much at all were pretty much in the same position but its sort of the same topic right i mean so by putting on swaps youre turning a floating rate asset into a fixedrate asset said another way youre adding to your fixed rate exposure and you could do the same things with securities right but were really cautious about doing that and as don said locking in negative economic returns so its a good thing i mean another way to say it is that if youre worried about the negative economic returns one offsetting factor is that youre actually neutralizing yourselves right because we all think that rates cant go below zero but thats not true and so there is some added benefit to that but the swap issue is the same as the securities issue to me peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then can i just ask about the credit outlook just how youre thinking about net chargeoffs for the remainder of the year especially with not expecting much loss content in the hospitality portfolio rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah i think what darren has talked about is that well continue to remain at or maybe slightly above our historical average i think our term averages in the mid indiscernible range i think that if you think about just to give you a sense if you think about gross chargeoffs net of recoveries were about million last quarter million this quarter pretty steady mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 what was different about this that brought us down to basis points is that we had about million million more of recoveries one of those for example was on a company thats a supplier to the energy business or the fracking business a supplier of services there and the rest of them were across the board a smaller number of recoveries so the consistent trend i think is kind of there underlying that its hard to predict whats going to happen with recoveries but i think darrens comments makes sense maybe at or maybe slightly above for some period of time our long run average peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks rené operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning hey rené just one question on the fee side i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the residentialrelated fees were up and helped by higher gain on sale margins which is a nice bucking of the trend versus most industry peers can you just talk us through was that about timing or about mix re securitization and your forward thoughts on just how the mortgage business should act going forward thanks rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah you got it right timing and mix thats a perfect statement i think if you were to look at underlying margins as you think about purely margin to the customer those were flat to slightly down but there was a lot of noise in volume and rates moving around in between and so that sort of market sensitivity allowed us to capture more economics and so the overall gross margin was higher if i saw something that was slightly encouraging it was that while we had maybe just under increase in applications our pipeline at the end of the quarter was up so we kind of ended the quarter with the same momentum that we had or maybe slightly better than we did during the quarter so that should help as we next quarter i mean hard to predict whats going to happen with margin but that core underlying trend was slightly negative ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just on the trust income line another good performance there up sequentially did you have any incremental burden from money market fee waivers and if so do you know where that stands right now in an aggregate rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 yeah so thats a good point so when you look at those numbers we had nice growth but there was an offset from the money market waivers i think the total amount of waivers that we have around million or million that are embedded in that today and i think that increased by million quarteroverquarter donald j macleod a administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay last quick one in the s4 it mentioned that you guys will eventually give a million donation that would be i think you said at or prior to closing is that more of a closing quarter number that was that in this quarter or is that more of a closing quarter type of thing that you would do on the donation rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp so no what we did this quarter was separate from what we will do for peoples which well decide at the time of the close so what we did this quarter is i think we just had a slightly elevated number i think we made contributions of million and we typically have been doing about million i think last quarter was around million ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it so that million you mentioned would be more closer and contiguous with the closing itself rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp exactly exactly separate ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hi erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning rené and darren if youre listening i hope you feel better rené my questions have all been asked and answered thank you mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp okay any other question michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp there are still several more queued up operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi of piper sandler rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hi frank let me guess youre going to ask about cash frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co no i was going to but after the fourth question i decided to stray but i only have yeah i mean just on how much im trying to figure out how much capital might still be locked up in reserves not only for mt but for everybody and so just following up on the potential for additional reserve release is the best way to think about where the reserve to loan ratio sort of flushes out in a more normal environment just look back at cecl day one mark for you guys and for others and so for an mt maybe i think is where you guys were is that still the most reasonable place to put it rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah i mean i think ill say this i mean i dont disagree with what you said but what it comes down to is whats your loan mix and whats the quality of your underwriting and that for us really hasnt changed so today if i were to sit here to say answer the question could we get back to where we were in our lows or our normal sure were going to still see the same cycle ph a little bit sharper but in a calmer more neutral environment we would probably look like we did in the past frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a quick followup on ppp forgiveness you still have a significant level of ppp loans on the books and just wondering your thoughts on does the majority of that run off the books in the current quarter how should we think about that from modeling rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp no we have it running down sort of over time theres no sort of sharp drop in that space so i mean as youre thinking about quarteroverquarter and getting your way through the year and into next thats what i would think about it itd be a steady drop i think if you take mikes comments you kind of get a sense of the ins and outs and so i think we on the original ppp loans are we of the way through has been run off of the original ppp loans which started at about million billion are now gone and are there so that should give you some sense mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo securities rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey rené your ceo letter talks about new approaches with business banking from baltimore washington philly delaware virginia you have the iheartradio and interviews with local ceos so it seems like youre still revising your approach locally my question is what metrics do you track to monitor your progress and how those metrics changed and where do you hope those metrics will go i know youre not talking about the peoples united transaction but it would give a better sense for are you looking at market share by msa are you looking at average fees for business customer or what else are you looking at to monitor your progress rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp i think youll be happy to know its not fancy we measure the amount of checking accounts business banking checking accounts we open every month against the amount of checking accounts that we close on the ones that we close were trying to find the friction points and make things easier so that theyre not leaving and transitioning out and its very interesting that you asked the question because i mean weve seen just i would just ill just use the words i mean lets see how permanent it is but weve seen a dramatic increase in our business banking dda production primarily driven by new customer acquisition and i think whats happening is thats a combination of this idea that weve been introduced as a trusted partner through the ppp program weve been introduced to a lot more customers and at the same time its not been that long since we launched our small business online origination channel and so what were seeing is the combination of those two things i guess peoples awareness about our capabilities and what we do have actually increased so really simple every quarter whats happening with checking accounts are we opening them are they from existing customers new customers what are the msas theyre working in i have a real big bent on empowering our teams in the individual communities so the way in which do things in boston or new hampshire might be different than baltimore but the expectation on the metrics are going to be all the same how many quality checking account are reopening not necessarily how much lending were doing because we think all that leads to a healthy company will end up in the end doing loans and things like that with us mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just to follow up do you have any aggregate metrics that you expect that called out from the approach like i said it could be market share by msa or fees or just the level of growth or is one region lagging behind another region is like the southern portion a little behind rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah well i mean a couple of things we look at we look at weve talked about a lot were doing a lot around net promoter score we do a lot around the greenwich work and if you think about the greenwich work underneath it doesnt just tell you that you made a lot of loans it tells you how they survey your customers and they tell you where you stack up so do you do business with us are we your lead bank we sort of measure those things religiously and yeah i think what youll see is usually its the most ph volume thing we have is ranked we talk about it all the time are we the number one number two sba lender if were not the number one or two in our markets then why and whats happening in those spaces even that sba rank is not a pure thing because it doesnt cover everything but its a huge indicator of the activity and how engaged our workforce is if theyre not in the number one two or three spot in the community mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of saul martinez of ubs rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp hey saul saul are you there operator saul you are on mute saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc sorry about that i was on mute thanks for taking my question but how much in hedge income did you earn this quarter from your swap book i think you said million for the full year i dont think you gave a number indiscernible michael r spychala a senior vice president controller mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 its about million this quarter rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp its about million saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp i will say and im sure im in this little temporary ill get the stage for one morning but i tend not to worry about too much about looking at hedges on their own because the hedge always matters in the context of the rest of the portfolio and so to the extent that we decided to slow down our hedging or stop the hedging what basically youre left with is youre moving away from youve turned floating rate assets into fixed rate assets youre moving them back basically and the question is whats happening with the rest of the portfolio in past recessions we would see much higher margin on our rollon commercial loans and that would be replacing the rundown in the hedges and so the real issue is loan growth in my mind thats how i think about it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right right indiscernible rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp darren will change that next week so you only have days to think the way i do indiscernible saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc good got it just if i could pivot over to capital how youre thinking about your optimal capital position once the deal closes and i think youve talked about cet1 yield subject now to the june results so that seemingly gives you a healthy cushion and i believe you talked in the past about being sort of at the lower end of your peer group so putting all that stuff together like how are you thinking about capital returns and capital optimization and optimal capital as we head into rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp yeah your construct is right ultimately our desire is to run towards the lower end of our peers i think the context to think about is we went under a really really hard stress test last fall indiscernible last fall and we went into that test around and we were able to survive pretty severe space particularly in the real estate space which we saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2021 rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp have high concentration in were basis points above that today right so that tells you that starts to tell you the excess part the other thing is i think were going to see a change not immediately but over time around real estate exposure and how we think about those things because to the extent that theres sort of a de facto assumption of losses on real estate in the teens when you book it right well that begins to change the economic and we have to think about our portfolios because we believe just being efficient use of capital is really important so we thought a lot about how we might do certain things differently in the commercial real estate space and to the extent that we do that means that that will be even postion us better to be at the lower end of our peers saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats helpful rené f jones a chairman chief executive officer mt bank corp its really important saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all right thats helpful thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen that was our final question id like to turn the floor back over to don macleod for any additional or closing remarks donald j macleod administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor
