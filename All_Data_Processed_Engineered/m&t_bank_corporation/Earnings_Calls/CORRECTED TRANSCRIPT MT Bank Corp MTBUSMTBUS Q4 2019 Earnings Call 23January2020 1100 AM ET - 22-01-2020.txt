king darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thank you don and good morning everyone as noted in this mornings release mts results for the fourth quarter closed out a year of solid performance which included growth in earnings per common share growth in noninterest revenues with mortgage banking and trust fees leading the improvement a stable year overyear net interest margin notwithstanding the interest rate volatility we experienced in a credit environment that remains favorable which although nonaccrual loans increased slightly reflected the sixth consecutive year of credit losses below basis points and industryleading returns on shareholder capital with return on equity for the year improve slightly to and return on tangible common equity exceeding for the second consecutive year well review the numbers for the full year in a moment but first lets turn our attention to the results for the fourth quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the fourth quarter of compared with per share in the third quarter of and per share in the fourth quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis mts fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share down slightly from million and per common share in the prior quarter consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in 2018s fourth quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2019s third quarter and in the fourth quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and in the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the third quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity as a reminder both gaap and net operating earnings in the fourth quarter of were impacted by certain noteworthy items included in the fourth quarter results was a million contribution to the mt charitable foundation that amounted to million aftertax effect or per common share mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 also included in 2018s fourth quarter was a million reduction in mts provision for income taxes arising from an irsapproved change in the tax treatment of certain loan fees which was retroactive to this also amounted to per common share turning to the balance sheet and income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in the fourth quarter of down million from billion in the linked quarter the net interest margin declined to down basis points from in the linked quarter a higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the fed had an estimated basis points dilutive effect on the margin the higher cash balances were a result of elevated escrow deposits seasonally high commercial deposits and increased trust demand deposits we estimate that the lower shortterm interest rates on the feds july september and october rate actions pressured the margin by as much as basis points the linked quarter basis point decline in onemonth libor was another factor in the decline included in that basis point impact of lower rates was a decline in the overall cost of interestbearing deposits the cost of which declined by basis points compared with the linked quarter which provided a benefit to the margin of about basis points average loans increased million compared with the previous quarter the ongoing and planned runoff of residential real estate loans primarily acquired hudson city mortgage loans was more than offset by growth in other loan categories which increased in total by million or from the third quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans were about higher than in the prior quarter this included million seasonal increase in loans to vehicle dealers to finance their inventories combined with an almost equal increase in other ci loans commercial real estate loans were down less than compared with the third quarter reflecting payoffs as well as completed construction loans which did not rollover into permanent financing and a lower level of commercial mortgage loans held for sale residential real estate loans approximately half of which were acquired in the hudson city transaction continued the expected pace of paydowns and that portfolio declined by about or million consumer loans were up with growth in recreation finance loans and to a lesser extent indirect auto loans outpacing further declines in home equity lines and loans on an end of period basis loan growth was stronger in the commercial portfolios with commercial and industrial loans about higher than at the end of the prior quarter while commercial real estate loans were up about there were no particular regions or industries that stood out in terms of loan growth during the fourth quarter average consumer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office as well as cds over were up about compared with the third quarter as noted earlier elevated escrow deposits seasonally high commercial deposits and higher levels of trust demand deposits were the drivers of that increase turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the quarters results included million of securities valuation losses on our remaining portfolio of gse preferred stock compared with a million gain in the third quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were million in the quarter down about compared with the third quarter nonetheless origination revenues improved by million to a total of million as a result of higher gain on sale margin residential servicing revenues were little changed from the previous quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including both origination and servicing activities were million compared with million in the prior quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the fourth quarter compared with what was a record million in the linked quarter trust income was million in the recent quarter improved from million in the previous quarter and up from million in 2018s fourth quarter new business generation continues to be strong while the strength in equity markets has been a modest tailwind service charges on deposit accounts were million essentially unchanged from the prior quarter trading and fx gains were million improved from million in the previous quarter primarily reflecting customer interest rate swap activity done on behalf of commercial customers in connection with loan originations during the quarter turning to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were million down from million in the third quarter salaries and benefits declined by million to million from the prior quarter reflecting a lower head count and seasonally lower benefit cost other cost of operation for the recent quarter reflect a million reduction in the valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights recall that there was a million addition to the allowance in the third quarter excluding the changes in the valuation allowance other cost of operations declined by million driven largely by lower professional services expense the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter improved from in the previous quarter next lets turn to credit our credit quality continues to be pretty much in line with the trends weve been seeing for quite a while annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points in the fourth quarter of compared with basis points in the third quarter the provision for credit losses was million in the recent quarter exceeding net chargeoffs by million the excess provision primarily reflects loan growth the allowance for credit losses was billion at the end of december the ratio of the allowance to total loans was at the end of unchanged from the end of the third quarter and up basis point from the end of nonaccrual loans declined by million at december 31st compared with the prior quarter end the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans fell basis points to end the quarter at loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that have been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were million at the end of the quarter of those loans million or are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities well address cecl in a few moments during the discussion of our outlook for mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated at the end of compared with at the end of the third quarter decline reflects earnings retention during the quarter share repurchases and the impact of loan growth which in turn led to slightly higher end of period riskweighted assets mt repurchased million shares of its common stock during the past quarter costing an aggregate million next id like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2019s full year results gaapbased diluted earnings per common share were up from in net income was billion improved from billion in the prior year these results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of and respectively net operating income which excludes intangible amortization was billion up slightly from the prior year net operating income for expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was and respectively average diluted common shares declined by as a result of repurchase activity while the total payout ratio including common stock dividends was tangible book value per share grew to at the end of up from the end of as we reflect on our performance through the lens of relative performance against our peer group of large regional banks were particularly gratified by our growth in earnings per common share our return on tangible common equity and the absolute level of our net interest margin which remains at or near the top of the peers donald j macleod administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp let me just backtrack for a minute darren going back to the other cost of operations darren misspoke and said there was a decline of million it is million darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thank you don im not sure what i was looking at when i read that but thank you for the clarification okay so lets turn to the outlook looking forward into our outlook is fairly consistent with what we shared on the call last january as well as with the trends weve being seeing over the past quarter while gdp growth may slow from the pace seen in we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen since the last recession ended unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers financial positions are healthy consumer confidence remains relatively high although commercial customers have remained cautious as ongoing and unpredictable global events including disagreements over tariffs have led to sustained levels of uncertainty we were pleased to see progress toward the tailoring of capital and liquidity regulations for regional banks based on systemic risk to the us economy we are awaiting final approval for the capital regulations including the stress capital buffer for banks in the feds category like mt mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 its still unclear whether those rules will be in place for the ccar process however with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manners you expect here are a few thoughts for the coming year as we share our outlook on net interest income and the net interest margin well start with the caveat that when unfolds well likely be impacted by actions taken by the federal reserve as to short term interest rates after a year of volatility including three rate cuts over the course of the markets have calmed somewhat the markets currently are signaling an additional rate cut in towards the end of the year the fourth quarter net interest margin of is a good starting point to think about where were headed for we expect a lower combination of cash at the fed and investment securities as we enter the first quarter and for that lower level to persist over the course of the year this reflects a decline in escrow commercial and trust demand deposits from seasonal highs in the fourth quarter as well as a further repositioning of our portfolio of liquid assets as the feds tailoring rule for liquidity becomes effective the result will be a beneficial impact on the reported margin compared with the fourth quarter which could be as much as basis points loans outstanding grew on a full year average basis in and were up a similar on a yearend basis as has been the case for the past few years this reflected a decline in residential mortgage loans on a full year average basis offset by aggregate growth in other loan portfolios lending activity in the commercial bank in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate was characterized by better originations and a reduced level of payoffs and paydowns than was the case in we expect those trends to continue in as has been the case for the past several years we will continue to allow the residential real estate portfolio to runoff as we reposition the balance sheet to higher returning assets however the rate of decline on both a percentage and absolute dollar basis will slow compared to prior years as the portfolio of loans acquired with hudson city becomes a smaller percentage of the total given these factors our expectation for is that average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low singledigit pace in line with or perhaps a little better than what we saw in taken in aggregate our outlook for reflects a lower level of earning assets but with a higher proportion of loans than in which improves our return profile combined with some improvement in the margin from what we reported in the fourth quarter and a flat rate scenario we expect a low singledigit decline in net interest income on a yearoveryear basis we enter with a higher run rate in residential mortgage servicing revenues following the additions to our servicing and subservicing portfolios in thus yearoveryear growth is sort of baked in the outlook for residential originations is less clear with longterm rates above the low point seen this past summer the commercial mortgage banking business had a record year for both volumes and revenues in matching or beating that will be difficult but thats our goal for the outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in with growth in the low singledigit range with the exception of trust revenues which have been growing at a solid mid singledigit pace the fourth quarters operating expenses excluding the reduction in the msr valuation allowance are a good indication for the starting run rate for modeling last years gaap results included approximately million of items we do not expect to recur in the writedown of our investment in the asset manager and the settlement of the esop litigation that implies that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 total expenses on a gaap basis should be down yearoveryear the capabilities we added to our it division over the course of should enable us to continue to reduce professional services in the coming year as well other than normal wage growth we dont foresee the need to accelerate expenses beyond the current run rate wed remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits cost in the first quarter of which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items last year that increase was approximately million based on the proceeding we expect to be able to produce neutral to slightly positive operating leverage for the year our outlook for credit remains balanced just as we completed our sixth consecutive year of net chargeoff experience below basis points at the risk of sounding like a broken record ill caution you again that this trend cant continue and that losses will eventually tick upward there continue to be some loss pressures on nonperforming and criticized loans but there are no apparent weaknesses in any particular industries or geographies our adoption of the new loan loss accounting standard known as cecl was effective january our expectation based on forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of december is that the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately million or to our reserves with total commercial reserves being down slightly reflecting shorter contractual maturities and residential mortgage and consumer reserves increasing substantially due to their long dated maturities for regulatory capital purposes we have elected to phase in the cecl transitional amount over a threeyear period therefore the effect of the adoption on the capital ratios will be recognized in a uniform manner resulting in a reduction to the cet1 ratio by approximately basis points over each of those three years cecl also impacts the accounting for loans previously acquired at a discount that are on our balance sheet acquired impaired loans will transition from days past due and accruing to their current performance status whether accrual or nonaccrual approximately million of the acquired impaired loans will transition to nonaccrual status the income from these loans will only be recognized on an as cash is received basis consistent with originated nonaccrual loans lastly in the future our loss provision will reflect expected net chargeoff activity plus cecl reserves for loan growth by category plus or minus changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast we dont see anything meaningful on the horizon that would lead us to believe that the tax rate for will be significantly different from what it was in in the area of as to capital well continue to execute our capital plan through the end of this years second quarter our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged with investments in our business at high returns being our first priority while paying a dividend thats sustainable through economic cycles after that we seek but dont reach for acquisitions that make sense and add value to our shareholders our customers and our communities when those arent forthcoming we return capital to shareholders we have little appetite for warehousing capital over an indeterminate timeframe until those opportunities present themselves of course as youre aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 now lets open up the call to questions before which lauri will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys hey darren just on the expense front im wondering if you can just clarify a little bit on the point that gaap expenses you expect to be down because they had that million and you mentioned that the core you dont see it really changing from what the growth rate is so the core can you just help us understand without having to accelerate investments what you see as the core underlying growth rate of expenses that you should expect darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so i guess if you look at the full year expenses on a gaap basis youve got about million of one times in the litigation the addition of litigation reserve as well as the writedown on the asset manager and then when you look at that number and you look at where we grow from there its or less ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then can you talk about the puts and takes just in that or less so youre making some investments that youve talked about in the last couple where youre getting the saves out of and that confidence that you can keep it or less relative to the growth that wed seen in the last couple of years thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah when we look at the trajectory weve been on remember that a big portion of last years growth in expenses was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we both acquired and took on in the form of subservicing so we had that expense to support that revenue and then the rest of what was happening was this transition of our it capabilities from professional services to salary and benefits and we started to see those professional services come down in the fourth quarter which we expected and we expect that trend to continue into and so as we go forward the gains in efficiency that we will get or expenses from reducing professional services will offset salaries and benefits as that cycle continues itself so we think were at a point where were selffunding and thats why we feel confident that the run rate that were at now we can basically run at that ex normal increases that happen in salaries and benefits as you go from yeartoyear ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks darren operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning on that same line of questioning the figure operating leverage comment that you expect positive operating leverage thats on a gaap basis just to confirm correct darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp that is correct john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay and then looking at it from what you would just walk through in terms of core that would imply a modest negative on a core basis then darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp on a core basis that would yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay and then in terms of your ongoing it and franchise investments i know you had indicated last quarter that they are largely complete is that still how youre viewing it or is there any change to the ongoing infrastructure investments that youre making darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well were continuing on the transition that weve talked about and that really is building up our internal it capability and we had the uptick in that got that process started but from where we end the year were now in a place where were seeing professional services come down that offset the salaries and benefits costs that were adding as were making those conversions and the place that were at now is we think that those investments are kind of selffunding and so that with the expense base that were at now we can continue that transition without having to have meaningful growth as we get to the other end of it obviously its our expectation that well continue to use those internal team members to improve the expense run rate into and but obviously well give you more details on that when we get there but for the purposes of we think were at a place where we can operate basically at the level that were at now with some modest growth from here john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i wanted to enquire a little bit more about the potential for the margin beyond the first quarter heard you loud and clear that balance sheet action is going to be quite accretive in the first quarter if the curve stays or the curve forecast stays static how should we think about the net interest margin trajectory beyond the first quarter and also as we think of earning asset growth should we expect earning asset growth to be flat relative to the actions that youre taking or should we expect some balance sheet shrinkage darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so in the first quarter we expect the net interest margin to increase at least what the printed margin is because of the change that youll see in cash and investment securities and you can kind of see that at the end of period and those lower levels we expect to persist throughout the year so when you get to the first quarter margin and assuming as you pointed out a fairly stable rate environment we would expect that margin that we end the first quarter with to be fairly consistent throughout the year assuming that that forward curve in fact occurs maybe plus or minus a couple of basis points along the way but relatively stable we anticipate that the average earning assets will start the year lower and then come up as the year goes on as we see the loan growth that we talked about in the forecast that overall is kind of low singledigits and along the lines of what we saw in as we go through erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my followup question and i apologize youre probably going to get a expense questions but we just want to make sure were getting it right so as we think about the run rate for if we take million out of gaap thats billion and youre saying growth of or less that includes any nominal increase in salaries and benefits so in total core should go up or less from that billion base darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats right yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch perfect thank you mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter of wedbush securities peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hey im just curious on the capital you ended the year at im just wondering where you think its going to end in and then secondly how much is left in your stock buyback authorization darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so where well end is a little bit tough to predict just depending on what happens with the tailoring rules and scb as we go into ccar this year which will have an impact obviously on where we might bring the capital ratios to and then the other thing that were paying attention to is just the pace of loan growth and in particular riskweighted assets but if you look at where weve been over the course of the last actually kind of or quarters its been coming down around basis points to basis points a quarter and we continue a measured movement down towards the low end of the peer group and over the course of the last year i believe weve gone from being slightly above our peer median in terms of our cet1 ratio to slightly below the median and well continue a measured and thoughtful move down towards the range that weve discussed for some time now obviously paying attention to whats going on in the macro environment and whats happening with loan growth and if you look at whats left outstanding in the capital plan that we discussed or disclosed in july its around million million peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and just given youre doing some of the work on remixing the balance sheet to help the margin im just wondering any updated thoughts on the hedging strategy darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp nothing that is different from what weve talked about in the past if you look at where weve been our notional amount has grown but whats actually outstanding has been relatively consistent in terms of notional dollars its billion billion of cash flow hedges plus another billion billion of debt and what weve been doing is just extending some of those out into future years to have that same amount of protection in place for a little bit longer peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 okay thanks darren operator your next question comes from the line of frank schiraldi of piper sandler frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just on just trying to ask the capital question other way just curious and i know you got the ccar cycle coming up but given how little impact cecl has to regulatory capital levels here just curious your thoughts on capital return overall for the back half of the year is it sort of the expectation or i dont know the wish list that you would continue to return 100plus capital of earnings darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess we dont peg it as a payout ratio number that were looking to achieve but more were projecting forward what we think our loan growth will be and what our riskweighted asset growth will be and looking at what capital we think we need to fund or to support that loan growth and make sure that were running an organization that is very safe and sound we continue to believe that we can move the current ratio down and well continue to do it at the pace that weve been on for the last several quarters being consistent in terms of what that decline is any quarter you might see some difference between what the changes in the ratio based on primarily asset growth in the quarter but when you look over the long term over the last few quarters weve been on a pretty steady pace i think one of the things that were also going to be watching as we go through the first part at least of is just how the new cecl methodology impacts earnings on any given quarter which will be impacted by the mix of loan growth in that quarter and just making sure that were thoughtful with those capital returns but as you pointed out given where we are were pleased that impact on our capital ratios from ccel was fairly nominal and so we can continue on the trajectory that weve been on frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then just sort of a tickytacky question on the provision given if the environment if the credit environment stays as is for lets hope given the day one cecl adjustment is it and i know a lot more goes into it than this but is it sort of fair for just modeling to assume provisioning goes up by sort of that number all else equal darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 i guess i havent done that math the way i tend to think about it is youve got chargeoffs that will happen and then if you look at net growth in loans and look at the new allowance rate and multiply those two that probably gets you the excess provision and of course if you look in any quarter the mix of loans that drive that shift in portfolio can move that around but if you look over the course of full year we wouldnt anticipate any meaningful mix shift in terms of where the growth is coming from on a percentage basis which would give you that allowance percentage is a reasonable starting point as i said it could move around a little bit within that quarter but over the course of the year i would expect it to be within a few basis points of that number frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay all right great thanks darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi darren how is everything darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good how are you steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good ill just start so regarding the anticipated decline in liquidity in if we look at your quarter recorded down billion do you think youre going to have a similar decline in or is it much larger than that just given how much more deposit growth youve had recently darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp its probably going to be larger than that given the trust demand business was probably the primary driver if you look back in prior years plus a little bit of the commercial commercial balances tend to move up in the fourth quarter and then these companies as they prepare to make their distributions to their owners thats why you see them come down in the first quarter and so thats pretty typical and i think businesses are still having a little bit more of their cash sitting in operating accounts versus in interestbearing and then the other thing thats happened this year for us obviously is weve increased the escrow balances and there is some seasonality to those so when you put all those factors together youd probably get a bigger decrease there and then well be looking at the securities portfolio in aggregate and that will probably come down a little bit too as we react to the new changes in the lcr mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you and then on the trust income which came in much stronger than the original guidance called for it and it didnt sound like market appreciation was a big factor give me more color on why that was so strong this year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so theres a couple of things that happened there we have within there a business that holds retirement assets and when you add claims to that they can come in in big chunks and weve had one big retirement fund that came in during the course of year thats kind of hard to predict and that helped with some of the trust fees as well as in our what we call our institutional client services business there seem to be a little bit more activity in that business as the back half of the year went on which helped with the trust fees and obviously when i talked about that retirement business the assets that came on also grew because of the markets and so there was some help from the markets to be sure but the business continues to add team members and add clients and has had a strong year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful maybe just one final one on expenses i appreciate the color on the expense growth in given the reinvestment some of the cost saves but what is expense growth at mt running at these days without cost saves whats the natural organic growth rate of expenses thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp when i think about our natural organic growth rate and you look at us through time and you hold to the side some of the things that have happened with various litigation expenses or mortgage servicing rights or the writeoff that we had were kind of a low singledigit grower and thats mainly driven by compensation costs yearoveryear last year was just kind of outsized because of the mortgage the growth of the mortgage servicing business and then step one in our transformation for technology but generally when you look at how we run the bank we pay a lot of attention to our growth rate in expenses because we know were in a tough industry and so were always looking for ways to manage those and keep them in aggregate growing at low singledigits and making investments and finding offsets to cover the cost to keep it at that pace and that philosophy hasnt changed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful thanks for all the color darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp how are you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good can you give us some color on that residential mortgage portfolio you indicated it was down i think the runoff that is down about you expect it to be less this year it looks like your resi mortgages at the end of the year just over billion or of total loans where do you see that eventually bottoming out when does the runoff from the deal that youve done and we have a stabilized number from that portfolio darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure its a good question gerard as we watch the portfolio of residential mortgage loans when you look underneath there its down to about half legacy hudson city mortgages and half legacy mt plus new originations were allowing that hudson city portfolio to run down and well continue to just because of the return profile of the mortgage business and the rate of growth or the rate of decline in aggregate in the mortgage portfolio is slowing just because the hudson city mortgages are becoming a smaller percentage but well continue to run those down well probably youll see a little bit more growth in the legacy business especially some of that comes from the servicing business but youre not going to see it it hit a steady state likely in the only thing that as we work through the new liquidity rules after the tailoring that were contemplating as what role the mortgage portfolio plays in overall funding since the mortgages are pledgeable with the federal home loan bank for funding on a shortterm basis so there is a number of considerations that go into where that portfolio ultimately ends but we probably continue seeing it move down but in a smaller dollar amount over the course of gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i know the rules are not set yet on the scb but from what you understand today and assuming they dont vary dramatically from what we all understand do you expect any kind of meaningful impact come ccar because of if they incorporate the scb in ccar this year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess if they incorporate it it would be helpful because the threshold that you have to meet would be lower and therell be some opportunity there theres also been talk of not having to prefund the dividend and not having an assumption of asset growth under stress which all of those things are positive mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 the offset to that is what our loan growth assumptions look like and in particular what the mix is in terms of risk weighted assets that will be an offset but its obviously remains to be seen how this will be implemented by the fed given that there is unlikely to be an npr before and it will all be handled through the rules and the assumptions that are provided to us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys good morning i guess we have more minutes a couple of questions one just a followup on cecl by my calculations your acl ratio goes roughly from about basis points to about basis points as i think about the changes in you mix and the loss content on your net loan growth because there is obviously a lot going on there with resi coming down consumer going up how do i think about the loss content the lifetime losses on your growth relative to your back book is the net growth in loans those with lifetime loss of above basis points i know it doesnt change in any given quarter all that much but should we think that acl ratio naturally gravitate upwards over time as your balance sheet remixes darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess if your time horizon is years and we dont do anything to change the growth rates of the various portfolios thats probably true i think if you look in the shortterm and shortterm in this case will be like over the next to months you probably dont see much change in that just because the start point on some of those other portfolios meaning the other consumer is relatively small as a percentage compared to the resi mortgage the commercial real estate and the ci and that assumes that we dont do anything to look at those portfolios and look for alternatives like youre seeing some of the other organizations thinking about auto securitizations for instance we havent done one of those in a while im not suggesting that we are going to do one but that would have an impact on obviously the portfolio and the allowance in there because if you did a securitization that allowance would come off so a number of moving factors but i guess the short answer to your question is your math is consistent with ours and i think it would take at least a couple of years of running at the rate that were at with no change to see that number go up saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay thats helpful all right let me just change gears a little bit at a conference in early november i think it was the baab conference you highlighted some of your key metrics versus your longterm averages and your nim i think you were at substantially higher than what the premium of your nim the delta between your nim and the peer median was substantially higher today than it has been historically i think it was like basis points or something like that and historically its basis points or something something in that neighborhood it seems like from your outlook you think that really elevated delta with your peer group should remain not too far from where it is today and i think you were kind of hinting at the conference that maybe that excess nim versus your peers will gravitate down over time am i reading that right i mean whats mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 changed since november other than obviously the rate outlook but am i reading that right that you think you will be able to maintain a premium nim that is historically high darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess ill break apart your statement into two pieces do we think well be able to maintain a premium nim yes thats kind of always been the nature of our portfolio largely because of our funding mix but also because of the pricing on our loan book its been a little higher than what we would normally expect and especially in this kind of time period and you can see that the gap between us and the next closest peer the median has come down a little bit but really when you look over the last couple of quarters its has been fairly consistent saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we would need to see rates come down a little bit further to see that delta compress but we expect over time ph that we try to run the bank to have a slightly lower cost of deposit and a slightly higher yield on our loans and manage our expenses a little bit better in credit its not our objective to be outsized performance in any one of those categories but a little bit better in each one and over long periods of time that adds up to consistent returns which is really what our objective is and some of them may move a little bit in any one time period be that a quarter or a year but over long periods of time thats kind of how we try to run the bank to achieve the returns that we do so we expect that the margin obviously given the earlier comments in a stable rate environment we expect the margin to be relatively stable this year given that we would expect to maintain our premium over the our gap our positive gap compared to the next closest in the median but any movement down and youll probably see a little bit of that road but we dont see ending up back at the median saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right so as long as the rate environment remains stable that historically high delta theres no reason why that should compress darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah from what we can see we believe that that will persist saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thats really helpful thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 sure why would you comment about minutes i thought you were going to use all operator your next question comes from the line of brian klock of keefe bruyette woods brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning darren and don hey were set up for a good next year right darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we sure hope so but were not planning a parade yet but were certainly hopeful brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i mean hope springs eternal a mouthful every year right so lets hope so darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc but i think i do have five minutes left in the morning i think thats what saul was referring to before we say good afternoon but i just had two really quick followups i know youve had all kinds of questions today on both of these topics so just want to clarify a little bit on the margin guidance the basis points darren now is that all liquidity driven basis points or i think you guys whether its like december or early january i think you redeemed some debt so that kind of factored into that sort of basis points nim improvement into the early part of darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp it is its impact is in the grand scheme of things relatively small on the nim impact the main drivers are the cash and securities brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it got it it makes sense and again on expenses this is a question but like you mentioned here the core expense run rate call it less than inflation in on a core basis and it feels like with all those tax expenses kind of consolidated and coming out like you said in recycling do you think is one of those where expenses are flat or is it just maybe normal mt expense inflation out into darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp im just recovering from doing the plan for let alone so i havent quite looked at that far ahead yet but i guess ill remind you of who we are and how we run the bank and that is to be very careful with our expense mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 growth and make sure that we see a path if we make those investments to bring it back down or that there is offsetting revenue like we did with the mortgage business this year the low singledigit increase as i mentioned before is primarily the result of salary inflation who knows where wage inflation ends up through if unemployment rate stays as low who knows where we will end up but we continue to believe that in the banking business efficiency matters and being cost effective matters so we pay a lot of attention to that and then of course if we can drive that growth down to something less than or even negative we will look to do that but too early for me to make comments really about where that will be in brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats fair i thought id ask it anyway so but appreciate your time thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp it was a good try operator thank you ill now return the call
