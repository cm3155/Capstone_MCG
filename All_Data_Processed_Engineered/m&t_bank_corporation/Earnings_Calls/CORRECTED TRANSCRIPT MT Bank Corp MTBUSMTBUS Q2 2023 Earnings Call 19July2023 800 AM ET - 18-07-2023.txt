here we highlight our commitment to the environment we have invested over million in renewable energy sector and significantly reduced our electricity consumption since our esg report will be published soon but i encourage you to review this slide for some of the highlights turning to slide our second quarter results reflect the strength of our core earnings power balance sheet and liquidity position adjusted to exclude the million pretax gain from the sale of the collective investment trust or cit business in april second quarter revenues have grown million or compared to last years similar quarter this translates to a positive operating leverage yearoveryear on the same basis preprovision net revenues have increased since last years second quarter to billion credit remained stable net chargeoffs increased in the second quarter but yeartodate still remained below our historical longterm average net income for the quarter was million up from linked quarter diluted gaap earnings per share was for the second quarter up sequentially now lets review our net operating results for the quarter on slide mts net operating income for the second quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million up from linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per share common share were for the recent quarter compared to in this years first quarter tangible book value per share increased to on slide you will see that on a gaap basis mts second quarter results produced an annualized return on average assets and return on average common equity of and respectively results for the second quarter of this year included an aftertax million gain on the sale of the cit business in april excluding this mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 gain adjusted gaap earnings per share was and adjusted return on average assets and average common shareholder equity was and next lets look a little bit deeper into the underlying trends that generated our second quarter results please turn to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the second quarter slightly below linked quarter this decline was driven by higher volumes of noncore funding and unfavorable mix change caused by disintermediation partially offset by higher interest rates and one additional day net interest margin for the past quarter was down basis points from linked quarter the primary driver was the decrease due to the margin was partially impacted from the mix change to the higher cost funding which we estimate reduced the margin by basis points higher yields on earning assets net of rates on deposit funding benefited the margin by basis points turning to slide capital levels remained strong with a cet1 ratio to the end of the second quarter at average earning assets increased billion or from the first quarter to the second quarter due largely to the billion growth in average loans and billion increase in average investment securities turning to slide we talk about the drivers on the loan growth the total average loans and leases were billion during the second quarter up billion compared to the linked quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the first quarter commercial and industrial loans increased to billion we continue to see in our dealer and specialty businesses plus we are adding new customers as we grow market share in legacy and new markets during the second quarter average commercial real estate loans decreased to billion the decline was driven largely by lower construction loan balances average residential real estate loans were billion essentially flat compared to the first quarter of this year average consumer loans were down to billion driven by lower activity due to rising interest rates turning to slide average investment securities increased to billion during the second quarter due to the large part to purchases linked at the end of the first quarter the duration of the investment securities book at the end of june is years and the unrealized pretax loss on the availableforsale was only million at the end of june cash and interestbearing deposits at banks and the investment securities totaled billion turning to slide deposit outflows during the second quarter on an average basis accounted to billion or in line with industry trends consistent with our experience prior to rising rates the increased competition for deposits and customer behavior is leading to a mix shift with the deposit base to highercost deposits comparing the second to first quarters average demand deposits declined billion savings and interestbearing checking deposits decreased million while time deposits increased billion decline in average demand deposits resulted predominantly from a billion decline in the corporate trust balances due in part to a large to lower capital markets activities the movement to sweep products as customers seeking higher yields with billion onbalance sheet and billion shifted offbalance sheet sweep accounts during the second quarter average time deposit growth was driven by billion in broker cds and billion growth consumer time deposits we remain focused on growing and retaining deposits endofperiod deposits grew billion or from the end of the first quarter the growth was largely driven by broker cd balances which increased billion compared to the end of linked quarter however since the end of may our customer base for wholesale deposit mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 balances have stabilized and started to grow with an increase of million driven largely by growth in commercial and consumer deposits now lets discuss noninterest income please turn to slide noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter compared to million linked quarter as noted earlier the second quarter included million gain from the sale of our cit business recall that mt normally receives an annual distribution from bayview lending group during the first quarter of the year this distribution was million in this years first quarter excluding these two items second quarter noninterest income increased million compared to the first quarter mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter up from linked quarter driven by million in additional servicing revenues representing the full quarter impact of the bulk of the msr purchase completed at the end of march service charges on deposits were million or up compared to the first quarter trust income of million in the recent quarter declined from million in the first quarter due largely to the million in lower fee income resulting from the sale of the cit business partially offset by the impact of the seasonal tax preparation fees our revenue from operations adjusting from the gain from the cit sale and the distribution at bayview lending group in this years first quarter were million down million sequentially turning to slide for expenses operating expenses which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were billion in the second quarter of this year down million from the linked quarter as is typical for mts first quarter results operating expenses in the first quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs excluding the seasonally higher compensation in the first quarter operating expenses increased million sequentially that increase was due to million in higher compensation and benefit costs reflecting higher average head count the full impact of the annual merit increases and severance costs million and higher other operating expenses related to the bulk of the msr purchase these increases were partially offset by lower cit related expenses including million of lower subadviser expenses and lower advertising and marketing and deposit insurance expenses given the prospect of slowing revenue growth we remain focused on diligently managing expenses the efficiency ratio which excludes the intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and the security gains and losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared to in 2023s first quarter excluding the gain from the sale of the cit business the second quarter the efficiency ratio was next lets turn to slide for credit the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the second quarter up million from the end of linked quarter in the second quarter we recorded a million provision in credit losses compared to million in the first quarter net chargeoffs were million in the second quarter compared to million in this years first quarter the reserve build was largely due to anticipation of declining commercial real estate values and loan growth at the end of the second quarter nonaccrual loans were million a decrease of million compared to the prior quarter and represent a of loans down basis points sequentially as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million the increase in net chargeoffs was driven by four large credits three mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 office buildings in new york city and washington dc and one large healthcare company operating in new york state annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the second quarter compared to basis points in the first quarter this brings our yeartodate net chargeoffs to basis points which is below our longterm average of basis points as we have noted previously we expect net chargeoffs to be lumpy on a quartertoquarter basis this is the result of unique nature of each property and borrower in order to identify emerging issues that could lead to loan grade adjustments we continue to perform ongoing rate risk resizing risk tenant sensitivities and commercial real estate portfolios on a quarterly basis this work is reflected in our criticized loan portfolio loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest for million at the end of the first quarter compared to million sequentially and totaled of these loans days past due loans were guaranteed by the government or governmentrelated entities turning to slide for capital mts cet1 ratio at the end of june was an estimated compared to at the end of the first quarter the increase was due in part the higher net income and repurchasing shares in the second quarter in june tangible common shareholder equity totaled billion up from the end of the prior quarter tangible book value per share accounted at up from the end of the first quarter in late june the federal reserve released results from the annual bank stress test while this was an off year for category iv banks given the timing of the peoples united acquisition mt participated in the stress test this year our preliminary stresstest capital buffer or scb is estimated to be using the scb which is in effect from october to september well be subject to cet1 ratio now turning to slide for the outlook as we look forward to the second quarter of this year we believe we are well positioned to navigate through a challenging economic conditions however the rapidly changing interest rate expectations combined with continued pressure on funding affect our outlook for the full year the outlook reflects the impact of the sale of the mt insurance agency that closed in october of last year and the sale of the cit business that closed in april of this year first lets talk about net interest income outlook we expect taxableequivalent net interest income to trend towards the lower end of the billion to billion range which reflects a flat to modestly higher loan and deposit growth and incorporates basis point hike in august of this year we noted on the first quarter call a key driver of net interest income in will be the ability to efficiently fund earning assets we expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industrywide outflows full year average deposit balances are expected to be up lowsingle digits compared to we continue to expect the deposit mix the shift towards higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits and onbalance sheet sweeps this is expected to translate to a throughthecycle interestbearing deposit beta through the fourth quarter of this year to the low to mid40 range this deposit beta excludes broker deposits next lets discuss the outlook for average loan growth which should be the main driver of earning asset growth we expect the full year average loans and leases balances during to be relatively stable the mix of ci cre and consumer loans inclusive of consumer real estate loans is almost onethird each as of the end of june mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 we expect this trend to shift slightly to ci growth outpacing cre as we have seen over the past four quarters higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth of our consumer loan book over the remainder of turning to fees we expect noninterest income to be in the range of billion to billion range this outlook for noninterestbearing reflects lower trust revenues resulting from the sale of the cit business in april as well as the incremental income from the bulk purchase of residential mortgage servicing rights at the end of this years first quarter remember the outlook does not include the million gain from the sale of the cit business turning to expenses we anticipate expenses excluding intangible amortization to trend near the higher end of billion to billion in addition this outlook for net operating expenses includes the impact of the previously mentioned sale of the cit business and the bulk mortgage servicing purchase intangible amortization is expected to be in the million to million range turning to credit we expect loan losses to be near mts longterm average of basis points although the quarterly cadence could be lumpy provision expense over the year will follow the cecl methodology and be affected by changes in the macro outlook and loan balances for we expect taxable equivalent rate to be in the range finally as it relates to capital this is a very clear differentiator for mt our capital coupled with our investment with our limited investment security ph marks has been a clear strength during these turbulent times mt has proven to be a safe haven for our clients and communities the strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary we take our responsibilities to manage our shareholders capital very seriously and will return more when its appropriate to do that our businesses are performing very well and we are growing new relationships each and every day given the uncertainties related to the new capital rules that are coming out we believe now is not the time to be repurchasing shares that said we are best positioned to use our capital for both organic and inorganic growth along with buybacks in the future which will always be part of our core capital distribution strategy in the meantime our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients communities regulators investors and rating agencies to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis our economic uncertainty remains high and that is when mt has historically outperformed its peers mt has always been a purpose driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholders we have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles with more than times growth relative to peers our strong shareholder returns include to return on average tangible common equity and robust dividend growth finally we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital our integration of peoples united is complete and we are confident in our ability to realize our potential postmerger now lets open up the call to questions before which todd will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a question on nii noticed you took your deposit balance guide up along with the deposit beta guide but kept the nii guide the same so can you talk about the puts and takes there i guess the question is why hold more liquidity and hold more in interestbearing deposits in an environment where youre not growing loans that much is it more a function of any upcoming lcr rules or anything the regulators are asking you to do daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah manan thank you for the question what i would tell you is is that we start right now each and every day in making sure we have really strong liquidity on our balance sheet and we want to make sure that is a really good strength as we continue to move through these times our deposits we believe we are in great position to continue to grow and gain share in our markets that were serving so we are aggressively going out and trying to get deposits from our clients and core customers out in these marketplaces the beta guide did go up but its really a mix of how much of funding we get from core versus broker deposits when the crisis first started in march we took down federal home loan bank advances this quarter this past quarter and second quarter we access the broker cd market we thought that was a good use and when we access the broker cd market that automatically increased their deposit beta so if you look at our deposit beta this quarter it was but if you back out the broker cds its worth points so it was down to so the guide is that we gave going up to low to mid was really excluding the broker deposits because you dont know if were going to issue more broker deposits its going to be a mix between federal home loan bank advances broker deposits and actually issuing debt in the marketplace so its a really mix and its really up to our treasury team to figure out whats best to do for our company but right now having liquidity is really important and really gaining share and serving our clients we think is really important as well mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so you took cash up this quarter and it sounds like youre going to keep it at a high level for some time daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yes yeah were going to continue to keep really strong liquidity and continue to stay where it is and its one of the strengths that we have in the marketplace right now manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just as a followup the debt markets seem to be opening up can you talk about how youre thinking about issuance for the remainder of the year just keeping in mind the possibility that tlac rules could apply to banks of your asset size daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah when you look at the three sources i just talked about whether its broker deposits federal home loan bank advances or debt early on when youre going into a crisis it makes sense to access the home loan bank first because its there available when you get it really fast in size broker markets i think were a good use this past quarter and over time you will see us issue unsecured debt and basically pay off some of the home loan bank advances and probably some of the broker deposits over time and thats just normally how we would fund this bank overall but we start with really having really good core funding and making sure our core funding is growing and doing what it needs to from that perspective manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp okay operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning just i guess first a followup on the capital obviously strong built quite a bit and you talked about letting it continue to build as you wait for new capital rules but i guess how high are you willing to let it get i think under kind of new rules it seems like you have excess and obviously a good outcome from ccardfast so i guess first question is how high are you willing to let it go and then maybe just kind of review the priorities in terms of capital deployment as you think about the next couple years mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so let me start with the capital deployment question first and foremost we want to make sure we serve our clients and our communities so organic growth is number one on how we deploy capital and during turbulent times like this we want to make sure that all of our customers and potential new customers that we won and want to join mt that we have the capital there to serve and thats first and foremost ph when we start dividends obviously the second second is dividend growth and we have a long history of our dividend policy and keeping really strong dividends at mt really really value a strong dividend from that perspective and share buyback has always been part of our history of repurchasing shares and from time to time we might do any acquisitions if they make sense and its a good shareholder value from that perspective but long term theres really not a change because right now in these turbulent times were keeping extra capital and we think its prudent to do that as we get more information from the rules that come out from the regulators but right now we are doing really well our business is performing well were getting new clients in the commercial area business banking wealth corporate trust i mean our businesses are growing because we are strong so i think its an advantage right now to have a lot of capital matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just separately last fall darren threw out this kind of longterm nim range i think it was to that kind of spooked folks a little bit but obviously you guys were kind of ahead of the curve and messaging the overearning on deposits and you did get to the high end of that nim range this quarter wondering if you still think thats kind of a good longterm range and do you get below that range at some point in the cycle if you had to guess thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so i want to give darren a lot of credit he was definitely ahead of the industry in talking about margin and the impact to margin and he saw it coming and i think he was a leader in telling people where everything was going so it was really really good guidance from that perspective i would say that we will continue to have margin pressure just because of the cost of what were seeing on the funding side were having disintermediation and if you look at it our dda was down billion we retained all the clients some of the balances went to onbalance sheet sweeps some of them went into offbalance sheet sweeps if you look at our consumer book we are moving balances from nonmaturity buckets to cds but if you go back 20plus years and you look at the deposit that we had back then cds were 20plus percent of our funding base right now were at and were probably going to be in the midteens before its all said and done it really depends on how long rates stay higher and thats just the normal mix of how we run our retail bank i mean its the right thing to do its the right thing for our clients its the right thing for our bank we can adjust our rate sensitivities with cds on the books and manage that really well so its just basically ph learning things that when you ran banks years ago were doing the same thing right now and doing it the same way but we feel really good about our businesses mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 margin pressures going to continue to come down and i think weve given you some guidance for this year dont really want to get into right now until we get working on our plan which would be later this quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thanks matt operator thank you well take our next question from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and thank you for the earnings slide deck daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thank the team steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc appreciate it daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah the team did a great job steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the noninterestbearing deposits so when i look at the decline this quarter its still perplexing to me that this mix shift is not basically done by now right if youre a commercial customer you have a treasury function id imagine youve done the analysis and youve already moved those balances but you guys are now guiding you expect more decline in dda mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 when you look at your client base can you walk us through why is this taking so long i mean its been quite a few quarters right the two years has been above or whats still to happen to cause this mix shift daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thank you for the question steven first and foremost if you look at mt and you look at precovid and going in into covid mt had one of the largest increases of surplus balances of all the banks out there proportionately so were starting at a really high strength i think our dda percentage of total deposits was yeah so it was really high to start with and if you look at how we run this company as i learn about this company i am just amazed at how well we are getting primacy getting the operating accounts we are really good in the consumer business in our business banking business and commercial businesses we lead with getting operating accounts so we have a disproportionate amount of operating accounts there so that said to answer your question it just means that were going to continue to have mix shift changes it does seem to be slowing down a bit but were still seeing some mix change happen and its going to continue to put a little bit pressure on funding but were still serving our clients at the end of the day and were gaining new clients too so i think all in all i think were doing good we still have a pretty high margin overall if you look at others in the industry even with this coming down so i think we feel really good at what were doing and how were executing steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then just a question on the reserve whats the unemployment rate youre assuming in the total reserve and then i know you increased the reserve a bit you called out commercial real estate whats the reserve on the commercial real estate portfolio thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp were right around if you really look at the reserves steven theres four drivers there that we have the one that really impacted our increase in our allowance was really the crepi the change in the commercial real estate this quarter that went from a negative to the other three variables unemployment was around mid gdp was basically right around didnt change a whole lot and hpi was right at mid didnt change a lot so what really drove the change was the crepi on the allowance side steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it im sorry i missed it what was the specific reserve now on commercial real estate loans daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp the commercial real estate when the macro variable value that we used in the model went from to and if you look at the allowance the allowance we increase more to office overall we had decreases in hotel and multifamily mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it im still not following what the specific reserves is on cre but i can follow up with brian after thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i didnt hear that that well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp all right operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good luck with the new position for you and ditto on the slide deck to you brian and your colleagues it was its a very strong slide deck so thank you daryl can you share with us these proposals that were hearing about for basel iii end game may include banks as low as billion in assets and so when you guys talk about what could happen and then i believe earlier this week bloomberg had a story that there may be higher riskweighted asset assumptions for residential mortgages which seem to be a new twist to these capital requirements how are you guys approaching what could happen in terms of greater rwa increases for your organization and the capital needed to support them daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thanks for the question gerard obviously we are very eager to get these new rules and see whats out there and make comments thats going to go through the normal process there so its going to take time probably get most of these things implemented on your specific question of rwa and mortgages well wait and see how that comes out we are in the residential mortgage space we exited the correspondent space last quarter so were really just focusing on meeting the needs of our clients or the company and were basically selling all the conforming into the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 marketplace and were balance sheeting all of our wealth clients and clients that are low and moderate income are the ones that really are going on the balance sheet so were going to stay in our core businesses because were serving our clients if its a little bit higher capital the market will probably adjust and just raise pricing to accomodate for that would be my best guess from that as far as the other changes out there theres a lot of proposals there if its like longterm debt or tlac were waiting to see what that happens mt really we dont have a whole lot of debt outstanding so its something that we will have to just manage its probably going to be holding company if its not a holding company and indiscernible bank will probably end up with a mix of holding company and bank because you still want to have a strong parent company from a source of capital perspective there but well just optimize it but with us using now federal home loan bank advances broker deposits i think we have right now ability where we can pay those off issue unsecured debt and really not blow off the balance sheet from that and still have a really strong liquidity position from that so well wait and see i think our aoci comes in looks like thats coming in were basis points that basis points negative adjustment at the end of this quarter includes all three pieces its the afs securities cash flow hedges as well as pension thats probably one of the lowest that we have in the industry so its not a real big impact for us so thats the strength as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question you touched on and i may have missed some of this the charge offs in the quarter about some lower values for commercial real estate in a slide deck you guys put out earlier in the second quarter you gave some very detailed information about your commercial real estate portfolio by location and loan to values can you share with us where is is it the higher loan to values that were required to be written down or are you actually seeing it in some of the lower loan to values seeing some weakness as well and then second on top of that when you go through the portfolio where are you in terms of are you through reviewing the portfolio or or daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thank you for the question so on your first question cre is really just you have to look at it on a case bycase basis just because of the unique quality and pieces of how it is each borrower has different implications you have tenant things you have to market conditions interest rate so that is a casebycase basis so you really go through the deep dives there on your question on portfolio review yeah so we are 60plus percent through it all the loans that we have in the criticized bucket is reviewed every quarter we stress test those really well and if i look at what were doing versus my prior places i would say were doing as much if not more ph with what ive seen done in our credit process so were staying on top of this our teams are doing really well valuations are coming in and were doing the best we can with the information we have but i would say we feel good at where we are and were just continuing to monitor where everything is mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and good luck again in your new role thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp thanks gerard operator thank you well take our next question from brent erensel with portales partners brent erensel q analyst portales partners good morning and darryl welcome to western new york daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp thank you brent brent erensel q analyst portales partners so specifically on the cre drilling down to the manhattan real estate or new york city real estate i was wondering could you walk us through what you do you said you were taking chargeoffs there so do you take possession do you restructure what happens when you have a cre manhattan i guess its an office building what do you do here in that situation daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so in new york city new york city is a big marketplace and every place is a little bit different right now it seems like the downtown area might be a little weaker than the middle part of manhattan so the chargeoffs that we took in manhattan was in the downtown district there but i would say we do all the above i mean we really work with our clients it really for us starts from a client perspective client is really really important client selection and in the cre business we make loans in the larger cities like new york dc boston and in those markets i would say of those are very longterm oriented clients and really good clients once you get outside of these major market cities its almost all of our clients are really longterm oriented but as far as which notes we would sell or whatever its probably more of the financially oriented clients that we have where theyve had their returns and they are putting any more equity into the deals is really how we would handle that brent erensel q analyst portales partners to followup on that youre seeing stronghanded borrowers some of these big names just mailing in the keys are you experiencing that as well where your longterm stronghanded cre borrowers actually not so strong handed after all mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say what were seeing right now is our longterm clients it really comes on to client selection but theyre really holding in there you have to look at their portfolios that they have and they might have one troubled property but they have a lot of others that are really performing well and they move cash over to support and put equity into those transactions so we feel good about that and weve been in this business for a long time i get a lot of comfort when i look at bob and his team theres a lot of gray hair there theyve been through this many many times and gives me a lot of confidence and like i said earlier the processes were using are as good or better than what ive seen in the past brent erensel q analyst portales partners thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp ph hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc daryl a couple of clarifications if you dont mind so on the guide slide you talk about mid interest cumulative interestbearing betas i assume thats whats built into the low end of nii guide for the year and because in your comments you said low to mid so i would assume that if you ended up being in the low that would be kind of better so just clarifying whats in the guide i would assume its the mid thats on this slide daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think thats right and it does exclude broker we may pay off some of the broker deposits it really depends if we access the unsecured market or not so i would say if you look core i think thats the right assumption to use ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 and that was going to be my followup daryl so can you explain that just so broker deposit beta is completely outside of that mid beta comment daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so if you look this quarter our beta on total interestbearing deposits was and we issued billion of broker deposits during the quarter if we back out those broker deposits we were at deposit beta our decision to issue broker deposits was one versus looking at it from issuing doing federal home loan bank advances or doing unsecured debt we chose that as we move forward the treasury team will basically do whats best for the company and what we need to do and well probably use all three pieces and when it actually goes into deposits it impacts the deposit beta so we tried to give you excluding the broker piece what deposit beta is what darren said the last several quarters on deposit betas if you back out the broker hes spot on still where were performing so i mean the guide there we just kind of mixed it up by issuing these broker deposits ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood and then could you just tell us then so of i dont know a great way to think about billion of total interestbearing deposits just how much of that in aggregate is brokered daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp i think our broker deposits are about billion in total and i would say billion of it is cds and billion of it money market ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay i get it that helps thanks a lot daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah yeah youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey daryl good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning just to followup on kens question around broker so billion at the end of the quarter is there a target that the max that we should think about how much broker deposits can get either on a dollar basis or as a percentage of total deposits that we should keep in mind when were thinking about betas and the outlook there daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah probably just a few more billion from billion is probably as high as we want to go there so we dont want to be outsized in the use of that like anything else we want to be diversified and kind of use all of our funding tools just kind of you want to just make sure you have use them all and you have access to all of them so but id say a couple more billion is all were going to use in the broker space but you might actually see that come down if we issue more unsecured debt ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one followup on the cre appraisals i think if i heard you correctly you said you are through to of the portfolio how hard is it to get a true appraisal on a cre property right now and what im trying to get to is whats the risk of being blindsided on reserve levels two or three quarters from now where you need to take a lot more because of fair values and im just wondering the visibility on appraisals how conservative are you being as a bank in kind of trying to put this getting ahead of this issue daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thats a great question so what i would tell you is there arent a whole lot of sales in the marketplace right now so we dont even have a lot of specs when we do have them well use them but a lot of the valuations were using we use the discounted cash flow method and when we look at just a couple of pieces a discounted cash flow method when were looking at properties and the properties vacant we assume a 3year vacancy for it to get filled up when something is coming due and its turning over we assume a 12year vacancy or 12month vacancy so from a cash flow perspective were factoring in free amenities to get people in leases so all that cash flow ph adjusts in the discounted cash flow model so its really impacting the valuation that you have cap rates really havent changed a whole lot its really the assumptions youre using on the cash that youre generating in these properties is really whats driving down the values ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and welcome to the new role good to hear you audio gap call again thanks operator thank you well take our next question from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just daryl i missed the i know you talked about the back to sort of the noninterestbearing mix shift you talked about maybe a more normalized i guess sort of balance sheet getting cd balances ultimately back into the midteens is the best way to think about noninterestbearing shift from here is basically that all comes at the cost of noninterestbearing so that we could continue to see pretty significant shift ph add in non interest bearing because it seems like you could have some offsetting tailwinds from the trust business as well right as sort of the transactional volume maybe picks up or normalized so just wondering best way to think about where noninterestbearing balances could kind of migrate to daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think those are all great questions if you look at our noninterestbearing to total deposits this quarter we were at but if you actually back out the broker deposits that you put in there we were at so that here again broker is kind of playing something with the numbers from that perspective we probably have that going down though by the end of the year maybe or with the mix change that we have so i think from that corporate trust is definitely a great business for us its a business thats growing for us as market activity increases in that sector it will be a big contributor to our balances that we have on the noninterest bearing side so that is a really important piece right now the activity just is down some so theres a lot of market activity but right now were just giving an outlook for a couple quarters but as market activity picks up corporate trust will definitely be a big benefit for us in having that mix change frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just on the other side of the balance sheet back to the loan growth outlook and i guess consumers continuing to slow and balances maybe being down overall just on the ci side should that growth decelerate here as the floor deal planning stabilizes and ultimately where do you think cre kind of flushes out at or stabilizes in terms of total loans daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp right now if you look at our projections for total loans its relatively flat to maybe up slightly if you look specifically at the commercial side ci is growing this past quarter it was really driven by dealers floor planning as cars were getting on the lots some of our specialty businesses in fund or sponsor were kind of the growth areas there as you move forward i think cre were going to serve our clients in cre but with the businesses that we have some of it ph will we will basically went to them and ph sell it back out so thats more fee business so that overall business is going to become a smaller percentage of the balance sheet and ci will continue to be a larger percentage mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 on the consumer side its i think performing well we might do some asset sales or securitizations just to test the plumbing later this year so thats really impacting some of those balances if that actually happens frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp how are you doing mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc welcome to the north just big picture question i mean youve been in the midwest us bancorp and youve been in the south bbt and truist and now youre at mt just how do you view mt when you pull the lens back having been on the inside at so many different firms and so much perspective over a few decades why did you choose to go to mt what do you see as the potential thats not unrealized and what do you think that you can bring extra to the table which you probably brought up when you spoke to management daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah mike thank you for the question i would tell you first and foremost i am ecstatic to be here and to be part of the leadership team at mt i was actually my neighbor tracy one of my peers i walked into her office one evening and i told her i think its better than i expected it to be just the reception of the people and the work ethic and we run a really good company here and it is really performing well im just blessed to be on the team to try to continue ph at that performance to me it reminds me a lot of a bank thats getting larger and as we get larger you have to adjust to meet certain requirements and from regulations and basically actually running a larger company for me the big balance that we have to keep is the magic that happens out in the communities each and every day we empower our regional presidents and people to make decisions out in the field and really do a great job with client touch and how we serve clients and we want to make sure that that stays intact but running a larger company we also have to have controls and processes in place so we know whats going on and we can manage the risk as we continue to get larger so i think its just a balancing act from that perspective mike and i see a lot of opportunity where i think i can help us perform and get things in working better potentially as we kind of move forward just because were a bigger company i cant say i cant tell you how much the work ethic here just how well we run the company and everything we do a great job and it really starts with the community and are serving our clients and from that it mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 kind of all falls down working for rené somebody that ive really respected have known over the industry i would tell you is just a dream come true for me in my career so im very blessed to be here mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just one followup qualitatively i think that makes sense helping a bank manage through becoming bigger and all the regulatory and complexity that involves but if there was one quantitative metric where you say you know what three years from now or maybe five years from now this financial measure should be better and im going to take ownership of that what would that one financial metric be or maybe a couple daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say we have a good strong performance if you look at our investor deck and you look at our investor thesis our return on average tangible common equity at to is pretty darn good to do that consistently i think thats good if you get well over youre either growing too fast or taking more rest so you have to be careful for some of that so i think that would be a really good target we are really focused by how we run the company to really at the end of the day give a great return to our shareholders we are really prudent with how we manage our capital whether its through buybacks dividends are definitely key and acquisition the acquisitions we do and you just look at the peoples acquisition i mean we have great returns off that acquisition i went through some of the metrics earlier in my prepared remarks so thats going well and i would continue to see probably more acquisitions in our future over time its kind of in the pace of how we absorb it when you do these acquisitions it really takes us good two three four years to get the performance up to the mt standard so just buying peoples last year we probably dont expect peoples performance to really be at the mt performance until we get a couple of years under our belt there but as we grow into that we could have potentially other opportunities to do more of that over time so its good and it will continue to change and evolve as the industry changes but people here are fully dedicated to the mission everybody is all in and im just excited to be on the team mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey just one last question im sure everybody is hopping on to their oclock call but could you give us a sense of how you think if you are going to do billion in nii how is the cadence unfurls for the second half of the year more importantly what ph fourth quarter looks like and is the million impact on a down basis point scenario from your last q still sort of in the ballpark of your rate sensitivity to the downside daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 yeah let me start with the sensitivity question erika as we continue to look at our hedging strategies that we have in place and that we are continuing to operate on we are becoming less and less asset sensitive and right now when we if the fed increases one or two more times well get a little benefit out of it but what i use if you go up basis points and over a 12month period with that increase our net interest margin is probably only going to increase basis point or basis points because of that on the downside were getting less negatively impacted as we move forward such that if you go down basis points our deposit betas are not deposit betas our net interest margin is only going to go down basis points to basis points so its getting tighter and over time we just want to try to keep it as close to basis points i mean its a big balance sheet so you cant be exact but you want to be as close as you can and you dont really want to take a whole lot of rate risk and our treasury team is doing an awesome job in managing us through that as far as the guide goes right now with the funding pressures if you look at what we have rolling off or whats rolling in well probably have a little bit more pressure third quarter versus fourth quarter just because of the re pricing thats occurring on the liability side that said as things kind of normalize were starting to pick up spreads higher spreads on the asset side and if things stabilize on the liability side you could actually start to stabilize margin probably in the mid as you kind of embark but well see how that goes maybe next quarter when we look at and beyond but hopefully that helps erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc that really helps thanks daryl and look forward to working with you again daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thanks erika appreciate it operator thank you well take our last question from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning and congrats daryl in the new role just a couple of very quick things from me just on that nib noninterestbearing mix of did you audio gap where you believe it could bottom could it be below that youre around currently the level that you were prepandemic how much further below that could the noninterestbearing mix migrate daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i said earlier on another question john you may have missed it but we because of the broker deposits that we put on just putting those broker deposits on dilutes our percentages so you arent comparing applesto apples from that perspective but i would say were going to go down probably or the rest of this year it will be our best guess its really serving clients to have higher rates but what i said earlier we started from a really high place because weve got a lot of surplus deposits and we really have huge focus on getting primacy on the operating accounts and that basically gives us a lot to deal with and i think at the end of the day mt will still have one of the highest percentages of noninterestbearing to total mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 deposits of our peer group so i think its just playing out with just a higher rate of environment and that will change if rates start to go down at some point john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thank you and then lastly for me on the deposit side your outlook does imply modest growth in the second half of this year what is that primarily going to reflect is that a little bit of the incremental broker that you expect or maybe a little bit of color there daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah its not broker we really saw this quarter in the middle of the quarter start to stabilize and start to grow so were hopeful that well be able to get some growth out of our core businesses whether its retail business banking and commercial and maybe towards the end of the year maybe well get higher activity out of the capital markets area in our corporate trust space as well and wealth areas so im hoping that all those business lines will continue to modestly grow throughout the year as we compete for deposits john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah thanks john operator thank you at this time ill turn the floor back over to brian klock for any additional or closing remarks brian klock executive vice
