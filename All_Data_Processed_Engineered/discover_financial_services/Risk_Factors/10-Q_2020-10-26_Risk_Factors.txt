item risk factors in light of recent developments relating to the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic we are supplementing our risk factors disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the following risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described in our annual report on form 10k the covid19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the covid19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on a global scale as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the pandemic economic activity has declined both on a national and global level and unemployment has risen at a record pace and remains at historically high levels the depth and duration of this economic contraction is unknown and currently unpredictable federal and state governments and agencies have put in place programs to mitigate and respond to the impact of the pandemic these programs are in their early stages and it is too early to tell how successful these measures will be it is also unclear whether the measures employed to date are exhaustive or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional action that could impact our business the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting economic contraction has impacted and is expected to continue to adversely impact our financial results as consumers grow increasingly uncertain about the economy lose their jobs or are unable to find work due to the covid19 pandemic and the implementation of measures implemented to slow the spread of covid19 they may become increasingly unable or unwilling to repay their loans on time the duration of the pandemic and the measures to contain it and the longterm negative economic impact in relation to increased unemployment could lead to increased customer delinquencies and chargeoffs which would cause an increase to our allowance for credit losses which would adversely affect our profitability we had put various programs in place to assist effected borrowers during the pandemic the programs generally provided borrowers with flexibility to make monthly payments including allowing customers to skip payments without penalty or in certain cases accrual of interest the ultimate effect of these programs as well as federal stimulus programs on our credit losses will not be known for some time the impact on the us economy and the consumer credit environment may continue after the covid19 pandemic has subsided the pace of recovery is uncertain and unpredictable the resurgence of covid19 in areas where the pandemic previously appeared to have subsided or been contained only adds to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the pace of recovery additionally in connection with the economic contraction due to covid19 we have decreased our marketing activities which may adversely impact our ability to attract new customers and grow market share given the nature of the crisis our financial and economic models may be unable to accurately predict and respond to the impact of the economic contraction or lasting changes to consumer behaviors which in turn may limit our ability to manage credit risk and avoid higher chargeoff rates additionally due to the nature and novelty of the crisis our credit and economic models may not be able to adequately predict or forecast credit losses sales receivables or other financial metrics during and after the crisis which could result in our reserves being too large or insufficient for more information see the risk factor entitled our risk management framework and models for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating our risk of loss in our annual report on form 10k year ended december as governments have put measures in place to contain the pandemic by requiring all nonessential businesses to close andor their employees work from home and discouraging or prohibiting people generally from leaving their homes our sales volume credit card loan growth interchange revenue and nettonet volume have declined and may continue to do so even after such measures have been lifted the economic contraction and associated slowdown in travel and transaction volume may have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of some of our diners club international diners club franchises in the past we have extended financial support to franchises experiencing financial stress beginning march we have transitioned nearly all of our employees and nonemployee contractors to working from home previously only a small portion of employees worked primarily from a location other than one of our offices we have opened some of our physical locations with appropriate health safety measures and capacity limitations including our corporate headquarters however we have informed employees that they may continue to work from home and will not be required to return to our physical locations until june at the earliest as we continue to adapt to this new way of working it may become less effective and as a result our ability to design and implement new products services or features may be adversely impacted additionally in the event that a meaningful portion of our call center agents become ill due to covid19 or otherwise are unable to work effectively our ability to meet our internal measures for customer service may be adversely effected the pandemic has required us and our thirdparty vendors to activate certain business continuity programs and make ongoing adjustments to operations to the extent that these plans and backup servicing and other strategies and adjustments are either not available insufficient or cannot be implemented in whole or in part we may be exposed to legal regulatory reputational operational information security or financial risk for example if we are unable to send our customers certain required statements or disclosures due to disruptions in staffing and personnel or our backup servicing plans we may be exposed to legal and regulatory scrutiny finally while nearly all of our employees are working from home we are increasingly reliant on a handful of vendors including those we have no direct relationship with such as our employees internet service providers to maintain reliable high speed access to our internal network failure by such thirdparty providers would impact our operations efforts by us our vendors and their vendors to continue to adapt operations to this new environment may introduce additional vulnerabilities to our operations and information security programs and systems in ways we have not previously contemplated or otherwise prepared for there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak and the economic recovery following the containment of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the effects have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described in the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december
