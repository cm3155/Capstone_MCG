based on the current expectations of sales trends and recent account growth based on the current interest rate environment net interest margin is expected to increase modestly in comparison to with some variability from quarter to quarter we expect the total net chargeoffs rate to increase as credit continues to normalize from historically low levels in we remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable long term growth regulatory environment and developments covid19 economic recovery as the us and global economies continue to normalize from the covid19 pandemic the administration and banking agencies continue to evaluate whether additional actions are warranted to assist consumers financial institutions and the overall economy the impact of any further legislative and regulatory initiatives on our business the economy and the us consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified banking capital standards and stress testing as a bank holding company dfs is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve based on forwardlooking internal analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions dfs is also subject to capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments on january the federal reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and scb requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including dfs to be consistent with the federal reserves regulatory tailoring framework the final rules generally align to instructions the federal reserve previously provided to category iv firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions the amended rules also provide category iv firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the federal reserve to reset the stress test portion of their scb requirement in connection with the final rulemaking the federal reserve revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework however the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain on june the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its supervisory stress tests for the firms required to participate in the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process in accordance with the capital plan rule amendments that were finalized in january dfs elected not to participate in the supervisory stress tests nevertheless dfs was required to submit a capital plan based on a forwardlooking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions the federal reserve thereafter used our capital plan submission to assess its capital planning process and positions and as of august announced dfs adjusted scb requirement of to reflect dfs planned common stock dividends this adjusted scb is effective through october discover was a full participant in the ccar process and submitted the capital plan to the federal reserve before the april due date london interbank offered rate on july the uk financial conduct authority fca announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the london interbank offered rate libor after to support a smooth transition away from libor the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee arrc a group of privatemarket participants tasked with facilitating a successful transition from us dollar usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc initially identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative reference rate for usd libor the arrc has also established several priorities and milestones to support the use of sofr and sofrbased indices including developing contractual fallback language for capital markets and consumer products providing clarity on legal tax accounting and regulatory matters promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the libor transition and recommending spread adjustments for sofr and sofrbased indices which will be of critical importance to market participants once usd libor settings cease in with regard to recent libor transition developments on march the fca announced the future cessation and loss of representativeness for all libor benchmark settings while nonusd and several less frequently referenced usd libor settings ceased publication immediately after december commonly referenced usd libor settings will cease publication immediately after june this future cessation event will trigger fallback provisions in many financial contracts to convert their benchmark index from libor to an alternative rate on july the arrc announced its recommendation of forwardlooking term rates based on sofr as additional alternative reference rate options on december the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb finalized a rule to facilitate transition from libor which is effective april specifically this final rule provides guidance on libor replacements and the libor transition for purposes of regulation z we have been communicating with the cfpb regarding our plans for the libor transition a crossfunctional team is overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of libor this team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for liborindexed instruments evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of libor publication and oversees and takes actions to transition our libor exposures to alternative benchmark rates usually sofr our existing libor exposures are limited primarily to two instrumentsvariablerate student loans and capital markets securities as of march liborindexed variablerate loans comprised approximately of our private student loan portfolio and approximately of our aggregate loan portfolio these outstanding student loans indexed to libor will convert to a sofr index in when 3month usd libor will no longer be published us banking regulators have directed banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate after december therefore as of november we no longer originate new variablerate student loans indexed to libor instead new originations of such loans are indexed solely to 3month term sofr published by the chicago mercantile exchange we ceased entering into new liborindexed interest rate derivatives in and have since actively reduced libor exposures in our derivatives portfolio during the third quarter of we terminated our last liborindexed interest rate swap maturing after june our one remaining liborindexed interest rate swap matured in january most of our capital markets securities indexed to usd libor are floatingrate assetbacked securities beginning in we included fallback provisions in all newly issued securities that will facilitate an orderly transition from libor to an appropriate reference rate which may be based on sofr once and 3month libor cease to be published after june approximately billion of our capital markets securities that mature after june with no fallback provisions would be covered under new york libor legislation enacted in april or federal legislation enacted in march which preempts the new york libor legislation this legislation would allow us to replace the libor index with sofr under a safe harbor provision approximately million of our capital markets securities have a rate reset in august that contains a fallback provision that may not be covered under the new york libor legislation or the federal legislation however we may decide to exercise our right to call and redeem those securities on their reset date we have prepared for the cessation of usd libor by taking steps to avoid new exposures and actively reduce our remaining exposures we completed scheduled transition work before yearend including providing our stakeholders with information about the cessation of usd libor and how it will affect their contracts with us the transition process will continue through the end of consumer financial services the cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services including discover the cfpbs authority includes rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws preventing unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap and ensuring that consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive financial products and services historically the cfpbs policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer eg credit cards and other consumer lending products in addition the cfpb is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market under director rohit chopras leadership the cfpbs priorities have focused on and are expected to continue focusing on among other things increased enforcement of existing consumer protection laws with a particular focus on fees charged to consumers udaap and fair lending student lending and servicing debt collection and credit reporting additionally detection of repeat offenders such as companies that violate a formal court or agency order has become a top priority for the cfpb in remarks by director chopra in march he identified as repeat offenders several companies that have had multiple enforcement actions including us the cfpb has recently taken action against financial institutions for violating prior enforcement actions enhanced regulatory requirements potential supervisory findings or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our ability to implement certain consumerfocused enhancements to product features and functionality and business strategies limit or change our business practices limit our consumer product offerings cause us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals the additional expense time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations in december certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the cfpb regarding identified private student loan servicing practices see note litigation and regulatory matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information data security and privacy policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements furthermore regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards the california consumer privacy act ccpa creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the european unions general data protection regulation the ccpa went into effect on january and the california attorney generals final regulations became effective on august with enforcement beginning july the california privacy rights act cpra a ballot measure led by the original proponent of the ccpa passed on november and largely enters into force on january the cpra replaces the ccpa to enhance consumer privacy protections further and creates a new california privacy protection agency cppa in september the cppa board initiated the cpra regulatory phase by issuing a request for preliminary comments while the cpra retains an exemption for information collected processed sold or disclosed subject to the grammleachbliley act we continue to evaluate the impact of the cpra on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services environmental social and governance matters environmental social and governance esg issues including climate change human capital and governance practices are a significant area of focus by lawmakers regulatory agencies shareholders and other stakeholders proposed legislation and rulemakings have been issued or are being considered including proposals to require disclosure of climate cybersecurity and other esg metrics and risk the potential impact to us of these legislative and regulatory developments is uncertain at this time in particular in march the securities and exchange commission proposed climaterelated disclosure requirements through an enterprisewide working group we are assessing the potential impact of the proposed rules if adopted segments we manage our business activities in two segments digital banking and payment services

interest income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily driven by a higher average level of loan receivables and lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on loans interest income increased during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in this increase was due to a higher average level of card loan receivables as well as favorable interest chargeoffs partially offset by a lower card revolve rate interest expense decreased during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to a lower funding base and higher coupon maturities for the three months ended march the overall portfolio provision for credit losses increased as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to lower reserve releases in the current period compared to the prior period partially offset by favorable net chargeoffs the reserve release during the three months ended march was primarily driven by the continued strength of the loan portfolios credit performance the reserve release during the three months ended march was primarily driven by a reduction in loan receivables outstanding continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast for a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses see loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses total other income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in which was due to increases in net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income the increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs both of which were the result of higher sales volume loan fee income increased primarily due to higher late fees total other expense increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to increases in marketing and business development and information processing and communications marketing and business development increased primarily due to investments in card acquisition the increase in information processing and communications was driven by investments in infrastructure and analytics discover card sales volume was billion for the three months ended march which was an increase of as compared to the same period in this volume growth was primarily driven by higher consumer spending across all spending categories reflecting the easing of covid19 restrictions continued economic expansion and residual effects of government stimulus programs payment services our payment services segment reported a pretax loss of million for the three months ended march as compared to pretax income of million for the same period in the decrease in segment pretax income for the three months ended march was primarily driven by unrealized losses on equity investments unrealized losses on equity investments are the result of investments in payment services entities that are carried at fair value because the shares are actively traded these unrealized losses were partially offset by realized gains on equity investments related to sales during the period critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain cases could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses was approximately billion at march which reflects a million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet loan commitments changes in the allowance for credit losses and in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in estimating the expected credit losses we use a combination of statistical models and qualitative analysis there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to estimate the allowance for credit losses for more information on these judgments and our accounting policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loan quality note loan receivables and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december one of the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in estimating the current expected credit losses cecl on a quarterly basis is the determination of the macroeconomic forecasts used in the loss forecast models for the reasonable and supportable loss forecast period we consider forecasts of multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with one or more optimistic upside or pessimistic downside scenarios these scenarios incorporate a variety of macroeconomic variables including annualized gross domestic product growth and unemployment rate the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are inherently uncertain and as a result actual changes in the allowance for credit losses may be different from the simulated scenario presented below to demonstrate the sensitivity of the estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared the modeled credit losses determined using our base and one or more adverse macroeconomic scenarios our allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately million at march if we applied weight to the most adverse scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the economic deterioration from covid19 and resulting economic stress as well as increasing inflationary pressures including the influence of geopolitical events the sensitivity disclosed above is hypothetical it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input such as the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses the macroeconomic scenarios used are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses the inputs in the macroeconomic scenarios may not change at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others as a result the sensitivity analysis above does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses it is intended to provide insights into the impact of different judgments about the economy on our modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and does not imply any expectation of future losses furthermore the hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current allowance for credit losses which may have a positive or negative effect on our actual financial condition and results of operations the overall economic environment directly impacts the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently during the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them earnings summary the following table outlines changes in our condensed consolidated statements of income dollars in millions for the three months ended march vs increase decrease interest income

interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and brokered and longterm borrowings including amounts owed to securitization investors the following factors influence net interest income the level and composition of loan receivables including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates the credit performance of our loans particularly with regard to chargeoffs of finance charges which reduce interest income the terms of longterm borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering including maturity and interest rate the interest rates necessary to attract and maintain directtoconsumer deposits the level and composition of other interestearning assets including our liquidity portfolio and interestbearing liabilities changes in the interest rate environment including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices such as the prime rate the federal funds rate the interest rate on reserve balances and libor and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program net interest income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily driven by a higher average level of loan receivables and lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on loans interest income increased during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in this increase was due to a higher average level

the covid19 pandemic on the loan portfolio the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the economy have significantly affected our sales volume and credit card loan growth we tightened credit standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products and reduced our marketing and customer acquisition expenditures at the onset of the pandemic recognizing the strong economic recovery from the covid19 pandemicinduced recession we returned most of our underwriting criteria to prepandemic standards and resumed our investment in marketing and business development during the second quarter of this change in our credit underwriting in addition to changes in consumer spending behavior increased marketing and the reopening of the us economy upon expiration of certain covid19 containment measures contributed to an increase in sales volume for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in our outstanding loan receivables as of march decreased when compared to december due to seasonality of our credit card portfolio troubled debt restructuring tdr program balances and the number of accounts reported as tdrs were favorably impacted by accounting

or after january are not eligible for this exemption the number and balance of new credit card private student and personal loan modifications decreased during the three months ended march when compared to total modifications including both tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation in the same period in the decrease is primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs which reduced the need for our customers to enroll in a loan modification program additionally enrollments in personal loan modification programs were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that we implemented in early the following table provides the number of accounts that exited a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation

on modification programs tdrs and the allowance for credit losses loan receivables consist of the following dollars in millions march december credit card loans other loans private student loans personal loans other loans total other loans total loan receivables allowance for credit losses net loan receivables provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be chargedoff establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and

adjustment of the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months ended march and respectively as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the allowance for credit losses was approximately billion at march which reflects a million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the release in the allowance for credit losses between march and december was primarily driven by the continued strength of our loan portfolios credit performance in estimating the allowance at march we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected i a peak unemployment rate of decreasing to and through the end of and respectively and ii and annualized growth in the real gross domestic product for and respectively labor market conditions which historically have been an important determinant of credit loss trends continued to improve as of march the unemployment rate and continuing jobless claims returned to prepandemic levels during the first quarter of and the number of job openings reached nearrecord levels reflecting robust demand for labor as the us economy continues to expand postpandemic in estimating expected credit losses we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs and disaster relief programs as well as higher consumer price inflation experienced in the first quarter of and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation the federal reserve raised its benchmark federal funds rate in march and signaled additional rate hikes in in recognition of the evolving macroeconomic environment the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months for all periods presented the 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate based on the observed stability of the economic outlook and relative consistency among the macroeconomic forecasts for all periods presented we determined that a reversion period of months was appropriate for similar reasons due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus disaster relief programs and fiscal and monetary policies we applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three months ended march the provision for credit losses increased by million or compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to lower reserve releases in the current period compared to the prior period partially offset by favorable net chargeoffs the reserve release during the three months ended march was primarily driven by the continued strength of the loan portfolios credit performance the reserve release during the three months ended march was primarily driven by a reduction in loan receivables outstanding continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended march credit card loans private student loans personal loans the net chargeoffs and net charge off rates for credit card and personal loans decreased for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in primarily due to higher payment rates periodoverperiod which decreased the rate of delinquent loans and average balances chargedoff the higher payment rates periodoverperiod reflect the improvement in household cash flows aided by government stimulus and disaster relief programs that were extended near the end of the first quarter of the net chargeoff rate for credit cards also benefited from higher average outstanding loan receivables periodoverperiod the net chargeoffs and net chargeoff rate for personal loans continue to benefit from tighter underwriting standards that we implemented in early the net chargeoffs and net charge off rate for private student loans increased for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily driven by the normalization of credit as the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs began to wane delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days

days delinquent at march and december included million and million respectively in modified loans exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act within private student and personal loans that were or more days delinquent at march and december the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act were immaterial we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs we estimate this amount by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms we estimate this amount by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million at march and december which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million at march and december which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day and 90day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans including tdrs modified loans exempt from tdr status and prior modifications that are no longer required to be reported as tdrs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for our credit card and private student loans at march increased compared to december this increase was primarily driven by the normalization of credit as the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs began to wane the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for our personal loans at march remained relatively flat compared to december the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans benefited from tighter underwriting standards that we implemented in early and were partially offset by a decrease in outstanding loan receivables periodoverperiod the balance of credit card and private student loans reported as tdrs increased at march compared to december primarily due to enrollments in loan modification programs that are no longer exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act the balance of personal loans reported as tdrs decreased at march compared to december due to the impact of tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early resulting in a lower balance of personal loans entering into our loan modification programs partially offset by enrollments in loan modification programs that are no longer exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act to provide additional clarity with respect to credit card loans classified as tdrs the table above presents loans that are currently enrolled in modification programs separately from loans that have exited those programs but retain that classification the following table provides the balance of loan receivables restructured through a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act dollars in millions march december credit card loans private student loans personal loans we believe loan modification programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial

income total other income net of rewards including cashback bonus rewards of million and million for the three months ended march and respectively total other income decreased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to unrealized losses on equity investments offset by increases in net discount and interchange revenue loan fee income and realized gains on equity investments the unrealized losses on equity investments are the result of investments in payment services entities that are carried at fair value because the shares are actively traded the increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs both of which were the result of higher sales volume loan fee income increased primarily due to higher

pandemic on liquidity and capital the us recorded strong real gdp growth during as it recovered from a brief but severe recession in caused by responses to the covid19 pandemic labor market conditions have also improved considerably as the unemployment rate has returned to low prepandemic levels favorable labor market conditions have generated strong wage growth and sustained consumer spending however strong economic recovery and geopolitical events have contributed to higher inflation prompting the federal reserve to alter its monetary policy which may slow economic growth in the coming quarters in the meantime we maintain ample capital and liquidity to meet our customers loan demands and respond to contingency requirements should the need arise we exercised prudent stewardship of our liquidity and deposit balances which grew rapidly at the onset of the pandemic since we retained most of these new deposits we curtailed our wholesale funding activity while our loan receivable growth remained modest credit spreads which had tightened to near recordlow levels during have widened during in response to higher financial market volatility nevertheless we maintain good access to the capital markets and issued billion of credit card assetbacked securities during the first quarter of before credit spreads widened materially funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a portfolio composed of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations and federal home loan bank fhlb advances in addition we have unused borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira savings accounts ira certificates of deposit and checkingdebit accounts brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts in december the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued the final rule on revisions to its brokered deposits regulation in accordance with this final rule our regulatory reporting reflects the changes required to deposit categorizations specifically certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships will no longer be categorized as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes at march we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits of which there are billion of deposit balances due in less than one year and billion of deposit balances due in one year or thereafter credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in public and private transactions which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holding the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at march we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended march the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our wholly owned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritizationrelated contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of march there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended march alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries dollars in millions at march total less than one year one year and thereafter scheduled maturities of borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date have been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december however other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future federal home loan bank advances discover bank is a member bank of the fhlb of chicago one of fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the fhlb system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the us us gses chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as us treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for shortterm contingent liquidity and longterm assetliability management as a member of the fhlb of chicago discover bank has access to short and longterm advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to years at march we had total committed borrowing capacity of billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged none of which was drawn under certain stressed conditions we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value other longterm borrowingsprivate student loans at march million of principal was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of the student loan corporation principal and interest payments on the underlying private student loans will reduce the

the event of a change of control involving us and corresponding ratings downgrade below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highly rated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or us gses at march there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additionally we have access to shortterm advance structures through the fhlb of chicago and privately placed assetbacked securitizations at march there were no advances outstanding from the fhlb or private assetbacked securitizations additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs at march we had a total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn we seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of march discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans as of march we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit to customers primarily through discover bank the maintenance of sufficient working capital for routine operations the service of our debt and capital obligations including interest principal and dividend payments and the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio in addition to originating consumer loans to new customers we also extend credit to existing customers which primarily arises from agreements for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement at march our unused credit arrangements were approximately billion these arrangements substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements are periodically reviewed based on account usage customer creditworthiness and loan qualification in the normal course of business we enter into various contracts for goods and services such as consulting outsourcing data sponsorships software licenses telecommunications global merchant acceptance and cashback rewards among other things these contracts are legally binding and specify all significant terms including any applicable fixed future cash payments as of march we have debt obligations common stock and preferred stock outstanding refer to funding sources and capital for more information related to our debt obligations and capital service respectively and the timing of expected payments we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid ie idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity if we determine we have excess cash and cash equivalents we may invest in highly liquid unencumbered assets that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using the repo market or outright

funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset

liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the board of directors approves the policy and the asset and liability management committee the alco is responsible for its implementation additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document that outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress the alco chaired by our treasurer has crossfunctional membership and manages liquidity risk centrally the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed according to regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we could borrow fhlb advances by pledging securities to the fhlb of chicago moreover we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at march our liquidity portfolio is composed of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the federal reserve investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and us gses and residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs issued by us government agencies or us gses these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based on the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management objectives at march our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which is billion

of idiosyncratic or systemic stress the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets in addition our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from discover bank to the bank holding company we utilize a measure referred to as number of months of prefunding to determine the length of time dfs can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources in managing this metric we structure our debt maturity schedule to manage prudently the amount of debt maturing within a short period see note longterm borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support our businesses growth account for their risks and meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum capital levels failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as those related to the adoption of the cecl accounting model may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic respectively under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules under the basel iii rules dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities as they are us banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios on march federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim and now final rule that allows banks that have implemented the cecl accounting model to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule after that period of deferral the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over three years beginning in electing this option raised our common equity tier cet1 capital ratios in and the phasein of the cecl accounting model decreased cet1 by million as of january for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements on march the federal reserve announced the scb final rule which imposes limitations on dfs capital distributions if we do not maintain our riskbased capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests under this rule dfs is required to assess whether our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distribution limitations that will apply on a proforma basis throughout the planning horizon the scb requirement is institutionspecific and is calculated as the greater of i and ii the sum of a the difference between dfs actual cet1 ratio at the beginning of the forecast and the projected minimum cet1 ratio based
