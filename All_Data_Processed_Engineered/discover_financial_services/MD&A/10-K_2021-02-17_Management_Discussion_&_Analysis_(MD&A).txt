item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on s policy changes and forecasting uncertainties given the same information others may reach different reasonable estimates the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts generally a straightline method is used to revert from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the postreversion period but in certain stressed scenarios a weighted approach may be deemed more appropriate the specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness unemployment personal income and housingrelated metrics the overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently under the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them see loan quality and note loan

assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interestearning assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and brokered and longterm borrowings including amounts owed to securitization investors net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates the credit performance of our loans particularly with regard to chargeoffs of finance charges which reduce interest income the terms of longterm borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering including maturity and interest rate the interest rates necessary to attract and maintain directtoconsumer deposits the level and composition of other interestearning assets including our liquidity portfolio and interestbearing liabilities changes in the interest rate environment including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices such as the prime rate the federal funds rate interest rate on excess reserves and london interbank offered rate libor and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program net interest income decreased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december primarily driven by lower yields and lower volume on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs interest income decreased over the prior year primarily due to lower yields on credit cards loans which was the result of lower market rates and lower volume interest expense decreased compared to the prior year due to lower average market rates and lower funding costs average balance sheet

loan quality the covid19 pandemic and its impact to the economy has had a significant effect on our sales volume and credit card loan growth during while we continue to lend to customers we have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in response to the covid19 pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to include skipapay payment deferral and other loan modification programs complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs the accounts using these modifications as a result of the pandemic impact were evaluated for potential exclusion from tdr status either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for exemption pursuant to the cares act while we continue to support and provide assistance to all customers impacted by the covid19 pandemic we are no longer offering enrollments in the skipapay payment deferral programs or loan modifications developed specifically for covid19 as of august while the skipapay payment deferral programs were active we enrolled approximately thousand customers and billion in receivables in total as of december accounts actively enrolled in the skipapay payment deferral programs were immaterial the skipapay payment deferral programs provided only an insignificant delay in payment on the enrolled accounts or loans and therefore those deferrals were not classified as tdrs the utilization of these skipapay payment deferral programs had a favorable impact on reported credit performance because pursuant to regulatory guidelines accounts enrolled in the skipapay payment deferral programs did not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as would have occurred without the programs specifically current accounts enrolled in the skipapay payment deferral programs did not advance to delinquency and delinquent accounts enrolled in the skipapay payment deferral programs did not advance to the next delinquency cycle or to chargeoff this impact was most pronounced in the second quarter of when the skipapay payment deferral programs were initially offered the impact dissipated as enrollments tapered off significantly after the initial months of the covid19 pandemic by the fourth quarter of there was no material impact to delinquencies from these payment deferrals since delinquent loans were advancing through the delinquency cycles or to chargeoff as appropriate after these payment deferrals ceased being offered additionally certain customer accounts entering loan modification programs during the pandemic were excluded from being reported as tdrs due to relief provided by the cares act as a result fewer loan modifications were reported as tdrs at december than otherwise would have been the payment status of modified accounts excluded from tdr status pursuant to the cares act is reflected in our delinquency reporting the table below reflects both the new loan modifications reported as tdrs and the amount of new loan modifications excluded from tdr classification as a result of the cares act dollars in millions table start for the year ended december

january or the date that is days after the termination of the national emergency declared by the president of the united states of america on march under the national emergencies act related to the outbreak of covid19 as such reported tdrs are expected to remain lower than they otherwise would have been our estimate of expected loss reflected in our allowance for credit losses includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications including tdrs loan modifications exempt from tdr status under the cares act and skipapay payment deferral programs despite the lower delinquency and tdr trends we have seen in we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses since the adoption of cecl on january the increases in the allowance for credit losses during are indicative of the deterioration in consumer credit we expect related to the pandemic the yeartodate build in the allowance of billion which includes the billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl is largely attributable to card loans but includes increases associated with all loan products labor markets historically indicative of trends in credit losses have been significantly stressed by the covid19 pandemic with unemployment reaching levels that are elevated by historical standards the higher allowance for credit losses reflects our view of this economic impact on our customers refer to note

end prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit loss we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries that were either previously chargedoff or are expected to be chargedoff establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements the level and direction of historical losses and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses refer to critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses on loan receivables and note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements the following tables provide changes in our allowance for credit losses dollars in millions table start

change to earnings net change in reserves on pcd pools having no remaining nonaccretable difference prior to adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was billion at december which reflects a billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance build across all loan products was due to i a billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl on january and ii a billion build that primarily reflects an economic outlook that included the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic stress in estimating the allowance at december we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected i a peak unemployment rate of recovering to by the end of 2021with slow recovery over the next few years and ii a growth in gross domestic product in we also considered the uncertainties associated with some of the assumptions used in the macroeconomic forecast including the amount and timing of additional government stimulus furthermore the estimate contemplated the impact of previous government stimulus programs and other loan modification programs on borrower payment trends the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy continues to cause uncertainty in assumptions surrounding factors such as length and depth of economic stresses and longer term impacts on borrower behavior which has required significant management judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months for all periods since the adoption of cecl except for the estimate as of march the decrease to months as of march was due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic the return to an 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was based on the view that the present macroeconomic conditions will last for a longer period than previously expected the reversion period was months for all quarters since the adoption of cecl during the first quarter of a straightline method was used to revert to appropriate historical information in the second quarter of the high degree of economic stress led us to apply a weighted reversion method for credit card loans that puts more emphasis on the loss forecast model rather than lower historical losses for similar reasons we determined it was appropriate to apply a weighted reversion method for all loans in the third and fourth quarter the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the year ended december the provision for credit losses increased by billion or as compared to the year ended december the provision for credit losses was determined under separate methodologies for these two periods based on the timing of the adoption of asu no on january however the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant adverse change in economic outlook due to the covid19 pandemic net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while net fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions table start for the years ended december credit card loans private student loans personal loans table end prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings the net chargeoffs on credit card loans for the year ended december decreased when compared to the year ended december due to decreased loan receivables government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoffs on private student loans for the year ended december decreased when compared to the year ended december due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoffs on personal loans for the year ended december decreased when compared to the year ended december due to improved underwriting government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoff rate on our credit card loans remained relatively flat for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december as a result of the decrease in receivables yearoveryear offset by the impact of improved underwriting government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoff rate on our private student loans decreased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoff rate on our personal loans decreased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december due to improved underwriting and the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table

under the cares act within private student loans and personal loans that were or more days delinquent at december the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from tdr status under the cares act were immaterial we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million million million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs this amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million million million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms this amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million million million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million million million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent prior to the adoption of asu no on january no modifications of pcd loans were accounted for as tdrs personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million million million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day and 90day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans including tdrs modified loans exempt from tdr status and prior modifications which are no longer required to be reported as tdrs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for credit card loans at december decreased as compared to december primarily due to government stimulus and disaster relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans decreased at december compared to december as a result of improved underwriting government stimulus and disaster relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for student loans decreased at december compared to december due to government stimulus and disaster relief programs the balance of credit card loans reported as tdrs decreased at december as compared to december due to customer usage of loan modification programs subject to tdr exclusion pursuant to the cares act as well as the exclusion of customer accounts that had previously been classified as a tdr for which the account has been subsequently restructured to a market interest rate and the customer has demonstrated financial stability as of december there were approximately billion or of credit card loan receivables currently enrolled in a loan modification program that were exempt from tdr designation pursuant to the cares act to provide additional clarity with respect to credit card loans classified as tdrs the table above presents loans that are currently enrolled in modification programs separately from loans that have exited those programs but retain that classification the balance of private student and personal loans reported as tdrs increased at december as compared to december due to increased awareness and utilization of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties meeting their payment obligations offset by customer usage of loan modification programs subject to tdr exclusion pursuant to the cares act as of december there were approximately million and million or and of private student and personal loan receivables respectively restructured through a loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act we believe loan modification programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and help to prevent defaults we plan to continue to use loan modification programs as a means to provide relief to customers experiencing temporary financial difficulties see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of loan modification

credit card loans private student loans personal loans other loans total loan portfolio table end because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments historically actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and therefore the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our

of billion billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively total other income decreased million for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december which was primarily driven by a decrease in discount and interchange revenue other income and loan fee income partially offset by gains on equity investments net discount and interchange revenue decreased as a result of a decline in sales volume due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic other income decreased due to a nonrecurring writedown of certain real estate facilities loan fee income decreased primarily due to lower late fees and cash advance fees gains on equity investments increased primarily from sales during the year other expense the following table represents the components of other expense dollars in

professional fees premises and equipment other expense total other expense table end total other expense increased million for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december the increase was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits information processing and communications and other expense employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher average salaries a larger headcount base and a voluntary early retirement program which was initiated in the fourth quarter of the increase in information processing and communications was due to nonrecurring software writeoffs and investments in infrastructure the increase in other expense was primarily due to a covid19 related noncash impairment charge on the diners club business in the second quarter of and charges for penalties and restitution in connection with the student loan business this was offset by a decrease in marketing costs due to covid19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card income tax expense the following table reconciles our effective tax rate to the united states federal statutory income tax rate table start for the years ended december

expense table end for the year ended december income tax expense decreased million or and the effective income tax rate decreased percentage points percent as compared to the year ended december the decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by a decrease in pretax income the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to tax credits having a higher rate benefit on lower pretax income liquidity and capital resources impact of covid19 on liquidity and capital we entered the covid19 pandemic in march with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources our reserves of highquality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt while certain wholesale funding markets experienced disruptions and wider credit spreads particularly during the second quarter of moreover our directtoconsumer deposit balance increased substantially during the second and third quarters of as investors sought safehaven assets consequently our cash and other liquid assets balances have increased materially since the onset of the pandemic curtailing our need for wholesale funding we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain of note we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock through the end of took actions to reduce our exposures to higherrisk segments of our credit portfolio and issued preferred stock during the second quarter of we have also completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain ample amounts of both to ensure we remain wellcapitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it the united states economy is recovering from a severe recession as a result of the covid19 pandemic considerable uncertainty exists about the path of recovery as the virus continues to spread throughout the united states while vaccines are not yet widely available as a result we plan to maintain prudent liquid asset and capital buffers as long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other short and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and investment securities and secured borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations and federal home loan bank advances in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at december we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered and other deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions through dcent which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at december we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended december the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add additional receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of december there were billion of credit card receivables in dcmt and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the year ended december alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions table start at december total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors table end the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date has been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future federal home loan bank advances during the fourth quarter of discover bank became a member bank of the federal home loan bank of chicago one of federal home loan banks fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the federal home loan bank system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the united states of america chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as united states treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs enjoy consistent capital markets access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for both normal and contingency purposes we intend to pledge our home loans to the federal home loan bank of chicago and periodically borrow advances against them under certain stressed conditions we could also pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value other longterm borrowingsstudent loans at december million of remaining

in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as united states treasury bills or notes or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures at december there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at december we had total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them in operational tests and for seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of december discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade discover bank would be required to post additional collateral which would have been million as of december dfs parent company had no outstanding derivatives as of december and therefore no collateral was required in light of the covid19 pandemic rating agencies have cited their expectation that the banking industry will experience heightened loan delinquencies and chargeoffs given recent deterioration in the labor market during the second quarter of moodys standard and poors and fitch ratings affirmed our credit ratings standard and poors and fitch changed

operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against at the federal home loan bank of chicago and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at december our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve and united states treasury bills shortterm investments were primarily comprised of united states treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than days but less than one year at the time of acquisition investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the united states treasury and residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs issued by united states government housing agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management policies for instance our liquidity portfolio grew materially during as our customer deposits increased and our loan balances declined reflecting consumers response to the covid19 pandemic at december our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which was billion higher than the balance at december during the year ended december and the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was and billion and billion respectively

additional funding sources for additional information bank holding company liquidity the primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated dfs level include debt service obligations interest payments and return of principal and capital service and management activities which include dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities as well as dividends from our subsidiaries particularly discover bank under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets in addition our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from discover bank to the bank holding company we utilize a measure referred to as number of months of prefunding to determine the length of time discover financial services can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources in prudently managing this metric we structure our debt maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time see note longterm borrowings to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum levels of capital failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and operating results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as the impacts of cecl may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic to implement the provisions under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios under basel iii rules for regulatory capital dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities defined as united states banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion as of january thresholds within the basel iii rules are fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulations issued in november pursuant to a final rule issued in july the transition provisions that were previously frozen will be replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below additionally on march federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim and now final rule that allows banks that have implemented cecl the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule after that period of deferral the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over a threeyear period beginning in we estimate that electing this option raised our common equity tier cet1 capital ratios in for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements on march the federal reserve announced the scb final rule which imposes limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests we participated in the ccar supervisory stress test in and received our scb of which primarily reflects the difference between our actual cet1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of and our projected minimum cet1 ratio based on the federal reserves models in its ninequarter severely adverse stress scenario the scb became effective october under this rule we are required to assess whether our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a proforma basis throughout the planning horizon in december the federal reserve notified discover bank and other large banks that it reserves the right to recalculate their scbs based on the results of the most recent round of capital stress tests if it chooses to exercise this right the federal reserve will notify those banks of its intent by march see regulatory environment and developments banking capital standards and stress testing for additional information the basel iii rules provide for certain thresholdbased deductions from and adjustments to cet1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of cet1 in july federal banking regulators issued a final rule that among other things revised certain capital requirements for standardized approach banks by raising the of cet1 deduction threshold for certain items to and eliminating the combined deduction threshold applying to these items these changes became effective for all standardized approach banking institutions in april basel iii rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline this series of disclosures is commonly referred to as pillar the objective is to increase transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations we are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure capital adequacy risk exposures and riskweighted assets we make the pillar disclosures publicly available on our website in a report called basel iii regulatory capital disclosures at december dfs and discover bank met the requirements for wellcapitalized status under regulation y and the prompt corrective action rules respectively exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules additionally we are subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the federal reserve as part of its stress testing framework and ccar program refer to regulatory environment and developments for more information we disclose tangible common equity which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles management believes that common

pandemicinduced economic recession the federal reserve required us along with all other ccar firms to prepare and submit a second capital plan in november in response to another capital stress test reflecting macroeconomic conditions since the covid19 outbreak we received the results of that second capital plan in december in conjunction with those results the federal reserve extended certain limits on the capital distribution of ccar banks as discussed below we recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share payable on march to holders of record on february which is consistent with the quarterly amount paid throughout in light of the current economic downturn the federal reserve required all large banks participating in the ccar supervisory stress tests to cap common stock dividends at the lower of the prior quarters dividend or the average of a firms net income over the preceding four quarters we also recently declared a semiannual cash dividend on our series c and series d preferred stock the series c preferred stock pays a dividend of per share equal to per depositary share payable on april to holders of record on april which is consistent with the amount paid in the second and fourth quarters of and the series d preferred stock pays a dividend of per share equal to per depositary share payable on march to holders of record on march the

january our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to billion of share repurchases the program expires on december our decision to repurchase shares of common stock will depend on our financial results prevailing and expected economic conditions potential regulatory limitations and other considerations for example the federal reserve is currently restricting ccar banks from paying common stock dividends and share repurchases that would exceed an amount equal to the average of a firms net income over the preceding four calendar quarters share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods including open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or other purchases including block trades accelerated share repurchase transactions or any combination of such methods having suspended share repurchases early in in recognition of the pandemicinduced economic downturn we repurchased no common stock during the three months ended december during the year ended december we repurchased approximately million shares or of our outstanding common stock as of december for million the amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations financial condition capital levels cash requirements future prospects and other factors such as the impact of cecl the declaration and payment of future dividends as well as the amount thereof are subject to the discretion of our board of directors holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period in addition as noted above banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases including limitations on the extent to which our banking subsidiary can provide funds to us through dividends loans or otherwise further current or future regulatory reforms may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or
