a global scale while the united states economy continues to recover from a brief but severe recession triggered by the covid19 pandemic its future effects are uncertain and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge for a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the covid19 pandemic the associated economic uncertainty the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction see the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december under risk factors this section includes a discussion of the significant areas of potential impact on us of the covid19 pandemic and specific actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty financial results and outlook the united states economy continues to recover from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic the easing of covid19 restrictions economic expansion and government stimulus have positively impacted credit performance and elevated payment rates we saw an increase in sales volume for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in additionally we had modest loan growth during the three months ended september we also decreased our allowance for credit losses from december refer to loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses our outlook remains unchanged from what we disclosed in the second quarter of we anticipate modest loan growth in driven by positive sales trends and new account growth we expect net interest margin to remain generally flat relative to the first quarter of through the remainder of with some variability from quarter to quarter we expect net chargeoffs to be lower yearoveryear driven by continued stable credit performance we remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable longterm growth through increased marketing and investments in core technology capabilities and efficiency improvements regulatory and legislative federal state and local governments and independent banking agencies have taken extraordinary measures to support the united states economy and mitigate the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and society at large these policies have included regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions liquidity to capital markets and financial support to businesses and consumers including fiscal stimulus payment forbearance small business lending programs increased unemployment payments and other forms of assistance lawmakers continue to offer additional proposals in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers the effects of these programs are broad and very complex and depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified thus the ultimate impact of these programs and policies on our business results of operations and financial condition is difficult to quantify and may not be known for some time for more information see regulatory environment and developments below loan receivables and allowance for credit losses at the onset of the pandemic we continued to lend to customers but tightened our standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in our loan portfolio additionally we temporarily reduced our customer acquisition and brand marketing in response to the significant economic downturn at the onset of the covid19 pandemic as a result of the strong credit performance observed in the current year and positive economic outlook we returned most of our underwriting criteria to prepandemic standards during the second quarter of additionally we increased our investments in credit card and private student loan marketing and business development in the second and third quarters of to support our loan growth initiatives in the third quarter of we decreased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of lower credit losses driven by improving macroeconomic forecasts and continued stable credit performance our allowance for credit losses includes the s risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications including troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loan modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act as of september the allowance for credit losses took into account our best estimate for the impact of programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic it is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional actions that could impact our business refer to loan quality impact of the covid19 pandemic on the loan portfolio for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses capital and liquidity we maintained liquid assets and capital levels in excess of historical norms as of september as consumer loan payment rates and deposit balances remain above their prepandemic levels we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels for example we took advantage of the lowrate tightcreditspread environment by issuing approximately billion of credit card assetbacked securities in september we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year our capital levels allow us to capitalize on loan receivable growth as customers moderate loan payment rates and continue to increase spending as the economy more fully reopens from the covid19 pandemic payment services as governments across the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of covid19 the number of crossborder transactions processed on the discover global network has declined certain negatively impacted categories such as travel may have an outsized impact on some of our diners club franchisees the impacts from the covid19 pandemic may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors such as a shift from credit to debit a decline in the use of cash increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment as economic uncertainty persists these shifts may continue to result in changes to the payment services segments results of operations fair value and impairments with the uncertain nature of the pandemics overall impact on the economy we continue to assess the effects of covid19 with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets investment securities and other longterm assets see note intangible assets to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on intangible assets business continuity and operations we have reopened some of our physical locations with appropriate health safety measures and capacity limitations including our corporate headquarters however we have informed employees that they may continue to work from home and will not be required to return to our physical locations prior to january notwithstanding the shift to workfromhome we have been able to successfully operate with no significant impact to our operations or service levels as a result upon the return to our physical locations we will offer flexible workfromhome arrangements that will provide our employees the option to work remotely on a more frequent basis than before the pandemic operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition however the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on thirdparty service providers including those with which we have no relationship such as our employees internet service providers for more information on the risks associated with reliance on thirdparty service providers and the shift to work from home see the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december under risk factors regulatory environment and developments as the united states and global economies attempt to normalize from the covid19 pandemic the banking agencies continue to evaluate whether additional actions are warranted to assist consumers financial institutions and the overall economy on march the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb announced it was rescinding several of its policy statements and withdrawing its participation in several interagency policy statements issued in response to the covid19 pandemic that had been intended to provide flexibility to financial institutions the cfpb stated that the s rescissions reflect the bureaus commitment to consumer protection and the fact that financial institutions have had a year to adapt their operations to the difficulties posed by the pandemic in addition the united states congress has taken legislative action to address the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic including the march cares act and december omnibus and covid relief and response act most recently the american rescue plan act of arpa enacted in march contained additional stimulus payments increased unemployment benefits and increased small business funding under the payment protection program the arpa also significantly increased and expanded the child tax credit for one year and provides additional funding for rental assistance programs these congressional efforts offered financial assistance and benefits to consumers and small businesses as the pandemic continues additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include provisions that significantly impact our prospects and business practices the impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on our business the economy and the united states consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified banking capital standards and stress testing dfs is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve based on forwardlooking internal analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions dfs is also subject to capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments in june the federal reserve issued a notice informing dfs that it and all other firms that participated in the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise would be required to submit revised capital plans to be assessed by the federal reserve under newly developed scenarios incorporating economic stresses reflecting the ongoing covid19 pandemic the federal reserve notified all firms subject to ccar that they would be subject to temporary restrictions on capital distributions in the third and fourth quarter of that restricted most share repurchases and limited dividends based on a formula that takes into account the firms average net income over the preceding four quarters on november dfs submitted its revised capital plan as part of the ccar resubmission process and the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its analysis on december the results indicate that dfs regulatory capital ratios remained above all minimum requirements under each of the stress test scenarios however due to ongoing economic uncertainty the federal reserve extended the temporary restrictions on capital distributions with modifications for all firms subject to the federal reserves capital planning rule through the second quarter of following an announcement by the federal reserve on june these restrictions were lifted and effective june dfs was authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the federal reserves capital rule inclusive of dfs final scb requirement of that was previously announced by the federal reserve on august and that remained in effect until the conclusion of the ccar process and the subsequent related announcement of dfs adjusted scb requirement on january the federal reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and scb requirements for firms subject to category iv standards to be consistent with the federal reserves regulatory tailoring framework the final rules generally align to instructions the federal reserve previously provided to category iv firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions the amended rules also provide category iv firms including dfs with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the federal reserve to reset the stress test portion of their scb requirement in connection with the final rulemaking the federal reserve revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework however the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain on june the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its supervisory stress tests for the firms required to participate in the ccar process in accordance with the capital plan rule amendments that were finalized in january dfs elected not to participate in the supervisory stress tests nevertheless dfs was required to submit a capital plan based on a forwardlooking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions this plan was submitted by dfs to the federal reserve on april the federal reserve thereafter used our capital plan submission to assess its capital planning process and positions and as of august announced dfs s adjusted scb requirement of to reflect dfs planned common stock dividends this adjusted scb is effective as of october london interbank offered rate on july the uk financial conduct authority fca announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the london interbank offered rate libor after to support a smooth transition away from libor the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee arrc a group of privatemarket participants tasked with facilitating a successful transition from us dollar usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc initially identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative reference rate for usd libor the arrc has also established several priorities and milestones to support the use of sofr and sofrbased indices including developing contractual fallback language for capital markets and consumer products providing clarity on legal tax accounting and regulatory matters promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the libor transition and recommending spread adjustments for sofr and sofrbased indices which will be of critical importance to market participants once usd libor settings cease in with regard to recent libor transition developments on march the fca announced the future cessation and loss of representativeness for all libor benchmark settings while nonusd and several less frequently referenced usd libor settings will cease publication immediately after december commonly referenced usd libor settings will cease publication immediately after june this future cessation event will trigger fallback provisions in many financial contracts to convert their benchmark index from libor to an alternative rate usually some form of sofr on july the arrc announced its recommendation of forwardlooking term rates based on sofr as additional alternative reference rate options we have a crossfunctional team overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of libor this team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for liborindexed instruments evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of libor publication and oversees and takes actions to transition our libor exposures to alternative benchmark rates usually sofr our existing libor exposures are limited primarily to three instrumentsvariablerate student loans interest rate swaps and capital markets securitiesand we have materially reduced our remaining exposures in all of these instruments as of september liborindexed variablerate loans comprise approximately of our private student loan portfolio and approximately of our aggregate loan portfolio these outstanding student loans indexed to libor will convert to a sofr index in when 3month usd libor will no longer be published united states banking regulators have directed banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate after december therefore beginning in november we will only originate new variablerate student loans indexed to term sofr we ceased entering into new liborindexed interest rate derivatives in and have since actively reduced libor exposures in our derivatives portfolio during the third quarter of we terminated our last liborindexed interest rate swap maturing after june our one remaining liborindexed interest rate swap will mature in january most of our capital markets securities indexed to usd libor are floatingrate assetbacked securities beginning in we included fallback provisions in all newlyissued securities that will facilitate an orderly transition from libor to sofr once and 3month libor cease to be published in approximately billion of our capital markets securities that mature after june with no fallback provisions would be covered under pending federal legislation that would allow us to replace the libor index with sofr under a safeharbor provision approximately million of our capital markets securities contain fallback provisions that would not be covered under pending federal legislation however shortly after the expected june usd libor cessation date these securities will either mature or we may exercise our right to call and redeem them we have prepared for the cessation of usd libor by taking steps to avoid new exposures and actively reduce our remaining exposures we are on track to complete before yearend any remaining transition work including providing our customers with information about the cessation of usd libor and how it will affect their contracts with us s consumer financial services the cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services including discover the cfpbs authority includes rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws preventing unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and ensuring that consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive financial products and services historically the cfpbs policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer eg credit cards and other consumer lending products in addition the cfpb is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market in december certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the cfpb regarding identified private student loan servicing practices see note litigation and regulatory matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information former federal trade commissioner rohit chopra was sworn in as the director of the cfpb on october under mr chopras leadership the cfpbs priorities are expected to focus on among other things vigorous enforcement of existing consumer protection laws with a particular focus on unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices and fair lending student lending and servicing fair lending debt collection and credit reporting these strategies and priorities and any resulting regulatory developments findings potential supervisory or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact business strategies limit or change our business practices limit consumer product offerings invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts limit fees charged for services limit our ability to implement certain enhancements to product features and functionality or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals the additional expense time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations data security and privacy policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements furthermore regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards the california consumer privacy act ccpa creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the european unions general data protection regulation the ccpa went into effect on january and the california attorney generals final regulations became effective on august with enforcement beginning july the california privacy rights act cpra a ballot measure led by the original proponent of the ccpa passed on november and largely enters into force on january the cpra replaces the ccpa to enhance consumer privacy protections further and creates a new california privacy protection agency cppa in september the cppa board initiated the cpra regulatory phase by issuing a request for preliminary comments while the cpra retains an exemption for information collected processed sold or disclosed subject to the grammleachbliley act we continue to evaluate the impact of the cpra on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services s segments we manage our business activities in two segments

the reserve release during the nine months ended september was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic forecast continued stable credit performance and a reduction in loan receivables

detailed discussion on provision for credit losses see loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses total other income increased for the three and nine months ended september as compared to

investments unrealized gains on equity investments are the result of investments in payment services entities that are carried at fair value because the shares are actively traded this increase was partially offset by a decrease in realized gains on the sale of equity investments during the prior period critical accounting estimates in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period for estimates that are particularly sensitive to economic or market conditions changes significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and in some instances could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition management has identified the estimate related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate the critical accounting estimate related to the allowance for credit losses is discussed in greater detail in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates there have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate this critical accounting estimate from those discussed in our annual

interest rate spread represents the difference between the rate on total interestearning assets and total interestbearing liabilities s loan quality impact of the covid19 pandemic on the loan portfolio the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the economy have significantly affected our sales volume and credit card loan growth we tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products and reduced our marketing and customer acquisition expenditures at the onset of the pandemic due to the strong economic recovery from the covid19 pandemicinduced recession we returned most of our underwriting criteria to prepandemic standards and resumed our investment in marketing and business development during the second quarter of this change in our credit underwriting in addition to changes in consumer spending behavior increased marketing and the reopening of the united states economy upon expiration of covid19 restrictions contributed to an increase in sales volume for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in our outstanding loan receivables as of september decreased when compared to december due to elevated payment rates resulting from the several rounds of government stimulus and associated improvement in household cash flows the decrease in outstanding loan receivables was partially offset by the robust credit card sales trends and seasonality in private student loan originations during the nine months ended september at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to include skipapay payment deferral sap and other loan modification programs complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs on august we ceased offering enrollments in the sap and other loan modification programs specifically developed in response to the covid19 pandemic the accounts using these modifications as a result of the covid19 pandemic were evaluated for potential exclusion from the tdr designation either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for an exemption pursuant to the cares act the sap programs provided only an insignificant delay in payment on the enrolled accounts or loans and therefore those deferrals were not classified as tdrs section of the cares act provides certain financial institutions with the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the covid19 pandemic section of the omnibus and covid relief and response act extended the tdr accounting and reporting relief provided by the cares act through the earlier of january or the date that is days after the termination of the presidentiallydeclared national emergency we elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs as provided under section of the cares act and as subsequently extended as such the number of accounts and corresponding balances designated as a tdr for the three and nine months ended september and have been favorably impacted by the exclusion of certain modifications from the tdr designation pursuant to these exemptions and are expected to remain lower than they otherwise would have been the payment status of

modifications including the combined total of those identified as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation decreased during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the decrease in both periods is primarily due to the impacts of several rounds of government stimulus and disaster relief programs which reduced the need for our customers to enroll in a loan modification program the number and balance of loan modifications across all products including the combined total of those identified as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation during the three and nine months ended september were favorably impacted by the utilization of sap programs in lieu of traditional loan modification programs additionally enrollments in personal loan

maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit loss we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate

september and respectively as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition prior to the adoption of accounting standards update asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses due to the adoption of asu no on january s the allowance for credit losses was approximately billion at september which reflects a million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at june and a billion release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the release in the allowance for credit losses between september and june was primarily driven by improving macroeconomic forecasts and continued stable credit performance partially offset by modest loan growth during the period the modest growth in loan receivables during the three months ended september was driven by the robust credit card sales trends as covid19 restrictions continue to ease and the united states economy continues to more fully reopen additionally credit card sales from new accounts and seasonality in private student loan originations contributed to an increase in ending outstanding loan receivables the loan receivables growth was partially offset by elevated payment rates resulting from the several rounds of government stimulus and associated improvement in household cash flows the release in the allowance for credit losses between september and december was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic forecast and continued stable credit performance the release was also partially driven by a moderate reduction in loan receivables outstanding during the period the decrease in outstanding loan receivables particularly credit card and personal loan receivables and the stable credit performance were driven by elevated payment rates resulting from the several rounds of government stimulus and associated improvement in household cash flows the decrease in outstanding loan receivables was partially offset by the robust credit card sales trends during the period and seasonality in private student loan originations in the third quarter of in estimating the allowance at september we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected i a peak unemployment rate of decreasing to and through the end of and respectively and ii a and annualized growth in the real gross domestic product for and respectively labor market conditions which historically have been an important determinant of credit loss trends continue to improve despite the spread of the covid19 delta variant however the unemployment rate and initial and continuing jobless claims remain moderately elevated relative to prepandemic levels in estimating expected credit losses we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs such as the cares act and arpa and disaster relief programs such as foreclosure moratoriums and federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance during the third quarter of several disaster relief programs expired or were rescinded entirely as the governments response to the pandemic wanes there is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the recent credit quality trends in our loan receivables portfolio accordingly the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment the forecast period we deemed reasonable and supportable was months for all periods presented except march where the forecast period was months due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment experienced at the onset of the covid19 pandemic the 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate based on the observed economic phase transition from recovery to expansion and the associated stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts for all periods presented we determined that a reversion period of months was appropriate for similar reasons due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs we applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented with the following exceptions at march and december we applied a straightline method for all loan products at june we applied a weighted reversion method for credit card loans and a straightline method for all other loan products the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three months ended september the provision for credit losses decreased by million or compared to the same period in for the nine months ended september the provision for credit losses decreased by billion or compared to the same period in the decrease in both periods was primarily due to reserve releases in the current periods versus reserve builds in the prior periods and lower net chargeoffs the reserve releases during the three and nine months ended september were primarily driven by favorable change in the macroeconomic outlook related to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemicinduced recession and continued stable credit performance the reserve builds during the three and nine months ended september were primarily due to the unfavorable change in economic outlook resulting from the covid19 pandemic s net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended september for the nine months ended september credit card loans private student loans personal loans the decreases in net chargeoffs and the net chargeoff rates for credit card and personal loans for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in were primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs and to a lesser extent improved collection and recovery strategies additionally the net chargeoffs and the net chargeoff rate of personal loans for three and nine months ended september were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early the net chargeoffs and net chargeoff rate for private student loans remained relatively flat for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs s delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs

and personal loans that were or more days delinquent at september and december the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act were immaterial we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended september and respectively and million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs we estimate this amount by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended september and respectively and million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively we do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms we estimate this amount by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day and 90day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans including tdrs modified loans exempt from tdr status and prior modifications that are no longer required to be reported as tdrs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for credit card and personal loans at september decreased compared to december primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs additionally the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early the 30day and 90day delinquency rate for private student loans at september increased compared to december as the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs began to wane the increase in the 30day and 90day delinquency rate for private student loans was partially offset by an increase in outstanding private student loan receivables resulting from seasonality in originations the balance of private student and credit card loans reported as tdrs decreased at september compared to december primarily due to the exclusion of accounts qualifying for the exemption from the tdr designation s pursuant to the cares act and elevated payment rates resulting from the several rounds of government stimulus and associated improvement in household cash flows the balance of personal loans reported as tdrs decreased at september compared to december due to elevated payment rates resulting from the several rounds of government stimulus and associated improvement in household cash flows additionally enrollments in personal loan modification programs were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early resulting in a lower balance of personal loans entering into our loan modification programs to provide additional clarity with respect to credit card loans classified as tdrs the table above presents loans that are currently enrolled in modification programs separately from loans that have exited those programs but retain that classification the following table provides the balance of loan receivables restructured through a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the

respectively as compared to the same periods in primarily due to tax credits having a lower rate benefit on higher pretax income s liquidity and capital resources impact of the covid19 pandemic on liquidity and capital the united states economy has made substantial progress recovering from a brief but severe recession caused by responses to the covid19 pandemic with measures of aggregate output and income expanding for multiple quarters and surpassing their prepandemic levels while the unemployment rate has fallen substantially from its pandemic peak the labor market has not fully recovered from the recession nonfarm payroll employment and labor force participation rates important indicators in the federal reserves monetary policy considerations remain below prepandemic levels however job openings have reached record highs suggesting that the labor market recovery will continue we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and our own internal targets consequently we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of however we maintain ample capital to finance loan receivable growth as and when customers moderate loan payment rates and continue to increase spending as the economy continues to more fully reopen from the covid19 pandemic our level of liquid assets remains in excess of historical norms as of september as consumer loan payment rates and deposit balances remain above their prepandemic levels although these factors have curtailed our need for wholesale funding we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels credit spreads have tightened materially this year nearing recordlow levels as of september we took advantage of the lowrate tightcreditspread environment by issuing approximately billion of credit card assetbacked securities in september funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations and federal home loan bank fhlb advances in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira savings accounts ira certificates of deposit and checkingdebit accounts brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts in december the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued the final rule on revisions to its regulations on brokered deposits under the fdics final rule our regulatory reporting must reflect changes to the categorization of deposits beginning january we are evaluating those changes in accordance with the final rule certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships may no longer be categorized as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes in the future at september we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in public and private transactions which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at september we had billion of s outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended september the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and charge offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritizationrelated contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add additional receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of september there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and nine months ended september alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at september total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date have been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december however other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future s federal home loan bank advances discover bank is a member bank of the fhlb of chicago one of fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the fhlb system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the united states of america us gses chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as united states treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for shortterm contingent liquidity and longterm assetliability management as a member of the fhlb of chicago discover bank has access to short and longterm advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to years at september we had approximately billion of borrowing capacity through the fhlb of chicago based on the amount and type of assets pledged as of september there were no borrowings outstanding with the fhlb of chicago under certain stressed conditions we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value other longterm borrowingsprivate student loans at september million of principal was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of the

our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as united states treasury bills or notes or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or us gses at september there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additionally the fhlb of chicago offers shortterm advance structures that we may use for shortterm liquidity needs at september there were no outstanding shortterm advances from the fhlb additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs at september we had a total committed s capacity of billion none of which was drawn we seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of september discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans as of september we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid ie idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets when the covid19 pandemic emerged in rating agencies cited their expectation that the banking industry would experience heightened loan delinquencies and charge offs from deterioration in the labor market during the second quarter of moodys standard and poors and fitch ratings affirmed our

at that point in time liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the board of directors approves the policy and the asset and liability management committee the alco is responsible for its implementation additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document that outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress the alco chaired by our treasurer with crossfunctional membership centrally manages liquidity risk the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed according to regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we could borrow fhlb advances by pledging securities to the fhlb of chicago moreover we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at september our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the federal reserve and united states treasury bills investment
