response and impact the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly its future effects are uncertain and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge for a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the covid19 pandemic the associated economic uncertainty the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction see the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december under item risk factors this section includes a discussion of significant areas of potential impact on us of the covid19 pandemic and certain actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic financial results and outlook we saw an increase in sales volume for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in additionally we decreased our allowance for credit losses from december the united states economy is recovering from a brief but severe recession triggered by the covid19 pandemic while uncertainty surrounding the pace and sustainability of economic recovery remains improved economic trends and government stimulus have positively impacted credit performance and elevated consumer payment rates we expect uncertainty in the economic recovery to continue this year with the level of impact on our business dependent on the timing and shape of the economic recovery we anticipate modest loan growth the size of which will depend on payment rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery we expect net interest margin to remain relatively flat through the remainder of we expect net chargeoffs to be relatively flat to lower yearoveryear as a result of the anticipated pace of economic recovery and recent government stimulus we remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable longterm growth through increased marketing as well as investments in core technology capabilities and efficiency improvements regulatory and legislative federal state and local governments including the united states congress the executive branch and independent banking

regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions liquidity to capital markets and financial support to businesses and consumers including financial stimulus payment forbearance small business lending programs increased unemployment payments and other forms of assistance lawmakers continue to offer additional proposals in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers the effects of these programs are broad and very complex and depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified thus the ultimate impact of these programs and policies on our business results of operations and financial condition is difficult to quantify and may not be known for some time for more information see regulatory environment and developments below loan receivables at the onset of the pandemic we continued to lend to customers but tightened our standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in our loan portfolio we continued to maintain tight underwriting standards given the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the recovery from the covid19 pandemicinduced recession at the onset of the pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to include skipapay payment deferral sap programs and other loan modification programs complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs in the first quarter of we decreased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of lower credit losses caused by the continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast our allowance for credit losses includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications including troubled debt table of contents restructurings tdrs loan modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and sap programs the allowance for credit losses as of march took into account our best estimate for the impact of programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic it is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional action that could impact our business refer to loan quality impact of the covid19 pandemic on the loan portfolio for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses capital and liquidity while uncertainty about the path and timing of economic recovery remains forecasts of economic growth have become increasingly favorable in response to the macroeconomic uncertainty as of march we maintained liquid assets and capital levels in excess of historical norms furthermore we have observed strong consumer loan payment rates and deposits demand which increased our cash and other liquid asset balances since the onset of the pandemic and curtailed our need for wholesale funding however we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels and credit spreads have returned to prepandemic levels we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year in light of the ongoing recovery in macroeconomic conditions we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of additionally we completed capital stress tests during the first quarter of in conjunction with our annual capital plan and maintain ample capital to ensure we remain wellcapitalized while continuing to serve our customers and extend assistance to those who need it for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of the adoption of the current expected credit loss cecl accounting model on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule announced by federal banking regulators on march pursuant to the interim final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over a threeyear period beginning in payment services as governments across the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of covid19 the number of crossborder transactions processed on the discover global network has declined certain negatively impacted categories such as travel may have an outsized impact on some of our diners club franchisees the impacts from the covid19 pandemic may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors such as a shift from credit to debit a decline in the use of cash increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment as economic uncertainty persists these shifts may continue to result in changes to the payment services segments results of operations fair value and impairments with the uncertain nature of the pandemics overall

the shift to workfromhome our operations continue largely unaffected due to the successful implementation of certain of our business continuity plans operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition however the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on thirdparty service providers including those with which we have no relationship such as our employees internet service providers for more information on the risks associated with reliance on thirdparty service providers

stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve based on internal forwardlooking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions discover is also subject to capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold that is established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments on june we received results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and preliminary scb requirement the notice indicated that discovers capital ratios remain above all required minimums under each of the supervisory scenarios and based on the stress test results our preliminary scb

been provided by the federal reserve to category iv firms for recent capital plan submissions the amended rules also provides category iv firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish to have the stress test portion of their scb reset the federal reserve had solicited comment on the need for possible changes to regulatory guidance related to the

participants tasked with ensuring a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the alternative reference rate for usd libor additionally the arrc has established several priorities and milestones to support the use of sofr including developing contractual fallback language for capital markets and consumer products providing clarity on legal tax accounting and regulatory matters and promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the libor transition we have offered and continue to offer floatingrate private student loans based on libor these loans comprise approximately of our private student loan portfolio or approximately of our overall loan portfolio our floatingrate borrowings are indexed to libor and limited to assetbacked securities issued by our securitization trusts united states banking regulators have reinforced the need to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate after december we have a crossfunctional team overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of libor this team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for liborindexed instruments evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of libor publication and facilitates the operational changes associated with the transition to an

limit or change our business practices limit our product offerings invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts limit the fees we can charge for services or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and obtain related required regulatory approvals the additional expense time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may

during the first quarter of critical accounting estimates in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions significant changes to the estimated amount from periodtoperiod are also possible management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain cases could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate discussion of critical accounting estimates related to the allowance for credit losses are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december that discussion can be found within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates there have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our annual report on form

a significant effect on our sales volume and credit card loan growth we tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products at the onset of the pandemic while sales volume has increased for the threemonth period ended march as compared to the same period in we continued to maintain tightened underwriting standards given the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the recovery from the covid19 pandemicinduced recession the tightened underwriting standards and higher payment rate by consumers along with the seasonality of our credit card loan portfolio contributed to the decrease in our outstanding loans receivable as of march compared to december at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to include sap and other loan modification programs complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs on august we ceased offering enrollments in the sap and other loan modification programs developed specifically in response to the covid19 pandemic the accounts using these modifications as a result of the covid19 pandemic were evaluated for potential exclusion from the tdr designation either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for exemption pursuant to the cares act the sap programs provided only an insignificant delay in payment on the enrolled accounts or loans and therefore those deferrals were not classified as tdrs the utilization of these sap programs had a favorable impact on reported credit performance in because accounts enrolled in the sap programs did not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as they would have without the programs as the sap programs ended in august certain loans that subsequently exited the sap programs began advancing through the delinquency cycle or to chargeoff as appropriate the impact to loan delinquencies was most pronounced in the second quarter of when the sap programs were initially offered the impact dissipated as enrollments tapered off significantly after the initial months of the covid19 pandemic in the first quarter of net chargeoffs were unfavorably impacted by accounts that had been enrolled in a sap program and were unable to cure their default section of the cares act provides certain financial institutions with the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the covid19 pandemic section of the omnibus and covid relief and response act extended the tdr accounting and reporting relief provided by the cares act through the earlier of january or the date that is days after the termination of the presidentiallydeclared national emergency we elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs as provided under section of the cares act and as subsequently extended as such tdr program balances and number of accounts for the three months ended march have been favorably impacted by the exclusion of certain modifications from the tdr designation pursuant to these exemptions and are expected to remain lower than they otherwise would have been the payment status of modified accounts excluded from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act is reflected in our delinquency reporting table of contents the table below reflects the number and balance of both new loan modifications reported as tdrs and new loan modifications

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation the number and balance of new credit card and personal loan modifications including the combined total of those designated as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr status decreased during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in the decrease is due to the impacts of government stimulus and governmentoffered disaster relief programs which is consistent with the delinquency and net chargeoff trends discussed within delinquencies and net chargeoffs respectively the number and balance of new private student loan modifications including the combined total of those designated as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act increased during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in the increase was due to the utilization of sap programs in in lieu of traditional loan modification programs sap programs do not constitute tdrs given the insignificant delay in payment they are therefore also excluded from tdrs evaluated for exemption pursuant to the cares act this increase was partially offset by the impacts of government stimulus and governmentoffered disaster relief programs in the current period the following table provides the number of accounts that exited a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act and corresponding outstanding balances along with the amount of the outstanding balances that were delinquent or more days past due upon

includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications including tdrs loan modifications exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act and sap programs we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses refer to note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs tdrs and the allowance for credit losses loan receivables consist of the following dollars in millions march december credit card loans other loans private student loans personal loans other loans total other loans total loan receivables allowance for credit losses net loan receivables provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit loss we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements the level and direction of historical losses and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was billion at march which reflects an million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the release in the overall allowance was primarily driven by a reduction in loan receivables outstanding continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast the decrease in our outstanding loans receivable particularly our credit card loans and the stable credit performance was driven in part by elevated payment rates resulting from the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows in estimating expected credit losses we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs such as the cares act and arpa and governmentoffered disaster relief programs such as foreclosure moratoriums and federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance in estimating the allowance at march we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected i a peak unemployment rate of which decreases to through the end of and ii a growth in real gross domestic product in labor market conditions which historically have been an important determinant of our credit loss trends have improved but remain stressed by the pandemic unemployment claims have fallen below pandemic peaks but unemployment remains elevated by historical standards moreover the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and the governments response to the pandemic has continued to cause uncertainty in our assumptions surrounding factors table of contents such as the pace and sustainability of economic recovery accordingly the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months as of march and december the 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate on the basis of observed stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts as of march the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment experienced at the onset of the covid19 pandemic as of march december and march we determined that a reversion period of months was appropriate during the first quarter of a straightline method was used to revert to appropriate historical information due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs we applied a weighted reversion method to provide for a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products as of march and december the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three months ended march the provision for credit losses decreased by billion or as compared to the same periods in the largest driver of the decrease in provision between the two periods was the favorable change in the macroeconomic outlook related to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemicinduced recession net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended march credit card loans private student loans personal loans the decrease in net chargeoffs and net chargeoff rates across all loan products for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in was primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and governmentoffered disaster relief programs partially offset by accounts that had been in an sap program and did not cure the decrease in net chargeoffs on credit card loans was also favorably impacted by a decrease in outstanding loan receivables periodoverperiod the decrease in net chargeoffs on personal loans also reflects tightened underwriting standards implemented around the onset of the covid19 pandemic table of contents delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs dollars in millions march december loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans not accruing interest troubled debt restructurings credit card loans currently enrolled no longer enrolled total credit card loans private student loans personal loans credit card loans that were or more days delinquent at march and december included million and million respectively in modified loans exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act within private student and personal loans that were or more days delinquent at march and december the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act were immaterial we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs this amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms this amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day and 90day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans including tdrs modified loans exempt from tdr status and prior modifications which are no longer required to be reported as tdrs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates across credit card loans and personal loans as well as the 30day delinquency rates for private student loans at march decreased compared to december primarily due to government stimulus and governmentoffered disaster relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans were also favorably impacted by tightened underwriting standards implemented around the onset of the covid19 pandemic the 90day delinquency rate for private student loans as march was essentially flat table of contents the balance of loans reported as tdrs across all loan products decreased at march as compared to december primarily due to elevated payment rates resulting from the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows additionally the balance of loans reported as tdrs continues to be favorably impacted by the accounts qualifying for the exemption from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act as well as the exclusion of prior tdrs that were subsequently restructured to a market interest rate and the customer has demonstrated financial stability to provide additional clarity with respect to credit card loans classified as tdrs the table above presents loans that are currently enrolled in modification programs separately from loans that have exited those programs but retain that classification the following table provides the balance of loan receivables restructured through a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act dollars in millions march december credit card loans private student loans personal loans we believe loan modification programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and help to prevent defaults we plan to continue to use loan modification programs as a means to provide

transaction processing revenue gains on equity investments other income total other income net of rewards including cashback bonus rewards of million and million for the three months ended march and respectively total other income decreased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to a decrease in gains on equity investments and loan fee income partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue gains on equity investments decreased primarily from a sale during the first quarter of loan fee income decreased primarily due to lower late fees and cash advance fees the increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs both of which were primarily the result of higher sales volume table of

marketing and business development information processing and communications professional fees premises and equipment other expense total other expense total other expense decreased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to a decrease in marketing and business development and other expense partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits marketing costs decreased primarily due to expense reductions in acquisition and brand advertising for our credit card product the decrease in other expense was primarily driven by lower fraud losses employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher bonus accruals and higher average salaries income tax expense the following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate dollars in millions for the three months ended march income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income tax expense and the effective tax rate increased million and percentage points respectively for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in the increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by an increase in pretax income the effective tax rate increased primarily due to tax credits having a lower rate benefit on higher pretax income liquidity and capital resources impact of the covid19 pandemic on liquidity and capital the united states economy is recovering from a brief but severe recession caused by the covid19 pandemic while uncertainty about the path and timing of economic recovery remains vaccines have become more widely available in the united states and forecasts of economic growth have become increasingly favorable in response to the macroeconomic uncertainty we maintained liquid assets and capital levels in excess of historical norms as of march furthermore we have observed strong consumer loan payment rates and deposits demand which increased our cash and other liquid asset balances since the onset of the pandemic and curtailed our need for wholesale funding however we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels and credit spreads have returned to prepandemic levels we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year in light of the ongoing recovery in macroeconomic conditions we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of additionally we completed capital stress tests during the first quarter of in conjunction with our annual capital plan and maintain ample capital to ensure we remain wellcapitalized while continuing to serve our customers and extend assistance to those who need it table of contents funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents investment securities as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations and federal home loan bank advances in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at march we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at march we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended march the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered table of contents an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add additional receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of march there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended march alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at march total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date have been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future federal home loan bank advances discover bank is a member bank of the federal home loan bank of chicago one of federal home loan banks fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the federal home loan bank system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the united states of america us gses chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as united states treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs benefit from consistent capital markets access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for shortterm contingent liquidity and longterm assetliability management as a member of the fhlb of chicago we have access to both short and longterm advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to years at march we had billion of borrowing capacity through the fhlb of chicago based on the amount and type of assets pledged as of march we have no borrowings outstanding with the fhlb of chicago under certain stressed conditions we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value other longterm borrowingsprivate student loans at march million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized

repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as united states treasury bills or notes or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or us gses at march there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additionally the fhlb of chicago offers shortterm advance structures that we may use for shortterm liquidity needs at march there were no outstanding shortterm advances from the fhlb additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at march we had total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and for seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of march discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity table of contents credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets when the covid19 pandemic emerged in rating agencies cited their expectation that the banking industry would experience heightened loan delinquencies and chargeoffs from deterioration in the labor market during the second quarter of moodys standard and poors and

level at that point in time liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet table of contents current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we could borrow fhlb advances by pledging securities to the federal home loan bank of chicago moreover we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at march our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve and united states treasury bills investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the united states treasury and residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs issued by united states government agencies or us gses these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management policies for instance our liquidity portfolio grew during as our customer deposits increased and our loan balances declined reflecting consumers response to the covid19 pandemic our liquidity portfolio continued to grow in the first quarter of due to net principal repayments on loan receivables resulting from elevated customer payment rates which was driven by the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows table of contents at march our liquidity portfolio

proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities as well as dividends from our subsidiaries particularly discover bank under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets in addition our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from discover bank to the bank holding company we utilize a measure referred to as number of months of prefunding to determine the length of time discover financial services can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources in managing this metric we structure our debt maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time see note longterm borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum levels of capital failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as the adoption of the cecl accounting model may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position table of contents dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic to implement the provisions under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios under basel iii rules for regulatory capital dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities defined as united states banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion thresholds within the basel iii rules were fully phased in as of january with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulations issued in november pursuant to a final rule issued in july the transition provisions that were previously frozen will be replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below additionally on march federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim and now final rule that allows banks that have implemented the cecl accounting model to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule after that period of deferral the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over a threeyear period
