results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december which is filed with the securities and exchange commission sec and available at the secs internet site httpswwwsecgov introduction and overview discover financial services dfs is a digital banking and payment services company we provide digital banking products and services and payment services through our

services pulse operates an electronic funds transfer network providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the pulse network with access to automated teller machines domestically and internationally and merchant acceptance throughout the united states of america us for debit card transactions diners club is a global payments network of licensees which are generally financial institutions that issue diners club branded credit and charge cards andor provide card acceptance services our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers financial institutions merchants and issuers the primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs interest expense credit loss provisions customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow manage and service our loan receivables and networks our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt quarter highlights the highlights below compare results as of and for the three months ended march against results for the same period in the prior year net income was million or per diluted share compared to net income of billion or per diluted share in the prior year total loans grew billion or to billion credit card loans grew billion or to billion the net chargeoff rate for credit card loans increased basis points to and the delinquency rate for credit card loans over days past due increased basis points to directtoconsumer deposits grew billion or to billion payment services transaction volume for the segment was billion up outlook the outlook below provides our current expectations for our financial results based on market conditions the regulatory and legal environment and our business strategies the outlook below does not incorporate the impacts of a potential sale of our student loan portfolio we expect a slight increase in total loans based on the current interest rate environment net interest margin is expected to decline modestly in comparison to we expect the total net chargeoff rate to increase in comparison to the prior year driven primarily by the seasoning of recent vintages with higher delinquencies excluding card misclassification and merger related costs total expenses are expected to increase driven by continued investments in compliance and risk management capabilities and wage growth we remain committed to managing expenses while continuing to make investments in profitable longterm growth regulatory environment and developments banking capital standards and stress testing as a bank holding company dfs is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve based on forwardlooking internal analysis of income and capital levels under baseline and stressful conditions dfs is also subject to capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which requires maintaining regulatory capital levels above a threshold based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments in january the federal reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and scb requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including dfs to be consistent with the federal reserves regulatory tailoring framework the final rules generally align to instructions the federal reserve previously provided to category iv firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions the amended rules also provide category iv firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the federal reserve to reset the stress test portion of their scb requirement the federal reserve also revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework however the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain moreover following the failure of three domestic banks during march and april members of congress the president of the united states and various bank regulatory authorities have made public statements indicating a desire for additional prudential regulation for category iv firms like dfs in july the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued a proposal to amend the riskbased capital framework the basel iii rules which includes replacing the current advanced approach with a new expanded riskbased approach in addition the proposal introduces new standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk and would significantly revise riskbased capital requirements for all banking institutions with assets of billion or more including dfs if adopted the new requirements would be effective july with a threeyear transition period in august the federal reserve the fdic and the occ the agencies issued a proposal that would require banking institutions in categories ii through iv of the tailoring framework including dfs and their insured depository institution subsidiaries with billion or more in assets such as discover bank to have minimum levels of outstanding longterm debt under the proposed rule a covered banking institution would be required to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible longterm debt that is at least of the institutions total riskweighted assets of its total leverage exposure if it is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio and of its average total consolidated assets whichever is greater if adopted banking institutions would have three years to comply with the new requirements though the agencies would retain the authority to accelerate or extend the transition period while we cannot currently predict the timing or substance of the finalization of these proposals or other regulatory changes if any such change were adopted it would likely revise the regulatory tailoring currently applicable to dfs otherwise tighten the prudential regulatory requirements that would apply to dfs and increase our expenses in june the federal reserve released results of the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise our capital levels demonstrated resiliency under stress staying well above regulatory minimums based on these results in august our new scb was set at the lowest possible requirement this new scb was effective october through september in accordance with the capital plan rule amendments we elected not to participate in the supervisory stress tests nevertheless on april we submitted to the federal reserve a capital plan based on a forwardlooking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions on july the federal reserve disclosed that our scb was unchanged at effective beginning october through september on april we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve the federal reserve is expected to announce the results of the supervisory stress test by june and our scb by august the new scb would be effective from october through september under the basel iii rules a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan under certain circumstances including a material change in the firms risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission on february discover and capital one financial corporation capital one jointly announced that they entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement under which the companies will combine in an allstock merger which we determined required us to resubmit our capital plan we will submit our updated capital plan by may under the capital plan rule and as a consequence of the resubmission requirement we must receive prior approval for any dividend or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument the capital plan rule provides that unless the federal reserve determines to extend the timeline the federal reserve must provide us notice of whether our scb will be recalculated within days of the submission of our updated capital plan and if applicable must provide our updated scb within days of notifying us that the scb will be recalculated consumer financial services the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services including discover the cfpbs authority includes rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws preventing unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap and ensuring that consumers have access to fair and transparent financial products and services historically the cfpbs policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer eg credit cards and other consumer lending products in addition the cfpb is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market the cfpbs priorities have continued to focus on among other things increased enforcement of existing consumer protection laws with a particular focus on fees charged to consumers udaap fair lending student lending and servicing debt collection and credit reporting additionally detection of repeat offenders such as companies that violate a formal court or agency order has also become a priority for the cfpb director chopra in march identified as repeat offenders several companies that have had multiple enforcement actions including discover the cfpb has recently taken action against financial institutions for violating prior enforcement actions in december certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the cfpb regarding identified private student loan servicing practices see note litigation and regulatory matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on march the cfpb issued a final rule that reduces regulation zs safe harbor amount for late fees to and eliminates automatic annual inflation adjustments to that safe harbor amount while the final rule is effective may and could result in increased cardholder delinquencies and credit losses we continue to monitor legal developments that could impact the timing and outcome of the final rule enhanced regulatory requirements potential supervisory findings or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our ability to implement certain consumerfocused enhancements to product features and functionality and business strategies limit or change our business practices limit our consumer product offerings cause us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals the additional expense time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations data security and privacy policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements furthermore regulations and legislation at various levels of government continue to be proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards and require companies to assess andor disclose cybersecurity metrics risks opportunities policies and practices at the federal level discover is subject to the grammleachbliley act glba and its implementing regulations and guidance which regulate discovers use and disclosure of our consumers nonpublic personal information npi in july the sec adopted rules on cybersecurity risk management strategy governance and incident disclosure for more information on discovers cybersecurity program in connection with these rules see item cybersecurity in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december in april the department of homeland security proposed regulations to implement the cyber incident reporting for critical infrastructure act of and will promulgate new cyber incident and ransom payment reporting requirements for covered entities such as financial services companies at the state level the california consumer privacy act ccpa which became effective in created a broad set of privacy rights and remedies the california privacy rights act which became effective on january amends the ccpa enhancing consumer privacy protections and creating a new california privacy protection agency cppa the cppa has proposed additional regulations around cybersecurity risk assessments and automated decisionmaking technology that may impact discover as the proposed regulations move forward in the formal rulemaking process other states continue to pass privacy legislation so far these laws exempt either npi or financial institutions subject to the glba or state banking laws from their scope so the impact of these state privacy laws on several discover businesses is limited we continue to evaluate the impact of the ccpa as well as other federal and state laws on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services including laws regulating the capture and use of consumer biometrics for more information on the impact to discover of data security and privacy laws on regulation see business supervision and regulation and item risk factors to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december environmental social and governance matters environmental social and governance esg issues including climate change human capital and governance practices are a significant area of focus by us federal state and international lawmakers and regulatory agencies as well as shareholders and other stakeholders in recent months there have been substantial legislative and regulatory developments on such issues including proposed issued or implemented legislation and rulemakings concerning how companies assess andor disclose climate and other esg information risks opportunities policies and practices for example in march the sec issued a final rule on climaterelated disclosures and in october three climaterelated disclosure bills were signed in california the potential impacts to us of these legislative and regulatory requirements are still being evaluated at this time including as a result of ongoing litigation challenging such requirements although we expect that these and other emerging and evolving legal and regulatory requirements on esg issues will result in additional compliance and reporting costs to us we continue to evaluate and assess the potential impact of these legal and regulatory developments segments we manage our business activities in two segments digital banking and payment services based on the products and services provided for a detailed description of the operations of each segment as well as the allocation conventions used in our business segment reporting

returns digital banking our digital banking segment reported pretax income of million for the three months ended march as compared to billion for the same period in net interest income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily driven by a higher average level of loan receivables and a higher yield on loans partially offset by higher funding costs interest income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average level of loan receivables and higher market rates interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a larger funding base and higher funding costs driven by lower coupon maturities and higher market rates for the three months ended march the provision for credit losses increased as compared to the same period in primarily driven by an increase in delinquencies for a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses see loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses total other income for the digital banking segment increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to increases in net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income the increase in net discount and interchange revenue was driven primarily from favorable sales volume mix loan fee income increased primarily due to a higher volume of late payments total other expense increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to increases in other expense professional fees and employee compensation and benefits other expense increased primarily from an increase in the reserve for remediation related to the card product misclassification for information regarding the card product misclassification see note litigation and regulatory matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements professional fees increased primarily due to increased consulting supporting compliance and risk management initiatives the increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily by higher average salaries discover card sales volume was billion for the three months ended march which was a decrease of as compared to the same period in this volume decrease was primarily driven by lower new account growth payment services pretax income for the payment services segment increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in transaction processing revenue from higher debit transaction volume critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain cases could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses was billion at march which reflects a million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost changes in the allowance for credit losses and in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in estimating the expected credit losses we use a combination of statistical models and qualitative analysis there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to estimate the allowance for credit losses for more information on these judgments and our accounting policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loan quality note loan receivables and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december one of the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in estimating the current expected credit losses cecl on a quarterly basis is the determination of the macroeconomic forecasts used in the loss forecast models for the reasonable and supportable loss forecast period we consider forecasts of multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with one or more optimistic upside or pessimistic downside scenarios these scenarios comprise a variety of macroeconomic variables including annualized gross domestic product growth and unemployment rate the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are inherently uncertain and as a result actual changes in the allowance for credit losses may be different from the simulated scenario presented below to demonstrate the sensitivity of the estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we measured the impact of altering the weighting of macroeconomic scenarios used in our loss forecast our allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately million at march if we applied weight to the most adverse scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect continued inflationary pressures including a decline in consumer confidence and the influence of geopolitical events as well as high interest rates the sensitivity disclosed above is hypothetical it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input such as the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses the macroeconomic scenarios used are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses the inputs in the macroeconomic scenarios may not change at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others as a result the sensitivity analysis above does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses it is intended to provide insights into the impact of different judgments about the economy on our modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and does not imply any expectation of future losses furthermore the hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current allowance for credit losses which may have a positive or negative effect on our actual financial condition and results of operations the overall economic environment directly impacts the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience significant instability in the economic environment the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them earnings summary the following table outlines changes in our condensed consolidated statements of income dollars in millions for the three

margin net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interestearning assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and

provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously chargedoff or are expected to be chargedoff establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of new account and loan originations and loan maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including

financial condition represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was approximately billion at march which reflects a million release from december the release in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended march was driven by lower receivables and a modestly more favorable economic outlook offset in part by higher expected delinquencies and losses the allowance estimation process begins with a loss forecast that uses certain macroeconomic variables and multiple macroeconomic scenarios among its inputs in estimating the allowance at march we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected the following weighted average amounts i unemployment rate ending at and within our reasonable and supportable period peaking at in the third quarter of and ii growth rate in real gross domestic product in in estimating expected credit losses we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior and payment trends as well as recent and expected macroeconomic conditions including those relating to consumer price inflation and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation the federal reserve raised its federal funds rate target range substantially during and the first three quarters of in an effort to slow economic growth and reduce inflation real gdp growth and labor market conditions have exceeded most economists expectations despite an inflation level that has moderated but remains above the target rate federal reserve officials have suggested that the policy rate is likely at its peak for the current tightening cycle however the timing and magnitude of rate decreases will be dependent on trends in economic data particularly inflation restrictive monetary policy typically precedes weaker consumer credit conditions caused by rising unemployment as economic growth slows while credit performance in our lending portfolios has evolved in line with our expectations we assessed the prospects for various macroeconomic outcomes in setting our allowance for credit losses the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months for all periods presented the months reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate given the current economic conditions for all periods presented we determined that a reversion period of months was appropriate for the same reason we applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three months ended march the provision for credit losses increased by million compared to the same period in primarily driven by an increase in delinquencies net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended march credit card

from a large and diverse customer base and therefore the majority of these deposit account balances are insured according to the fdics insurance limits brokered deposit products include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts in accordance with fdic guidance we do not categorize certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes at march we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits of which there are billion of deposit balances due in less than one year and billion of deposit balances due in one year or thereafter credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in public and private transactions which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest as of march there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended march we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holding the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at march we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended march the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritizationrelated contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at march total less than one year one year and thereafter scheduled maturities of borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date have been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december however other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future federal home loan bank advances discover bank is a member bank of the fhlb of chicago one of fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the fhlb system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the us us gses chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as us treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for shortterm contingency liquidity and longterm assetliability management as a member of the fhlb of chicago discover bank has access to short and longterm advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to years at march we had total committed borrowing capacity of billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged of which billion of longterm advances were outstanding with the fhlb of chicago under certain stressed conditions we could pledge our liquidity portfolio

thereafter see note longterm borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highly rated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or us gses at march there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additionally we have access to shortterm advance structures through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at march there were no shortterm advances outstanding from private assetbacked securitizations additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for any contingency funding needs at march we had a total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn we seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them well ahead of their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of march discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans as of march we had no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingency liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit to customers primarily through discover bank the maintenance of sufficient working capital for routine operations the service of our debt and capital obligations including interest principal and dividend payments and the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio in addition to originating consumer loans to new customers we also extend credit to existing customers which primarily arises from agreements for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement at march our unused credit arrangements were approximately billion these arrangements substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements are periodically reviewed based on account usage customer creditworthiness loan qualification and the cost of capital in the normal course of business we enter into various contracts for goods and services such as consulting outsourcing data sponsorships software licenses telecommunications and global merchant acceptance among other things these contracts are legally binding and specify all significant terms including any applicable fixed future cash payments as of march we have debt obligations common stock and preferred stock outstanding for which we incur servicing costs refer to funding sources and capital for more information related to our debt obligations and capital service respectively and the timing of expected payments we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingency uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid ie idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity if we determine we have excess cash and cash equivalents above what is required for daily operations we may invest in highly liquid unencumbered assets that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using the repo market or other secured borrowing or outright sales guarantees guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that may require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset liability or equity security of a guaranteed party rate or index also included in guarantees are contracts that may require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the discover network and certain transactions processed by pulse and diners club in the ordinary course of business we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties the activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements see note commitments contingencies and guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in our credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets the table below reflects our current credit ratings

and assessments for dfs and discover bank under review with direction uncertain an sf in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating a credit rating outlook reflects an agencys opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term often a period of about a year and indicates the agencys belief that the issuers credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or other secured borrowing or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the board of directors approves the policy and the asset and liability management committee the alco is responsible for its implementation we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress the alco chaired by our treasurer has crossfunctional membership and manages liquidity risk centrally the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed to follow regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of periods by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingency liquidity our primary contingency liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we could borrow fhlb advances by pledging securities to the fhlb of chicago moreover we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingency liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at march our liquidity portfolio was composed of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the federal reserve investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and us gses and residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government agencies or us gses these investments nearly all of which are classified as availableforsale are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based on the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management objectives at march our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which was billion higher than the balance at december our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities grew primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended march and december the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was billion and billion respectively our liquidity portfolio and undrawn facilities consist of the following dollars in millions march december liquidity portfolio cash and cash equivalents investment securities total liquidity portfolio private assetbacked securitizations federal home loan

respectively see additional funding sources for additional information bank holding company liquidity the primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated dfs level include debt service obligations interest payments and return of principal and capital service and management activities including dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities as well as dividends from our subsidiaries notably discover bank under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets in addition our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from discover bank to the bank holding company we utilize a measure referred to as number of months of prefunding to determine the length of time dfs can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources in managing this metric we structure our debt maturity schedule to manage prudently the amount of debt maturing within a short period see note longterm borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support our businesses growth account for their risks and meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum capital levels failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as those related to the adoption of the cecl accounting model or those related to the proposed revisions to the basel committees december framework basel iii rules may require us to hold more capital andor adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic respectively under the basel iii rules under these rules dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities as they are us banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios in accordance with the final rule on the impact of cecl on regulatory capital we have elected to phase in the impact over three years beginning in by electing this option our common equity tier cet1 capital ratios are higher than they otherwise would have been the phasein of the cecl accounting model decreased cet1 by billion as of january for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements federal reserve rules impose limitations on dfs capital distributions if we do not maintain our riskbased capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests we are required to assess whether dfs planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distribution limitations that will apply on a proforma basis throughout the planning horizon the scb requirement is institutionspecific and is calculated as the greater of i and ii the sum of a the difference between dfs actual cet1 ratio at the beginning of the forecast and the projected minimum cet1 ratio based on the federal reserves models in its ninequarter severely adverse stress scenario plus b the sum of the dollar amount of dfs planned common stock dividend distributions for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of its ninequarter capital planning horizon expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets for category iv firms including dfs the federal reserve calculates each firms scb biennially in evennumbered calendar years and did so in based on the results of the ccar exercise released by the federal reserve our new scb was set at the lowest possible requirement effective october through september in oddnumbered years each firm subject to category iv standards that did not optin to such years supervisory stress tests as part of the federal reserves ccar process receives an adjusted scb requirement that is updated to reflect its planned common stock dividends per the firms annual capital plan in july the federal reserve disclosed scb requirements to firms subject to category iv standards that did not optin to this years stress test our scb remains unchanged at effective beginning october through september on april we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve and expect results of the supervisory stress test by june and our final scb by august under the basel iii rules a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan under certain circumstances including a material change in the firms risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission on february discover and capital one jointly announced that they entered into a merger agreement under which the companies will combine in an allstock merger which we determined required us to resubmit our capital plan we will submit our updated capital plan by may the capital plan rule provides that unless the federal reserve determines to extend the timeline the federal reserve must provide us notice of whether our scb will be recalculated within days of the submission of our updated capital plan and if applicable must provide our updated scb within days of notifying us that the scb will be recalculated see regulatory environment and
