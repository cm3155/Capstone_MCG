transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 among other roles i served as senior deputy comptroller of the currency earlier in my career most relevant to my current position i was chairman and ceo of bancwest

customers and employees as an effective leader during this important period john greene will discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail but let me highlight a few aspects of our financial performance discovers operating performance remained solid with increased revenues in the period driven by good loan growth largely reflecting payment rate normalization and a resilient net interest margin we are seeing receivables expansion while remaining prudent in our underwriting and disciplined in customer acquisition credit continues to perform in line with our expectations and delinquency formation has stabilized as we had anticipated importantly we continue to strengthen our risk management and compliance programs where we are investing in meaningful resources in the first quarter following continuing internal reviews and after extensive discussions with several constituencies including merchants and regulators discover decided to significantly increase our liability for the card misclassification issue we believe that taking this action will advance the resolution of these issues theres been a lot of change at discover over the last few months and i thought it might be helpful to emphasize our framework for decisionmaking our goals are to maximize shareholder value by executing on our risk management and compliance priorities sustaining our commitment to outstanding customer service and seeing that the company remains well positioned to drive longterm value creation as the interim ceo of discover im committed to these objectives which will improve our company and allow us to make the strongest contribution to the combined capital one the capital one team is leading the integration planning process and we look forward to partnering with our colleagues in support of our shared objectives the process has achieved the first important milestone the submission of the merger applications to the federal reserve and the occ we continue to believe that the strategic rationale operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling the merger will advance the companys shared mission to help our customers meet their financial goals support our commitments to our communities and make the combined company a wellpositioned bank and a competitive payments network of the future finally id like to thank michael rhodes for his leadership through an important phase his new position allows him to fulfill his career goal of leading a public company and my colleagues and i wish him well with that ill now ask john greene to review our first quarter financial results john t greene executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services thank you michael and good morning everyone ill start with our summary financial results on slide in the quarter we reported net income of million which was down from the prioryear quarter impacting our operating results was a million increase to our reserve for remediation related to the card misclassification issue discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 the decision to increase the reserve was based upon among other factors the companys experience to date with remediation efforts regulatory dialogue and our pending merger with capital one as michael indicated we believe this action is aligned with our compliance and risk management objectives and will significantly help advance the resolution of this issue our core financial performance remains strong key highlights for the quarter include doubledigit revenue expansion from loan growth a resilient net interest margin strong consumer deposit growth and credit performance consistent with our view that losses will peak and plateau in mid to late excluding the card misclassification remediation reserve increase we would have reported net income of approximately million eps of about per share and an efficiency ratio under these figures indicate a strong start to let us review the details beginning on slide our net interest margin ended the quarter at down basis points from the prior year and up basis points sequentially on a quarteroverquarter basis expanding loan yields from a lower card promotional balance mix and payment rate moderation were partially offset by higher net funding costs receivable growth is slowing from its peak in the first quarter of but continues to be strong card receivables increased yearoveryear due to a lower payment rate and contribution from prioryear new account growth the payment rate declined about basis points from the sequential quarter and is now about basis points above levels discover card sales were down compared to the prioryear quarter sales slowed across categories with the largest decline occurring in the everyday category which includes supermarkets gas and wholesale clubs while we continue to add new accounts in general we are seeing card members spend less particularly among lower income households which are most impacted by the cumulative effects of inflation based on trends in the period we expect sales to be flat to slightly negative this year personal loans were up driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rates versus the prior year we are seeing strong uptake on our offering as higher interest rates in cards can make debt consolidation more appealing for some consumers approximately of our first quarter originations in personal loans were utilized for debt consolidation with disbursements primarily made directly to creditors student loans were flat yearoveryear as previously announced we stopped accepting applications for new student loans on february we formally launched the sales process in midmarch and several thousand potential buyers have provided an initial indication of interest we continue to anticipate strong demand and still target a closing date late in the third or fourth quarter average deposits were up yearoveryear and sequentially our directtoconsumer balances grew billion in the period we have started to decrease pricing on our deposit products ahead of any potential moves in reference rates this is consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in the down part of the cycle and this action contributed to our strong nim performance in the quarter looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was primarily driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue an increase in loan fee income and higher transaction processing revenue from our pulse business pulse continued to grow at a healthy clip as debit volume increased by billion or yearoveryear discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 our rewards rate was basis points in the period a decrease of basis points versus the prioryear quarter the decline reflects lower cashback match from slowing new account growth and the active management of our categories prior to reviewing expenses i would like to briefly comment on the cfpb late fee proposal we continue to closely monitor the legal process around the proposal if the rule were to be implemented on an annualized basis we estimate a pretax reduction of around million or approximately of revenues moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear as mentioned the predominant driver of this growth was the increase to our remediation reserve absent this our expenses would have increased yearoveryear looking at our major expense categories compensation costs increased million or due to an increase in business technology resources and severance related to organizational changes including the winddown of our student loan business professional fees were up million or driven by continued investments in compliance and risk management initiatives higher recovery fees and mergerrelated expenses information processing increased due to technology investments our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the year excluding remediationrelated costs remains in the million range with an upside bias moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter in card as we anticipated delinquency formation is improving as more recent vintages season the 30plusday delinquency rate was down basis points versus the prior quarter from a vintage perspective our card vintage is performing relatively in line with our vintage both vintages remain profitable and above our return thresholds this performance has been contemplated in our full year net chargeoff guidance we executed some incremental tightening during the first quarter which will influence our new account growth for the year personal loan net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter we expect losses in this product to trend higher in the near term before plateauing beginning late this year or into turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our credit reserve balances declined million from the prior quarter and our reserve rate increased by basis points to the reserve rate increase was primarily driven by the reduction of seasonal transactor balances in the quarter given our expectation for total company losses to peak and plateau in mid to late we believe the credit reserve rate is likely at or near peak levels assuming a stable macroeconomic environment and no significant unexpected changes in portfolio performance looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was down basis points sequentially impacts from the increase in expenses and the cecl phasein were offset by lower receivables and core earnings generation we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock concluding on slide we have made the following updates to our outlook we are increasing our loan growth expectations to up lowsingle digits this primarily reflects our expectation of further decline in the discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 payment rates offsetting our view of flat to slightly negative sales growth this year and a modest contribution from new accounts we are increasing our net interest margin range to to this change was driven by two factors first the forward curve now reflects an expectation of two rate cuts this year versus our prior forecast of four cuts and second we have been proactive in lowering our deposit rates our cumulative deposit beta is now about and we think there will be further opportunities to manage our deposit cost over the course of this year we still expect our core operating expenses to be up midsingle digits excluding card misclassificationrelated cost and merger expenses our core operating expense trends are in line with our expectations and we believe the actions we took in the first quarter have substantially derisked the probability of further increases to the remediation reserve we are tightening our net chargeoff range to to based largely on current delinquency trends our base case remains at the lower end of the range finally given the merger agreement we have suspended share repurchases through closing and agreed not to increase the dividend to summarize we continue to generate solid results and our financial performance underscores our steady stewardship of the organization as we move towards resolving compliance items and consummating our planned merger this concludes our remarks ill turn the call back over to our operator operator thank you this concludes todays call the discover investor relations team will
