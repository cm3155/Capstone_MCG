whove been working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country the structure of this call will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls after my opening remarks john will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve build ill then come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter here at discover our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees our headquarters functions moved to workfromhome on march with minimal disruption and our technology team and field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our discover call center team members working from the safety of their homes within two weeks our robust business continuity plans digital business model and usbased customer service helped ensure our representatives were ready even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 early on in the crisis we answered of calls in less than five minutes and for april as our team got more comfortable working from home average hold times have been under one minute we are providing significant support to our customers across every product to help them through this crisis weve expanded payment plans across our credit card student and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on cd early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength john will provide additional detail but im especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results specifically in sales volume and card loan growth for the company overall we generated a net loss of million or per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense as we adopted the cecl reserve methodology on january the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment actions we have taken since the crisis began include significant tightening of underwriting for new card and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification and weve pulled back on balance transfer offers and line increases as ive mentioned on prior calls for the last months we have been tightening credit at the margin as we have felt for some time that we are in late credit cycle but given the present environment we are adopting a significantly more cautious view to give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of our contingent liability meaning the total opentobuy for our card products has been reduced from roughly times loans to around times and the percentage of the portfolio below a fico score of has gone from at that time down to at the end of so while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the economy our portfolio is significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis in addition to our credit actions we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with the economic environment we are implementing approximately million of cost reductions over the remaining three quarters of and well continue to review expense levels as the economic environment evolves ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail then ill come back to discuss the current environment john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone before i begin i want to echo rogers thanks to all the people working on the front lines of the pandemic i also want to thank all of our discover associates they have pivoted to a work from home environment while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout today i will summarize the results for the quarter then provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions ill conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to roger to summarize our covid19 response actions in light of the uncertainty in the economy we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance but as roger mentioned we are targeting million of cost reductions through the balance of the year with the majority in discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 the second half our expense actions include reducing account acquisition expense cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities and reducing vendor and technology spend we will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed in the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of pandemic and our responses we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth payment volumes and revenue so you can indiscernible additional disclosures on slide to in the appendix of this presentation and as always we are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results on slide looking at key elements of the income statement revenue net of interest expenses increased this quarter driven primarily by a increase in average loans and a million net gain in our payment services segment principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment net interest margin was for the first quarter this was down basis points yearoveryear due largely to lower loan yields as the prime rate came down in response to fed rate cuts in september and october of last year this was partially offset by lower funding costs the additional fed rate cuts in march of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter provisions for credit losses include a net chargeoff of million up from last year and an increase in reserves of approximately billion reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook ill have some additional comments on credit in a moment but before we turn to the next slide i want to discuss operating expenses they were up from the prior year first quarter the increase was principally due to higher compensation expense increased marketing costs and investments in technology turning now to slide showing our key credit metrics credit performance remained stable in the first quarter we did not see any discernible impacts from the national covid19 containment activities or from our own credit mitigation actions in response card chargeoffs increased basis points from last years quarter due principally to seasoning of loan growth the credit card day delinquency rate was up basis points from last year but flat versus the prior quarter with both metrics reflecting consistent performance in typical seasonal patterns our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had stable credit performance in the quarter with both showing slight improvements in chargeoffs and delinquency rates on slide youll see our allowance for credit losses we added billion to the allowance for credit losses in january of this year as we transitioned to a life of loan cecl basis at the end of the quarter we added approximately billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast the reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than recovering through and a decline in gdp of nearly we also included our best estimate of the reserve implications of the government stimulus programs as the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear we will adjust our allowance accordingly turning to slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially mainly due to a decrease in loan balances partially offset by capital returns for purpose of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the cecl day one adjustment for two years so we will begin to phase in our day one cecl impacts in with phased in by the federal banking regulators have also provided discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 a phase in for the day two impacts of cecl with of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until and then treated the same as the day one deferral our payout ratio which includes buybacks was over the last months as roger noted we have suspended our share buyback program but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividend our liquidity position remains very strong as of the end of the quarter we had billion in liquid assets billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations and billion in borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of april our liquid assets have grown to more than billion in addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity we have access to funding through our directto consumer deposit channel with average deposits increasing yearoveryear and now making up over of total funding based on the strength of consumer demand yesterday we reduced rates on our savings accounts by basis points and will continue to look for opportunities to do so in summary good progress on the expense front liquidity is robust capital remains strong and we continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure and now ill turn the call back over to roger roger c hochschild president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks john while we will not be providing new guidance given the uncertain economic outlook i do want to provide you with an update on two key areas where the covid19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way that was not captured in the  results on slide were giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how covid19 has affected cardholder spending in april as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales the first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year so you can see where our cardholder spend is normally distributed by industry we then give you the yearoveryear growth percentages for the first quarter of and monthtodate april on a dayadjusted basis everyday sales which includes gas groceries and wholesale clubs and makes up about of total sales saw growth of during the quarter so far in april however everyday sales are down yearoveryear as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a reduction in spend in petroleum discretionary spend is down driven by the travel category which although only of cardholder spending is down and by retail which is down as long as stayathome orders remain in place and many businesses remain closed we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery turning to slide i want to take you through the skipapayment programs we have implemented to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty we recognize that covid19 has placed financial stress on the discover customers who may be out of work or have suffered reduced wages one of the key differences in this downturn compared to the great recession of has been the staggering pace of job loss but also discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of unemployment therefore we are offering support to those impacted by covid19 with skipapayment programs available across all of our products many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for a natural disaster through the first half of april we have enrolled over customers and roughly billion in receivables in skipa payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products the receivables enrolled now represent of total loans but we are encouraged that the number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late march we will continue to work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers needs let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the covid19 pandemic we have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide an industryleading customer experience across all of our products we have taken swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment continuing to lend but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts we are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our business over the long term and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves while our capital position is strong we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital base clearly we will have some challenging quarters ahead but im confident that we have taken the correct actions none of us can foresee when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the us economy to begin to recover but discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come we have a loyal customer base committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver longterm value to our customers and shareholders that concludes our formal remarks so i will turn the call back to our operator maria to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from bob napoli of william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning everybody hope everybodys well a question on the your outlook for unemployment and gdp since youre reserving for the life of the loans and i know you gave some numbers can you just go over those numbers for and what youre expecting as far as recovery and what effect will that have on loan growth john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thanks bob this is john ill take a shot at that so theres a wide degree of economic forecast that we took a look at while were building our models and ultimately our allowances so what we built in was unemployment peaking at and staying relatively high through the balance of this year so about through the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through so not expecting a real quick recovery and rather slow and our allowances has reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out and your second part of your question on loan growth so loan growth will be dependent on how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding as roger mentioned in his comments we have been cautious coming into this cycle and when the pandemic hit we pulled back further so loan growth will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc but we would expect to see loans declining i guess from here at least for the next quarter or two i mean is that fair roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services bob there are a lot of factors thatll go into where loans go certainly the retail spend numbers that i gave you will have a significant impact on that the credit action and expense actions weve taken will have an impact on loan growth as well but to johns point theres a lot of uncertainty thatll be determined by the pace of the recovery robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani of kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 thanks good morning and i hope you guys are doing well as well i guess its been pretty well documented that since the end of march some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse so could you just talk about how that might be contemplated in the future or whether or not you guys think it should be and then also how you guys are incorporating some of these skipapayment to cure rates and such inside your loss assumptions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thank you so as i said in my response to the last question theres a wide degree of variation on the estimate so when we put this together we were looking at what a likely scenario was now the economic backdrop continues to evolve so we certainly did consider that there are some overlays related to how we think about recoveries and certainly we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs but it is uncertain and if the economy deteriorates further and we dont see a recovery that will have reserve implications if it runs out as weve modeled that will also play through into the balance sheet and the pl so i know im not being real specific on your answer but at this point given the uncertainty this was our best estimate in terms of your second part of your question on skipapay so that though the nature of that program is for card is that an inbound call will happen the customer if theyre impacted by covid theyll get an automatic basically payment deferral they wont have to make the payment if they call back a second time they can get a second deferral on the payment and after that they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets and ultimately chargeoff so as we provisioned we thought about lifeofloan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics on the portfolio the one impact on skipapay is that if a customer is in trouble and isnt able to pay it will result in up to a twomonth deferral in the chargeoff just by the nature of how things roll but i do want to point out that just over of those customers who entered into the skipapay program were current at that time sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and just to clarify i guess the same forecasts you used for your assumptions in the first quarter have those actually been revised for the worse early into the second quarter and if everything remained the same would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision or are you saying that its really subjective based on sort of how youre seeing things unfold based on your own forecasts john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so theres a number of factor and im not trying to be elusive here sanjay but unemployment and gdp contraction are obviously key inputs the duration of the slowdown will also be important geographic input impacts are important job classes are important so ultimately it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery but just to go back and clarify my remarks so we assumed just over unemployment levels at a peak and then a very very slow recovery in and then coming in through roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 and sanjay just to build on that the reserve is calculated at point in time and so well go through a similar process next quarter my guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecasts between now and then and i would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions that is done on a near continuous basis and at a much more granular level and so were looking by industry sector were looking by geographic area were making decisions on who we book line assignment how much employment verification we do so i contrast the reserve calculation with how were managing credit which is near continuous sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah good morning thanks for taking the question it sounds like your macro assumptions were not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as kind of where unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery yet the card reserve reflects cumulative losses that are probably less than half of what you experienced in timeframe could you just talk about how the portfolio has changed in a manner that it makes you comfortable that losses wont approach what we saw in the last recession john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services theres a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed so roger mentioned this in his comments in terms of the opentobuy so the opentobuy has reduced by about billion from the last recession to this recession average fico scores in the portfolio have increased between and basis points which is a material change our underwriting frankly is far more sophisticated than it was years ago and frankly the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers was drastic and very very quick so i dont know if theres a perfect corollary between the last recession and this recession time will tell but certainly i feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action and again if the economic outlook changes well adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay fair enough thank you operator our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo don your line is open make sure youre not on mute donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 yes john trying to sort of tie you to a specific number on the stimulus is it realistic that you could have as youve looked at your scenarios maybe a point or two lower net chargeoffs from stimulus and then secondarily most financial institutions have said thered probably be another reserve build a sizable reserve build in  just wanted to i know youve talked a lot about it but is that the case as you sit here today in april john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so real difficult to answer at this point so were going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters in terms of the government stimulus programs the impact that we modeled was relatively modest so i dont know if i would go to a full percentage point on charge offs but there was a mild impact and as we see that unfold it will become more clear the key thing on the stimulus programs at least initially was with the unemployment checks going out in the ill say benefit thats a frontloaded impact and well have to see how things develop on the back half of the year donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you thats helpful operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of nomura bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thank you good morning roger and john i was hoping to follow up on your thoughts about the potential benefit from government relief programs specifically on the paycheck protection program can you comment on the idea that unemployed consumers who are receiving payments under ppp and therefore are not receiving unemployment insurance may be understating the true level of initial claims which you guys have always cited as an important leading indicator of credit performance and then if we extend that line of thinking how much of a concern is there that like those receiving unemployment insurance employees participating in ppp based on certainty about their employment outlook and still have to make decisions about which bills to pay first what that means for the unsecured credit card but just i guess the overall consensus view seems to be that ppp is a positive in the near term but its not a longer term fix and i was just hoping that you could maybe speak a little bit more to i guess the broad potential that the ppp program will benefit your loss experience and your confidence level on that thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i mean i think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit but given the depths of the decrease in economic activity what we all really need is for the economy to start back up again and that will depend on the pace of reopenings in different states and is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here some of the traditional relationships may break down a bit a lot of the initial unemployment claims have been driven by i would say entrylevel employees in retail restaurant and other industries that may have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base so there isnt necessarily even the same onetoone discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different and that job mix may change over time during this recession as well so i would summarize with the government programs are helpful but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so a lot of this will depend on the pace of the recovery bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thanks thats helpful i guess maybe if i could just follow up with a conceptual question on cecl i guess a different way of asking whats come up on the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate relative to your expectations at the end of  at a high level is it reasonable to expect that we will see additional reserve building and then therefore when conditions stop deteriorating well stop seeing additional reserve building and maybe kind of another way to ask that is if you can envision a scenario where you would need to continue to build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve just trying to kind of get just get the big picture idea of how cecl is going to work john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay so big picture if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate there will be two dynamics that are likely to happen one would be the cecl life of loan provisions would increase so the allowance would increase we would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio is stable and that the lending activity we were doing made sense so you could expect that the portfolio frankly might not increase and would actually decrease and if that were the case you would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size so theres multiple dynamics there that come into play but i hope thats conceptually helpful bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jason kupferberg of bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs sorry firstly this is mihir on for jason i wanted to ask about the forbearance programs and the skipapay are you also continuing some of your typical modification programs here and can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you lower credit limits available to borrow et cetera for those who seek either of these programs and just how you expect that to lead to like with the skipapay whether you will people be transitioning from that if they continue to grow through the delinquency buckets to your other modification programs or is it that once you do the skipapay now you arent eligible for some of those other programs just want to understand a little bit more on how youre dealing with some of the delinquencies thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah its roger let me try at a high level as john described for card its a twomonth program up to two months for skipapay but they do one month less than have renewed for the second month so well see how that plays out over time we do still have our program for customers that need a longer period of assistance regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers but again i think it really does depend on the pace of recovery as john pointed out over of those taking advantage of skipapay are current and so our hope would be and again thats why weve modeled it after some of the disaster relief programs weve traditionally had that they will require a shorter bridge and then will be able to get back to paying their bills if not we have longer term programs to assist them mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just sorry just to clarify on that one do you do anything with the longer with the skipapay theres no change to their credit limits available to borrows et cetera correct roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services no for those who have signed up for skipapay it does not impact their credit limits mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan hi guys thanks for taking my questions this morning thank you for all of the information on the skipapay im curious what youre seeing in terms of payment behaviors for consumers who arent on skipapay programs are you seeing an increase in consumers who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so were still indiscernible clear pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that youve seen what i would say is that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers and so its balanced in that way but what happens with payment rate i think will be determined on how quickly those sales ramp up some people making larger payments and you can see from the inflow into our deposit products there are a lot of households who are still okay but are looking to fortify their positions so id say its too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment rate richard shane q analyst jpmorgan discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 got it okay and look we share your view in looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of how the challenges emerge but one thing that historically has been subsequent to a natural disaster are significant insurance payments into those regions which create things like huge cash inflows weve seen deposit spikes associated with that i dont necessarily think that were going to see that this time is it your view that that will actually change the postevent payment behavior and credit characteristics roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services theres a lot of speculation out there in some ways this is like a natural disaster in other ways theres a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after a disaster you wont quite have that here and so is the economic people arent going to go to twice as many restaurants and so is that economic activity just lost i would say probably while you dont have the degree of insurance payments you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance and my guess is youll continue to see additional programs so that is probably a bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance richard shane q analyst jpmorgan got it hey thank you for taking my questions and we wish everybody there health and safety thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thanks rick craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks rick operator our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thanks just in regards to the liability side of the balance sheet i mean are you seeing changes in behavior on your deposit side and what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall deposit growth given the different the stimulus checks combined with stress across unemployment i know its difficult to really pinpoint it but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where you might actually see a little bit of pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline could you just give us a little idea on your expectations there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 yeah so i think supply and demand are starting to come into balance but its going to take another quarter or so the appetite for our deposit products has actually been very very good weve traditionally been second or third on the bank rate table we have been recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on the overall demand for our products so i think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash i think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels and decided that were a good spot and theyve chosen us so as we look forward in future ill say future quarters itll be subject to a couple of things so the supply and the demand factors what our competitors are doing and then obviously our own performance but we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pull back some of the nim that was impacted by the fed actions kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then in regards to some of the ph stimulus programs that you laid out with the million expense savings should we assume that thats off of what your previous guidance was or is that separate from what you indiscernible john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services no thank you yeah that was off the previous guidance and as we said when we issued that it was itd be based on a strict payback analysis so are we going to get longterm returns for the incremental investment with the economic backdrop changing we of course made the appropriate decisions kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks very much for taking my question your first question is where are we on utilization rates and average balances and how do that compare to maybe a period like entering the last recession roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services im sorry can you repeat the first part of that question john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services utilization roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services utilization rates so as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio i think we showed that the amount of contingent liability ie the ratio of which is kind of the opposite of utilization is significantly down from prior discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 years so one as part of the credit tightening that weve done over the last several years a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you and then im trying to quantify the effects of the rate changes in march how much of the impact to benchmark rates did you see in the quarter i know it was later in the quarter and what do we think about nim trends over the next quarter or two john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay so we didnt see any impact in the quarter from the fed reductions at the end of march so there was about basis points of reduction so were not giving guidance but im going to give you a couple points in terms of how to think about it so the basis points hit so theres an impact for three quarters of the year on that our deposit betas have traditionally been about we took some proactive steps early in the year reducing overall deposit rates by to basis points depending on the product and then were pulling back on the promo mix which should also help rate so you put those factors together and i think it draws a picture of how nim could look for the year now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on whats happening in the particular quarter on revolver and transactor mix john hecht q analyst jefferies llc perfect thank you guys very much operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks roger maybe as you kind of sit and think and obviously youre going to be doing less marketing but youre going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products and as you think about discovers product set and service niche kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where there are opportunities to capitalize and maybe if you could also just throw in thoughts on rewards competition in this environment as well thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks moshe for the question one of the things were trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in this environment and so even as weve made cuts we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen discover build the brand and make sure were in great shape for the future so were excited about the partnership with quibi that just launched products such as our miles card where you have the ability to redeem at amazon and paypal thats a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 our third quarter promotion is for restaurants for the program we think that will resonate very very well and our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios so for example issuers that have big sign up bonuses theyre having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending so were very excited about where our products are positioned weve talked a lot about the traction were getting in deposits i also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee and were the only one with only no annual fee products so were really excited about some of the opportunities were seeing in this environment moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great i would assume that you would expect better whether its a response rate or conversion rates and things like that in this while marketing is lower you might have some of that so roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah were seeing and some of it plays out in the personal loan space for example some of the traditional competitors in the fintechs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very very aggressively so even with reduced marketing were still hoping to generate good results moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning and thanks for all the comments couple of questions just one earlier i think you mentioned something about how this recession is going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick job losses and then expected recoveries do you know the job types by customer that you have roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services we get it at the time of underwriting so some of it can drift over time it varies a bit by product we have much better information for the personal loan customers as an example we dont have for our student loan customers they havent been employed so it does vary but i would say we have very strong for personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then separately on the reserving as you know folks like us were looking at the reserve levels relative to the bankrun stress test just to get a sense as to how youre comping this upcoming recession versus that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago and when we look at that the credit card reserve that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 youve taken is running if my math is right around 45ish percent of that stress loss period but the other consumer is running much higher on other consumer products i think it averages around high low so i was just wondering is there a reason why you feel this tough kind of recession is going to be tougher on that other consumer and does it have to do with your answer you just gave or is there anything else there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i would probably say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different stresses a lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in so just comparing scenarios based on peak loss can give you different numbers so i wouldnt say its anything different were seeing by asset class its more technical based on those scenarios betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just two other quick ones when people sign up for skipapay and lets say they go for the one month is it automatic that they can go for the two months or they have to call in every time or check it on the e mail john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes betsy they have to call in on the card side betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right and i guess with the call times being extremely low thats not going to be a challenge for them and then lastly on the forbearance side or the callins that youve been receiving from the slide deck obviously it showed that the beginning of april was the peak and i got a few questions in overnight why do you think thats the case that the requests for skipapay have already started to decelerate at a time when unemployment claims are still rising here john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thats a good question some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs and then it could be just the cycle we do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pickup as they approach into the second month for certain customers but well have to see roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i guess i would probably point to a people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even before theyre actually unemployed and so they may have called us knowing that their boss said hey weve got one week left and then were closing down so there isnt necessarily that line of sight the second thing my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process as opposed to each week million people are losing their jobs and so thats why we would have seen the bubble earlier because we didnt have that same capacity constraint that i believe youve seen around unemployment claims discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay that would be great it would be great to update that as you get in front of people to over the quarter thanks operator our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning guys one quick question i guess on the skipapay payment can you guys give further demographics i guess on what youre seeing in these customers i mean is it safe to assume that the lower fico score customers are the ones currently enrolling in these skipapay payments or is that too much of a generalization roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i would say we talked about over for card at least over are current they are relatively highly utilized in terms of the amount of balance but theres actually a mix of some that are transactors as well historically in that so thats probably the information were willing to provide at this time meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right thank you craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services maria our last question operator our next question comes our last question comes from
