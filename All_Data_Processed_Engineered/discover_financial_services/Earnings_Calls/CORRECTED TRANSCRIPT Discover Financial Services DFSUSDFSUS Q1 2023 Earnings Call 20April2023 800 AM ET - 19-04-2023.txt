environment we reported first quarter net income of billion or per share we had an alltime record quarter in terms of consumer deposit inflows leveraging our award winning digital experience and our leading customer service and were improving key elements of our guidance as we look to the remainder of we may adjust our outlook as conditions evolve we believe there is a potential for more stringent regulation we believe were well positioned for more rigorous regulatory capital and liquidity requirements given our strong internal standards and we also continue to focus on enhancing our compliance management systems this past quarter we also included an important milestone with respect to our investment in human capital were honored to have been recognized as one of fortunes best

digital bank ill now turn the call over to john to review our results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill start with our financial summary results on slide our performance this quarter was characterized by strong revenue growth continued credit normalization a slight change to our outlook on the macroeconomic environment resulting in a reserve increase and a yearoveryear increase in expenses lets review the details starting on slide net interest income was up million yearoveryear or our net interest margin continued to expand benefiting from higher prime rates partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances nim ended the quarter at up basis points from the prior year discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 and basis points sequentially receivables growth was driven by card which increased yearoveryear reflecting stable sales growth modest new account growth and payment rate moderation sales increased in the period slightly higher than the growth we experienced in the prior quarter and down from the growth we experienced in sales growth so far in april is a modest but this is coming off a very high comp of in april of last year new card account growth decelerated reflecting the tightening of underwriting standards over the past several months but grew by from the prior year the impact of slowing sales growth on receivable expansion was offset by decreases in payment rates the card payment rate decreased basis points in the quarter and is currently slightly over basis points above the prepandemic level turning to our noncard products personal loans were up driven by higher originations over the past year and lower payment rates we continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting of this product organic student loan receivables grew by largely driven by a reduction in the payment rate in terms of funding mix consumer deposit balances were up yearoveryear and sequentially as roger highlighted we achieved record quarterly deposit growth deposits now make up of our total funding mix with over insured and we continue to target to deposit funding over the medium term outside of deposits our funding channels remain open and at attractive costs as an example in early april we issued billion of card abs fixed rate notes this offering was upsized and our spread was basis points tighter than our november securitization additionally we recently received a ratings upgrade by moodys for our bank subsidiary and our banking holding company moodys cited a number of reasons to support this upgrade including our prudent underwriting conservative risk management and resiliency in an economic downturn looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was partially due to a million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to an million loss this quarter adjusting for these our noninterest income was up primarily driven by loan fee income and higher net discount and interchange revenue moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and down from the prior quarter compensation costs were up primarily due to increased head count and wage inflation marketing expenses increased million or as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products professional fees increased million or driven by investments in technology and increases in consulting activities that support our consumer compliance initiatives even with these increases our efficiency ratio was and we generated about basis points of operating leverage in the period moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter in the card portfolio the net chargeoff rate of was basis points higher than the prior year and basis points higher sequentially consistent with our commentary back in january we expect the seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years and normalization of older vintages to a more typical loss rate these trends remain consistent with our expectations discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide this quarter we increased our allowance by million and our reserve rate increased by basis points to this increase in reserve rate was driven by two factors about basis points reflects the runoff of seasonal transactor balances that we typically experienced in the fourth quarter the remaining portion was largely driven by deterioration in our expectations of the macroeconomic environment we increased our expectations for the yearend employment rate to the midpoint of our to range this change reflects the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth we will continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions and make adjustments to our expectations looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was and we repurchased billion of common stock during the quarter the net unrealized loss on our afs securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was million the impact on our regulatory capital if our oci optout were not allowed would have been about basis points our capital position remains robust and well ahead of regulatory requirements we continue to prioritize investment in strong organic growth and returning excess capital to shareholders included in our press release was the announcement that our board of directors approved a new billion share repurchase program for the five quarters ending june and increased our common stock dividend by to per share including on slide with our outlook following the strong first quarter performance we are raising our expectations for loan growth this year to be low to midteens theres no change to our nim forecast we are maintaining our guidance for operating expenses to be less than however we do see risk of upward pressure on this from collection and customer service expense related to growth in our lending and deposit accounts and professional service support and continued investment in technology we are targeting our expected range of net chargeoffs to to based on our current delinquencies and roll rates this represents a reduction to the top end of the range by basis points finally as mentioned our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization weve returned substantial excess capital over the past two years and we anticipate moving towards a more standard cadence of share buybacks over the second half of this year to conclude our first quarter results have given us significant momentum into this year and were well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives with that ill turn the call back to our operator to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning john quick question on the reserve commentary you had just to be clear i know you guys had a waiting of scenarios and it sounds like the low end went from to when we average that out between all the scenarios does that take you above the unemployment rate assumption or how should we think about that and also just in terms of the narrowing of the range of the chargeoffs this quarter was that more because the unemployment rate hasnt necessarily panned out the way you expected it to meaning its coming in better john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay yeah ill start with the reserve portion of the question and then swing over to the charge off aspect so as we mentioned we run a number of different scenarios so we looked at unemployment ranges from to north of we centered around a range between and for and then a slight improvement in and that was essentially the driver of the increase in the reserve rate outside of the basis points i talked about in my prepared remarks related to kind of transactors running off as they typically do in the first quarter so hopefully that clarifies your question or clarifies any questions you have on reserves related to chargeoffs so theres a couple of factors there the first and what i would say is the most important is that the portfolio is performing almost exactly as we expected it to in terms of chargeoff roll rates and delinquencies so were generally pleased with that as each month and quarter goes by we have better line of sight to what we expect the total year to be our internal kind of roll rate models basically can take a very very good look at six months forward and then we move to more advanced models for anything beyond that so as the first quarter passed through great line of sight through september and then beyond september weve relied on our analytical models so thats essentially the reason why were able to tighten the chargeoff guidance from the upper end and each quarter well give an update on that certainly sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i guess first you talked about kind of slowing of new account growth could you kind of roger perhaps drill down a little more into the drivers i guess in terms of what youre seeing either in the competitive environment or in the consumer kind of credit environment discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so ill start the credit the competitive environment remains robust right most of our key competitors in the card business are the larger money center banks well capitalized lot of deposits so cards tends to always be competitive i think what youre seeing are the results of some of the changes weve made in credit policy weve talked about tightening at the margin and then also some very tough comps over the growth we saw last year so we feel really good about the new accounts were booking but also believe our credit policy is appropriate for the current environment moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and maybe can you talk john maybe talk a little bit more about the expense comment that you made how much of that would be tied to revenue growth if expenses were higher john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so as i said in the prepared remarks weve maintained a less than guidance although were seeing a little bit of pressure on those lines i mentioned so in terms of marketing what we said in january was that we expected marketing to be up double digits we still expect that to be the case despite the reduction in the rate of growth of new accounts we are still seeing good opportunities to generate positive account growth with an appropriate risk tolerance the other portion of that marketing spend will be to roll out the cash back debit program which we anticipate to be rolled out late in the second quarter maybe early in the third quarter so were going to put some substantial dollars behind that to generate some activity both new account generation as well as awareness of the product and the product features that we think will help build continue to build our strong deposit franchise operator thank you our next question will come from bob napoli with william blair your line is open robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning the slowdown in spend growth that you called out in the month of april i was wondering if you could give i know its tough comps versus a year ago but just any color on what youre seeing on that front and then any change in your view of the health of the consumer roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so i would say that the slowdown is pretty broadbased and is really a continuation of the trend if you look at the quarter itself overall sales growth was a little over but march it had dropped to so broadbased across all categories i think some of it is just a reduction in the pressures from inflation but also youve got some tough comps in terms of last april sales were up yearoveryear for us the most important thing for the consumer is the strength of the job market and that remains pretty robust so while we are tightening credit and continuing along that overall the consumer is still holding up pretty well discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you then just any more color on the cashback debit product and what do you believe that will i guess do for you strategically just any thoughts on i know you guys have been doing a lot of work on it over the years and it seems like youre ready to really roll with it roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no that its a product were really excited about offering cash back on debit transactions is virtually unique its something that no big bank can match we take advantage of having a proprietary payments network and one of the outcomes from the pandemic is consumers even for their primary checking or debit account are a lot more comfortable dealing with the direct bank so this is going to be a critical initiative not just for this year but for many years to come and part of our transition to being way more than credit cards personal loans student loans home equity but being the true leading digital bank robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question this morning roger when you look at the credit outlook and you updated the nco guidance im curious about some of the puts and takes you see in terms of sort of the internals of numbers whether its roll rates utilization payment rates what do you see out there that is the most constructive and whats your whats the factor that gives you the most pause roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah it varies for new accounts versus what we look for on our portfolio for the portfolio side yeah its hard to pick an individual factor given the complexity of the models we use but certainly overall levels of indebtedness their behavior in terms of payments the amount of payment we even look at when a payment comes in during the month so given that were still focused on growth i would say in general the consumers are doing well but we have continued to tighten and its something we look at every account every day across all of our different products richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and is there one metric you might point to that kind of your when you get your daily reports you scan to right away to because its a concern for you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah so you may find this hard to believe but there are very few numbers i look at on a daily basis im lucky to have an amazing team and so i can look at it a little less frequently but you cant point to a single number we have a composite behavioral score that i see on a lot of our internal risk reporting but again there are literally countless variables in some of our most complex machine learning models that are evaluating portfolio credit richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah hi this is jeff adelson on for betsy good morning john i just wanted to follow up on the comment about the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth i know that was more of a macro overlay comment but just wanted to understand maybe where you think discover is going to fit into that potential tightening regime i know youre already doing some tightening slowing account growth on your side but just wondering do you see yourself at some point this year taking a more meaningful cut maybe what would cause you to revisit the loan growth that youre seeing today john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks for the question jeff so as we look at loan growth for we feel very very positive and thats why we moved the loan growth range up a bit so in terms of the overall lending environment and what would trigger additional cuts it would be meaningful changes to the unemployment outlook meaningful changes in the number of job openings and then further signs of stress within the consumers so that would within the portfolio itself it would be payment rates timing of payments we take a look at flow rates from one bucket to another so those would all be certainly signs as well as kind of the broader indications of delinquency and the rate of chargeoff on a vintage basis but as we look at things right now ph unemployment i believe will continue to be strong right so we have strong growth in the healthcare sector manufacturing sector defense oil and gas and onshoring of supply chain continues so my sense is that were not going to have any seismic changes to unemployment despite the fed tightening action so that means that well look at continue to look at things around the margins and make good calls to ensure that the accounts were putting on are profitable and the accounts that are in the portfolio that we have early warning triggers so that our customer service and collection folks can reach out to ensure that collections and cash flows remain strong jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 thank you and one followup i just want to have on expenses and technology investment theres been a lot of focus out there on ai and some advances in that technology i know discover has been pretty nimble and investing on its own in that space but just wondering is there anything audio gap john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services hello jeff or operator is the line open operator yes his line is still open john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay eric wasserstrom a vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services hey jeff i think we missed the last a little bit of your question but i think it was essentially about the use of ai so john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so why dont i ill take that briefly and jeff or betsy we can follow up separately in the afternoon if you like so in terms of investing in technology so theres three theres ill call it three or four different strengths the first is to ensure we have leadingedge capabilities which would include machine learning ai second is ensure that our core systems are robust and resilient and third around the network making sure that our network continues to have leading edge or at a minimum market global capabilities so those are the tiers and we continue to invest in those aspects as well as technology to support our overall compliance management system as we talked about in the prepared remarks so overall its an area of investment were a digital institution we need to continue to invest in technology to ensure that we keep capabilities advancing okay thank you operator thank you our next question will come from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey thanks so much and good morning i would imagine that discover given the prudence of the way you run your franchise has really strong kyc and i think some of the fintech players are actually having some difficulty there and so id love to hear you talk about your checklist for opening an account and is there a difference for kyc when you issue a debit card versus extending credit with a credit card and i just have a followup thanks so much guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah great question so amlbsa kyc is one element of compliance there are many others that we focus on first thing id say is our task might be a little easier just given that we dont handle much cash not having branches we dont have huge private net worth operations much outside the us but it is a key area of focus theres a pretty big overlap between what were required to do from a kyc standpoint and actually what we do ourselves to tackle fraud a huge amount of the new fraud attacks do come via identity theft and while there are certain nuanced differences by product very very similar in terms of what we do when someone is opening a new credit card account versus opening a checking or a debit account dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thanks thank you very much and i guess kind of a double question here but how closely aligned is your cecl unemployment rate and thus reserve outlook correlated with your net chargeoff guidance is there a possibility that i mean you had mentioned before that you dont expect unemployment rate to rise very much is there a chance that there could be actually a disconnect between the cecl reserve and company nco outlooks thank you so much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks dominick so yeah we have a process that we take great pains to make sure theres no disconnects between our outlook on kind of chargeoffs over call it a three quarter or a four quarter period and the cecl reserves which is life of loan losses which would include chargeoffs through the life of the relationship and the modeling systems that we use are essentially the same same tools same people kind of managing those and a bunch of work to ensure that the organization so each of the functions credit and the risk management systems and finance and accounting are on the same page in terms of what were trying to accomplish here so theres no chance of disconnect here at discover i will say that the difference in terms of the tightening of our chargeoff outlook in terms of updated guidance and what happened in the reserve has a couple of factors that are at play there the first is were talking about a threequarter period of forecasting on the chargeoffs and we gave a fairly wide range which we intend to tighten as each quarter passes on the reserves we take a number of different factors including the macro environment portfolio and then theres certainly a level of management judgment that we use to ensure that we have an appropriate reserve under financial accounting standards so thats essentially a quick sketch of the process that we use dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc excellent thanks so much for taking my questions have a good day john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you operator thank you our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc hi this is nate richam on for mihir bhatia quick question for me are you seeing any changes in the credit quality for new applicants i understand that youre tightening credit and underwriting but just curious to see how those consumers are asking for loans now versus a year or two ago roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes i mean its a tricky question to answer because it varies by channel obviously we did quite a lot of pre approved marketing so we kind of set the criteria who applies and even within our nonpreapproved channels we tend to be targeted so havent seen i would guess a huge difference in terms of applicant profile but our new account profile has tended to improve as weve tightened credit nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc okay great and then as a quick followup can you just talk about the vintage performance like how are card loan vintages from like through performing versus the loans we were seeing prepandemic roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think in general john mentioned all of the vintages are performing as expected and so total losses are still normalizing in line with what we forecast so i would say continued strong performance across the board and we havent seen huge differences in behavior by vintage nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you operator thank you our next question will come from mark devries with barclays your line is open roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services hey mark i think your line is open hey chelsie well come back to mark offline operator okay yes sir and as at this moment there are no further questions in the queue so i would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services great well if there are any additional questions please reach out to us here at the ir team
