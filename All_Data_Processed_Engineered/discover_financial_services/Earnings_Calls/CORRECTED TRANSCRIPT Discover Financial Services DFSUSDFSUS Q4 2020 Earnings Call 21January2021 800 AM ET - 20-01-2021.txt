the value and resilience of our digital banking business model while the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive our business stood up to these challenges and we are in million after tax for the fourth quarter and over billion for the full year our fourth quarter results underscored the capital generation of our model while our revenues were down year overyear our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses enabled us to exit the year with a roe in the fourth quarter looking back on the full year our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team we proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment including changes in consumer spending patterns repayment trends and borrowing habits discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 discover has always provided bestinclass customer service and this did not change with the pandemic while other issuers face significant challenges with long hold times there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our us based customer service we kept average hold times under minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly return to normal levels of under minute additionally our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly all employees continuing to workfromhome since midmarch similarly our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base positioned us well as we enter this period of economic stress we also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases and we added billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated as expected the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased yearoveryear however we took substantial market share in private student lending and gained share in card lending our digital bank operating model combined with disciplined expense management has historically generated industryleading efficiency but in we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut million from planned expenses despite absorbing several onetime items that have occurred during the year excluding the onetime items expenses were down nearly yearoveryear we achieved this while still investing in analytics automation and core technology capabilities to support long term growth and efficiency improvement for example weve invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and interactions our payments business was also well positioned heading into last years sudden economic decline our pulse debit business had a strong year with volume up from reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic our discover proprietary network was down for the year but exited the fourth quarter at plus in line with card sales volume while diners club volume declined reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global te spending we signed five new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance as we look into we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the economic recovery and some of the impacts from last years downturn have yet to be fully realized for this reason we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year nonetheless we see reasons for optimism after bottoming in april our card sales steadily rebounded throughout the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter we saw improvement across all categories especially in grocery and retail which now represent more than half of our sales mix this favorable sales trend has also continued into the first half of january in this environment we will remain disciplined on expense management but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to levels we also anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return earlier this week our board of directors approved a discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 new billion share repurchase plan and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter subject to the federal reserves limitations in conclusion presented us with unparalleled challenges but our business model has well positioned and i couldnt be more pleased with how the team here at discover responded i am confident that the actions we took strengthened our business and will drive longterm value for our shareholders and customers while there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery i am optimistic that will be better year ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill walk through our fourth quarter results starting on slide we earned million in net income or per share these results included several onetime expenses totaling million excluding these eps would have been there were a number of factors both positive and negative that influenced our performance during the year importantly our results for reflect proactive management of our funding and operating costs and our conservative approach to credit management these factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes however were seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin in the fourth quarter net interest income was down reflecting a decline in average receivables and lower loan yields this was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit cost noninterest income was lower driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the category this quarter a onetime writeoff of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the yearoveryear decrease the provision for credit losses was million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance there was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter whereas the prior year included an million reserve build operating expenses increased yearoveryear driven by onetime items related to software writeoffs charges for penalties and restitution and cost of a voluntary early retirement program compensation expense also contributed to the increase these were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional fees excluding onetime items expenses were down from the prior year turning to loan growth on slide total loans were down from the prior year driven by a decrease in card receivables lower card receivables were the result of three factors first payment rates continue to be elevated while this has reduced loan balances it has had a favorable impact of credit performance second promotional balances have continued to decline due to actions we took early in the pandemic to tighten credit and third an increase in transactor activity looking at our other lending products in student loans we had a strong peak origination season increasing market share and leading to loan growth personal loans were down as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 moving to slide net interest margin continued to improve up basis points from the prior year and basis points from the prior quarter to compared to the third quarter lower deposit pricing was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest margin we cut our online savings rate another basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower online savings rates 12month and month cds are all down to basis points lower interest chargeoffs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter these factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that we are currently carrying while this is depressing our net interest margin today it should benefit margin as we deploy this liquidity into future loan growth average consumer deposits increased from the prior year we continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products which were up billion from the prior quarter all of the growth from the third quarter was from indeterminate maturity accounts which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate decreases turning to slide we continue to optimize our funding mix and our goal remains to have to of our funding from deposits we also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next couple years both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters looking at slide as roger noted we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least million during the year and im pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several onetime expense items that occurred in total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased million or from the prior year driven completely by million in onetime expense items excluding these operating expenses would have been down million or yearoveryear yet even as we remain disciplined on cost we continue to invest in analytical capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements looking at some of the individual line items employee compensation was up million or driven by a one time item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits marketing and business development expense was down million or most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to the changing economic environment professional fees decreased million or mainly driven by lower thirdparty recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity on slide you can see our credit metrics for the quarter once again credit performance was very strong and total chargeoffs below and credit card net chargeoffs ph near the card net chargeoff rate was basis points lower than the prior year while the net chargeoff dollars were down million or compared to the third quarter net card chargeoff rate declined basis points the 30plus delinquency rate was basis points lower than last year and increased basis points from the prior quarter credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio with net chargeoffs down basis points yearoveryear excluding purchased loans that 30plus delinquency rate improved basis points from the prior year and basis points compared to the prior quarter in our personal loan portfolio net chargeoffs were down basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points yearoveryear discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 to wrap up credit this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products driven by the actions weve taken in underwriting line management and collections the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus we believe that losses will increase in the second half of and into however the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance or material shifts in the economic environment moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide we held allowance flat to the prior quarter while the macro environment has improved the outlook remains uncertain similar to our past approach weve modeled several different economic scenarios the primary assumptions in our economic model were a year end unemployment rate of about and gdp growth of about we did not include any additional stimulus beyond what has already been provided to consumers our economic scenarios also considered the increasing number of covid cases the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase in unemployment claims turning to slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially to remaining above our internal target and well above regulatory minimums we have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at per share regarding share repurchases as roger indicated earlier this week we received authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to billion of common stock and we intend to begin share buybacks in the first quarter subject to the federal reserves regulatory limitations moving to slide and some perspectives on how to think about we anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year we see opportunities for customer acquisitions but the level of growth will be dependent on payment rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery with respect to our net interest margin as i previously mentioned we expect we will continue to see benefits to margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding we also remain committed to disciplined expense management and well continue to invest to drive profitable longterm growth and efficiency improvement this includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition as well as investments in advanced analytics and technology capabilities in terms of credit performance as ive already noted we expect losses to increase in the second half of and remain elevated into finally our capital allocation strategy has not changed and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in summary we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio net interest margin expansion driven by lower funding costs flat reserves and excluding onetime items operating expenses were down yearoveryear im very pleased with our execution throughout and discovers efforts to protect employees and provide uninterrupted bestinclass service to our customers the quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and our investment in core capabilities protected and strengthened the discover franchise in the challenges we face demonstrate the resiliency of discovers digital banking business model and while uncertainty remains we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover with that ill turn the call back to our operator maria to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from moshe orenbuch from credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and welcome eric and if craig is listening its been a pleasure working with you too i guess both roger and john you talked about the idea of increasing marketing expenses into could you just kind of flesh that out a little bit talk some about how much youd like to grow accounts what youre looking for what signals would drive you to step on the gas a little harder or pull your foot off and because youve seen some of your competitors already start to spend the marketing we dont know yet what thats generated but maybe just talk about that a little bit john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes thanks moshe so you saw how were thinking about the expense base for and then ill talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth so in terms of expenses the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the midterm now opportunities in will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition but in terms of the overall expense base there will be incremental dollars for marketing new customer acquisition and thirdparty recovery fees as courts reopen we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts so outside of those areas were targeting to keep expenses flat across the business now certain accounts may go higher certain may go lower but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives incremental spend the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down in terms of new account growth what were targeting is midsingledigits maybe if were fortunate we see some opportunities upper singledigit account growth and we hope that will translate into increased loan balances we didnt give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there and frankly repayment trends have been pretty remarkable ph and with potential new round of stimulus that could further increase the repayment trends so thats how were thinking about growth in expenses so if theres a followup we could take a quick followup if not well head on to the next question moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani of kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 thanks good morning and my congratulations to eric and craig as well wanted to drill down on the credit quality and reserve assumptions i understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying unemployment rate however i think moodys has been improving their unemployment assumptions and that rate is declining sort of in the second half of this year and into im just curious sort of how to put sort of your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels those embedded in the reserve assumptions and at what point do you reassess that is there something seeing inside your portfolio thats leading you to be more conservative thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thanks sanjay so ill take this one as well so first let me start off by saying were very pleased with the portfolios performance so the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong so in terms of the modeled assumptions so in my script i talked about unemployment at the end of i realize thats higher than where we are today from a reported number and we also assumed gdp growth of now there are some folks forecasting an increase in gdp as well so as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet theres a couple of things that we took into account so first is the overall unemployment numbers theres about million people out of work theres another million people that arent included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they havent actively looked for work in the past four weeks so to me where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative we didnt feel like we had enough data points at this point given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter given a life of loan reserving assumption but i can say this were going to continue to look at our portfolio and in the macro environment were going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment so were seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus so today were well positioned and were going to continue to reassess it first quarter second quarter and into the second half of next year and make appropriate adjustments sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning and congratulations eric and craig when i saw the im hoping youre listening and when i saw the voluntary early retirement i hope youre a reasonable chunk of that number we sorry when you think about what youve said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts that makes sense there will presumably be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts historically when you started to grow the portfolio again its been led by wallet share gains and line limit increases im curious when you think you might take that sort of brownout on line limit increases off and how we should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so ill start on the rewards rate we tend to keep our rewards program very stable it provides a lot of value and so while youve seen competitors make dramatic changes we feel like our leadership position in cash rewards serves well so we have in the past talked about a low singledigit increase in rewards rate due to structural changes that will likely continue but beyond that we feel very good about where were positioned in the competitiveness of our program in terms of growth its always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio and so it will remain that going forward in terms of what would get us to loosen credit i think many of the indicators that john talked about right so getting better line of sight in the direction of white collar employment is probably the most critical one richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thank you ive got a followup to sanjays question clearly the credit performance youve experienced so far is much better than you would have expected just given all of the different macro assumptions and so my question is what do you think you need to see in the data before you feel comfortable releasing reserves john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thanks mark so first will be the performance of the portfolio so whats happening on specific roll rates are they holding are they deteriorating consistent with what our modeled expectations are broad macro is going to be important we also do know that if theres another round of stimulus that will which isnt baked into our reserve assumptions we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors certainly delinquency repayment rate and ultimately chargeoffs and required provisions so well keep an eye on that roger and i both talked about white collar employment levels and tax will also be new jobless claims so putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is performing will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 hi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a couple of questions on the buybacks that you announced i just wanted to understand if the buyback announced like what kind of cet1 youre thinking about when you are putting forth that buyback estimate and then the second question is related to that has to do with whether or not youve embedded reserve releases in your estimates for that i mean because ph in this fourth quarter its trailing federal right now at kind of circle of reference there so wanted to understand how youre thinking about reserve releases and what your target cet1 is john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay so we continue to target in terms of how we thought about buybacks this year the first piece i would say is we wanted to ensure were prudent with our capital given the level of uncertainty we do have the fed constraints in terms of the fourquarter average of net income and so the first quarter and well the second quarter and first quarter of are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of and then were also thinking about the cecl transition impact which will be somewhere between and basis points as we think about cet1 so ultimately we didnt want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope we felt that billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty and that will take a dent out of the what ill say is the excess capital that we have right now but our earnings power will be really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then just separately a followup question here on how youre thinking about the interchange rate i mean theres been a couple of theres been some pressure on it recently after years of improving i just wanted to understand is the recent behavior more of a shortterm phenomenon less te or is there something else going on that we should be thinking about more modeling out that one john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so the fourth quarter did come down a little bit and we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull away from the traditional online or excuse me the brickandmortar retailers to the online retailers which certainly impacted it but from our perspective very well aligned with our categories in the fourth quarter discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 which also drove incremental sales through our card and ultimately we think it will translate into other forms of revenue specifically interest income as balances revolve betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so this quarter was primarily the cashback on the dotcoms that got obviously utilized very very fully john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah operator our next question comes from line of bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning just to echo my congratulations to eric and craig i wanted to ask about the net interest margin and i believe the is the highest weve ever seen can you talk about whether the trough is behind us how sustainable this level is and the extent to which you see room margins to actually expand from here given the room for deposit repricing and remixing towards lower cost deposits that you see from here john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes sure bill so from the trough our second half nim improved by nearly basis points incredible so obviously we cant run that trajectory in perpetuity so a way to think about that is that we ended the fourth quarter at the that you just mentioned my view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing especially if theres another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the competition for deposits will further abate now how much ultimately we have room we have there uncertain is it 20ormore bps to be determined but in my view at least bps very conservative view the maturity profile we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that well see there and then so frankly some things that are pushing against net interest margin especially in the second half of the year if the credit losses do accelerate as weve indicated that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 so broadly speaking we do see further room for expansion there but i would jump from the fourth quarter number and do those steps i just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks john thats very helpful operator our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning roger if you could comment on what you think about the sort of longterm growth rate of the card business if its been impacted by you have a lot of new areas like personal loans you have buy now pay later is this stuff just on the edges or do you think that this has some impact on the growth of the card industry and could you be wrong on that i guess and could some of these new initiatives in fintech be more impactful roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i certainly could be wrong so ill say that upfront but we have not seen either of those have an impact on card loan growth and youve seen that in the past whether its been a home equity loan boom where a lot of people are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt a lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card debt that they are comfortable with certainly our base and they tend to revert back to that amount and so buy now pay later is the most recent trend thats out there were looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances so in my decades in this business theres always something thats going to kill off credit cards but so far the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid now it is a mature business but we also as we think about our growth its a combination of where the industry goes but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportion of student and young adults who are coming into the industry and so we feel good about that donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good morning just wanted to followup on your guidance for losses to increase in the second half of and then likely remain elevated into i mean are you envisioning just given the current economic environment that these are likely that were going to have a plateau in or is it going to be like a slow decline after we peak in the second half of just given what your view is on the economy and how things are playing out so far discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah okay so at this point theres a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak chargeoffs and what weve seen as weve gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods and essentially thats what were seeing today its hard to believe given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment ranks that arent in the unemployment number that there isnt going to be some material impact to credit and chargeoffs at some point the roll rates were seeing right now in terms of from aging buckets one to the next are incredibly strong which is positive so that means by itself there cant be an acceleration of chargeoffs in at least in the first four months of the year beyond that you would expect given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate chargeoffs will increase and continue to increase until theres absolute stability so were seeing a peak in late and that could carry through into and then moderate as the indiscernible and the economic the broad macros improve so thats how were thinking about it im not sure if weve got it right if we dont were going to adjust accordingly kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then the followup on your comments about targeting to keep expenses flat across the business is that relative to account growth or is that saying yearoveryear absolute expenses will remain flat in john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so i want to be careful here it wasnt absolute expenses so what i tried to do is distinguish between those expenses that will help us accelerate growth and we expect those to increase those that arent targeted to accelerate growth we expect will remain flat to down we expect if you go through kind of line items of the expense base salaries and wages weve done some things this year to level that off including the voluntary early retirement program we have activated our procurement organization around thirdparty spend and weve driven a lot of productivity through that we have looked at every single line item on the expense base and were making determinations on whether or not those expenses will help us drive longterm growth if the answer is yes maybe will increase if the answer is no theyre going to be flat to down kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co so just to be clear those expenses that are driving growth should they be in line with account growth or be above or below just dependent upon what youre seeing underlying the business roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 so maybe one way of looking at that for card new accounts as an example we expect our cost per account to be below what we saw in and thats with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits were seeing from some of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of bob napoli of william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you good morning i think ive said goodbye to craig like at least eight times over the last few decades i dont think its going to be the last one for some reason but good luck roger just i mean so the world has come discovers direction if you would i think the digital banking branches banking structure that you have and then you have the unique asset of the network obviously but what are you working on theres a lot of changes while the markets come your direction theres a lot of new businesses direct banks digital banks and development of companies like venmo or private companies chime are there things that youre doing as you look at this to be on offense to expand the ecosystem of your products and services to try to get direct deposits to get more of a transaction banking accounts as well what are you doing on the banking side with all of the innovation in the market where is discover investing roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so great question if the world is coming your way youve got to keep moving to stay ahead and so that is our focus weve always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards but more recently with everything from the fico score on statements ability to freeze your account and so you can rest assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer driven innovation across all of our products specifically in the deposit side we think theres a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts it will be a while before they become a material part of our funding base but with our low cost direct to consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the durbin interchange caps because we own our proprietary network were uniquely positioned for a bank over billion and so it isnt maybe the primary focus right now just given the excess level of fundings but it is a critical initiative and we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branchbased banks but also against any of the new fintech players robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc okay thank you id love some color on what else youre thinking about there but as you look at the your customers the customers that youre adding is there any change in the demographic mix of the new customers youre adding theres a lot of times we are getting commentary or questions around well the millennials are not going to borrow on their credit cards the way others did and there are other new forms of credit is discover getting the same share of those younger customers and are you keeping them do you feel theres anything to the thought that the millennials will be less likely to use credit cards and i mean if so are you looking at other products like buy now pay later discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so in terms of millennials based on the data we see were either the leading or one of the leading underwriters for college students and the brand is incredibly strong with college students and young adults that appreciate sort of the leading digital functionality as well as some of the innovations i talked about and were seeing very similar usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers so were very excited about the growth there and i think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator help to get our brand out there in front of the nextgeneration of consumers robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc great thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning congratulations to eric and craig as everybody else has said and thank you guys for taking the questions maybe follow on to bobs question but in a different way i mean you guys have tightened over the past several quarters you had substantial net pay downs im wondering has your kind of back book composition changed in a good or bad way or a positive or i guess negative way based on those patterns roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i would say nothing dramatic and part of the advantage we had we have been tightening for a number of years coming into this we felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call clearly we didnt expect it to end the way it did in early but that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes but i think some of our competitors did so we try and be consistent in how we run the business and so weve targeted the same prime consumer and i think ph israel has not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition either with the new accounts were booking or our existing portfolio john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks and the second question is private student lending i think you guys referred to some market share gains in the recent periods i know theres been some shifts in terms of other big banks that are exiting that segment and then theres a new administration and then maybe some changing policy or some thoughts about potential changing policy maybe just some commentary given your momentum there and your outlook there given those factors roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so i would say theres always a lot of discussion about what might happen in washington about student loans i would say keep in mind that over of student loans are the federal student loan program and so discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 thats where a lot of the attention is focused very different animal in terms of the quite frankly lack of underwriting of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market so we feel really good about the business we clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back but we believe we would have gained share even if they hadnt and so it reflects the fact that the brand is well positioned it resonates with consumers and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thank you guys very much operator our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia of bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi maybe just staying with some of your noncard products i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the outlook and competitive intensity you are seeing for some of the student loans personal loans even just on the network side of your business i know there has been a focus to grow some objective so maybe just talk a little bit about what youre expecting from those businesses as we head into thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so ill start on the payment side always very intense competition in the payment side we compete largely against two very large players so especially in debit its really headtohead competition for merchant routing day in day out we dont expect that to change but i feel good about the products we have and we have a great team on it in terms of other products we talked about student loans for personal loans we have modestly widened credit on that that was the product we tightened the most just given the volatility and the downturn weve loosened up i would say marginally and feel good about what were originating positioned a little differently than most weve always had a relatively narrow credit box for that and those loans are sort of bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily but i would say across all of our products given the returns we get these are all highly competitive very challenging markets and that sort of occurs day in day out mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and then just if i could quickly follow up on some of your nim comments i know you mentioned the funding side of the balance sheet optimizing that is there also an opportunity a little bit to optimize on the asset side of the balance sheet maybe you were running with a little bit of excess cash in given the downturn or is that fairly well optimized already thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks ill jump in on that one yeah we do have some excess liquidity right now and there is an opportunity to continue to move that forward now were going to ill say gauge that based on the level of asset discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity and weve built a plan that assumes a level of growth so thats one positive the other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in turning into cash and then in terms of balance sheet positioning we are mildly asset sensitive right now so in a rising rate environment that will also be beneficial to net interest margin so quite honestly the liquidity i think will take care of itself over time and the positioning of the balance sheet in terms of asset sensitivity very very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you operator our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning thanks for taking my question i just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about deposit growth specifically both the directtoconsumer and the broker deposits i guess for dtc its now i guess of total funding i believe previously you mentioned a longer term target of of the funding stack ph does that part still hold or do you expect dtc deposits to be even higher as a percentage of the funding stack going forward john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so were targeting so youre correct on the number so directtoconsumer our propositions been very very positive we dont compete on the basis of price which has been a good thing in terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have but also the fact that deposits continue to grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the discover brand in terms of the broker cds we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts right so as our funding needs increase well go more heavily into brokered cds as they decrease we shrink it so thats the way weve managed it traditionally its going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us but a what id say a less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great and then a second question just broad based is there i guess anything structurally different in regards to releasing reserves under cecl than in the prior method of looking at allowance reserves john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services not so much structurally i mean weve got a thorough process that considers all the elements of cecl under gaap the one thing i would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling and frankly a greater level of judgment given how far out into the horizon youre projecting losses so theres certainly a very strong discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 governance element theres a science to it and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well so yeah same could be said for incurred but the horizons much more difficult given timing of what were trying to project meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my questions operator and ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question our final question will come from the line of dominick gabriele of oppenheimer dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks so much for taking my questions can we just think about a potential windfall of excess capital from reserve releases if that was to happen and the economic situation persisted the way it is today and you felt comfortable releasing the reserves can you talk about the breakdown of how you would use that excess capital i mean when tax reform came then there was a flood of capital companies started talking about well do half or a third for growth a third for capital return a third for investment in technology something like that can you talk about how you think about those pieces should a flood of capital come your way thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah ill let john talk about capital return but i would say our business does not lend itself to rapid deployment of capital right we market on a consistent basis sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the amount of capital we have i dont think makes sense from a longterm standpoint the same holds true for technology right a lot of it is about spending smart not just putting huge amounts of money so i have a real hard if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release there may be some things at the margin in terms of investments in the business but by and large it will fall to the bottom line and ill let john pick it up there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and so dominick i do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases and a powerful economy our priorities actually remain the same so in terms of how we think about capital and allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases and then the last priority would be small ma i think bolton capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive longterm shareholder value so no change there we go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do and we share the outlook with our board and our priorities and obviously theres some regulatory constraints that we manage to as well and then well make good longterm decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 great that makes a lot of sense and then if we just think about the if you look at the nim in particular this quarter and the interest chargeoff reduction in the quarter that had a big impact on the yield and so could you just talk about the balance between lets say that interest and fee chargeoff even just reverting to normalized level not including the spike of loss i would say but has that sort of just normalized over versus some of the benefits you have on the interest expense savings that youre doing given all the what youre doing there maybe if you balance those two against each other could you still see kind of nim expansion or levels in versus stable to improving versus thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes dominick we do see opportunities for nim expansion even in the face of increased interest chargeoffs as the portfolio matures and contend with some of the economic stress but the numbers in terms of quantum im probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here but i will go back to what i said earlier in one of my questions in terms of how to think about it so we do see an opportunity for nim expansion and that some of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies but even contemplating that there will be a level of expansion dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc excellent thanks so much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services very good eric wasserstrom vice president head of investor relations discover financial services all right well thank you all very much for joining us anyone who has additional questions please give us a ring and i will be here to answer questions and have a great day john t greene chief financial
