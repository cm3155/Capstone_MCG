release john will then take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on last night weve reported second quarter net income of million or per share the quarter was characterized by strong asset and deposit growth while credit is performing right in line with our expectations importantly we advanced several operational priorities this quarter one key milestone occurred in may when we relaunched our cashback debit product were excited by the positive early results were seeing so far in the first few weeks we opened over new accounts and plan to begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall the relaunch advances our goal of becoming the leading direct bank and over time we expect cashback debit will be a significant entry point into the discover franchise we also continue to expand the discover global network this quarter we announced five new partnerships in the asia pacific region and added a new partnership with guavapay in the uk these strategic partnerships underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance and lastly we continue to invest in our discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 human capital were honored to have been recognized as the best places to work for people with disabilities this builds upon our recent recognitions as one of fortunes best companies to work for best workplaces for parents and best workplaces for women as you may have read in our press release last night beginning around mid2007 we incorrectly classified certain card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier we are taking actions to correct this card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and acquirers while the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material it underscored deficiencies in our corporate governance and risk management were in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters weve received a proposed consent order from the fdic in connection with consumer compliance which does not cover the misclassification topic we believe additional supervisory actions could occur i want to emphasize that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously weve made significant progress and investment in this area and look forward to working with our board and our regulators to achieve further advancements now ill hand it over to john to review our results and updated outlook in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone im going to open by addressing the financial implications of the card misclassification we have established a liability on our balance sheet of million to accrue for estimated compensation owed to merchants and acquirers in establishing the liability we adjusted retained earnings by million net of tax million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue the first half impact was million with that ill transition to our financial summary results on slide from this you can see that the financial performance of the business remains solid in the quarter we reported net income of million which was lower yearoveryear our results reflect strong revenue growth partially offset by a provision increase driven by receivable growth and higher expenses the trends for the quarter were robust loan growth a low efficiency ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology and strong capital and liquidity positions further details are reflected on slide net interest income was up million yearoveryear or our net interest margin ended the quarter at up basis points from the prior year and down basis points sequentially the benefits from higher prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances receivable growth was robust card increased yearoveryear reflecting a lower payment rate versus the prior year and modest sales growth the card payment rate remained stable quarteroverquarter and about basis points over levels sales volume grew in the quarter through midjuly growth continued to slow and was up about turning to our noncard products personal loans were up driven by strength in originations over the past year we continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting deposit growth in the quarter was solid with average consumer deposits up yearoveryear and sequentially our directtoconsumer balances grew billion and consumer deposits made up of our total funding mix we continue to target 70plus percent of funding from deposits discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was partially due to a million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a million gain this quarter adjusting for these our noninterest income was up primarily driven by loan fee income moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems these investments impacted several of our expense line items looking at our major expense categories compensation costs were up million or primarily due to increased head count marketing expense increased million or as we prudently invested for growth particularly in our deposits and personal loan products our commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the high moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter consistent with our expectation we are seeing credit normalization across all of our lending products looking ahead in card we continue to expect the seasoning of new account vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this year and into turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we increased our reserve by million driven by our doubledigit loan growth our reserve rate remained flat at our outlook on the macro economy has improved modestly we continue to monitor economic conditions well make adjustments to our expectations as needed looking at slide our capital position remains robust our common equity tier for the period was well ahead of regulatory requirements the cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to the card misclassification reduced our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter we repurchased million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of per share as roger indicated we are reviewing our compliance risk management and corporate governance and are in discussions with our regulators on these topics while this is ongoing we have decided to pause share repurchases concluding on slide with our outlook there has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the low to midteens we are updating our nim expectations to be around for the full year reflecting a combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs we are raising our guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits as previously indicated we are seeing upward pressure on expenses from the buildout of our compliance management systems and we are lowering our expected range of net chargeoffs to to based on our current delinquencies and roll rates to wrap up our business model continues to generate solid financial results and our capital funding and liquidity positions remain strong we continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable longterm performance enable us to achieve excellence in all parts of our business with that ill turn the call back to our operator todd to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions well take our first question from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning look id love to understand a little bit the link between what you identified in terms of the miscalculation and then how that precipitated the sort of inquiry into governance and consumer tracking roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services the fdic matter is not linked to the misclassification and so the misclassification is a separate issue the fdic matter is broadly around our compliance management system it doesnt mean that the misclassification may not result in further regulatory action but i dont want to speculate on that richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and is the expectation when weve seen these in the past that they result in things like memorandum of understanding and can do things like either constrained growth limit repurchases and capital actions how do you see this playing out and most importantly i think what everybody really wants to know is what is a reasonable timeframe to get some further clarity here roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i dont want to speculate on the timeframe of regulatory actions i would say to your point though they can take many forms and so were working through the draft with our regulators and well make more information available and the consent order will itself be public once thats completed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay i realize theres you have to be pretty circumspect about what you say here so thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks operator thank you well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah hi thanks this is jeff adelson on for betsy just i appreciate all the sensitivity around this and understand youre pausing the buyback i guess this is similar to what we saw last year in terms of regulatory discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 issue and getting ahead of the buyback freezing the buyback just wondering maybe if theres a way to speak to how these two issues kind of compared to the last years student loan servicing issue maybe in terms of scoping complexity roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah ill cover that piece and then maybe john can talk a bit about the buyback so i would say the consent order in student loan servicing was a compliance matter and so i think there is a link between that and the broader focus on our compliance management system with that maybe ill let john talk a bit about the buyback john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great and thanks roger and as it relates to the buyback we had robust conversations internally whether or not to pause the buyback and what management recommended to the board was that we paused the buyback as we work through the details of these compliance and risk management issues and are in conversations with our regulator i want to reiterate the following though our capital allocation priorities remain consistent so first invest in the business in growth and certainly through this year and into next year into compliance and risk management and second the priority will be to return excess capital to shareholders so no change in terms of the two primary capital allocation priorities i also want to focus your attention on to the strong capital generation that the business delivered in the quarter and has delivered historically so were hoping that we kind of work through these issues in an expedited fashion but timing i cant be specific on so would that the buyback will provide as much clarity on the timing of resumption when we have information on that jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you and just maybe shifting gears a bit here just wanted to see if we could get an update on what youre seeing in the consumer in your book today could you maybe also give us an update on the spend trajectory youve been seeing so far in july i know you talked about the growth rate slowing down to in recent months wondering if were seeing something similar from here roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so it has slowed down further so far in july so probably closer to not necessarily as bad as it sounds in terms of the health of the consumer because youve got some very challenging comps compared to last years growth as well as the very very high level of new accounts we put on last year and i think overall in terms of payment side delinquencies and losses as john said are sort of normalizing right on the path we thought they were and here i think the strength of the job market is very constructive for our sort of prime consumer base jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks for taking my questions discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 operator thank you well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc roger again i know that were probably eliminating what we could say here on the compliance side but i guess just a broader question can you maybe just help us understand what are the areas that you feel that the company has underinvested in and maybe just give us a framework for what you guys are doing internally to fix these i understand that john had talked about raising costs but can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what the investments youre making and what you think the time line is to get these done roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure john can maybe provide more color on the time line i would say its a multiyear but its also something that we have been investing in over the last couple of years so as you think about your compliance management system its everything from risk identification sort of process mapping building controls or change management processes the resources you have around risk management in the first line the resources you have in the second line in terms of the compliance function testing the internal audit your governance processes and so we are determined to be as strong on the compliance side and its excellent there as we are around customer experience data and analytics every other aspect of our business model so this is our top priority and the investment is both on the technology side outside consultants but also in terms of head count here at discover john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and then hey ryan on the trajectory and so i made this comment publicly about month and a half ago to we increased our spend in compliance and ill say tangential items to ensure compliance works as we wish it to work i indicated it was about an increase of million as we relooked at it we were going to accelerate that spend at probably million increase from and a million increase to now the implications for that on where we sit today we expect once we achieve that level in to be relatively consistent into and then as we kind of shape this piece of our business into something that we desire or regulators desire and our shareholders deserve we expect that expense burn to reduce discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate all that color and then maybe just on credit i think roger might have talked about the normalization of the front book as well as expectations for the back book to continue to normalized but you took the credit loss range down a bit so can you maybe just talk about one where youre seeing the improved performance and john as you look out maybe just talk about your confidence in the curve on losses bending as we approach sort of the midpoint of next year thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great so yeah the tightening of the range was reflective of a couple of things so first as time moves on we get more and more comfort with our forecasting on it and todate our forecasting has been right on top of actuals or actuals have been right on top of the forecast so that gave us comfort second is as time goes on we can move from the analytical model to a more kind of traditional roll rate model that gives us a greater level of comfort around the chargeoff and delinquency rates days out to days out so that gave us comfort to tighten that range and then on top of that certainly the jobs data and the forecast around employment gave us additional comfort in terms of what were seeing with the portfolio exactly what i said in the prepared comments so the newer vintages seasoning to expectation and older vintages basically normalizing to kind of levels in terms of the shape of curve what we expect chargeoffs to do in the back half of this year is the acceleration in terms of the rate of chargeoff to begin to slow and currently were expecting kind of chargeoffs to peak in the second half of it may push a little bit into but right now were seeing it in the second half of and then reach a level which likely will stabilize that for two to three quarters after ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for all the color operator thank you well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks for taking my questions first one is that weve talked about youve given us some sort of good trajectory of the normalization of the credit trends which i guess occurs later this year early into next year im wondering given kind of the comps and stabilization of inflation and so forth when do you expect to see normalization of loan growth and your guys opinions what is kind of the normalized level of loan growth john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so certainly real robust loan growth in the first half of this year and the last quarter of we expect the rate of increase to slow certainly in the third and fourth quarter and also against really really strong comps from and traditionally what this business has delivered is loan growth somewhere between two and four times gdp growth now we dont know what gdp is going to look like right now into but i would say this we did discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 cut the edges on the lower credit quality which will impact new account growth in card for the balance of this year were seeing as roger indicated and i mentioned in my comments sales growth to slow and probably stabilize in the single digits so that will also impact loan growth for the balance of this year and into next year so the stabilized number is a multiple of gdp typically unless theres some change to the macros that indicates its a good investment to either open up credit or appropriate to tighten credit john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats a helpful framework to think about and then with respect to the expense guide i think you talked about some investment in compliance and some investment in technology and so forth im wondering is there maybe talk about the competitive climate at this point relative to the past few years is there any spending required from a competitive perspective or do you have any can you characterize the overall competitive environment as well roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i think we continue to see good results from the money we put to work on the marketing front in terms of our cost per account obviously weve talked about the relaunch of cashback debit well put some money against that including the mass market campaign in the fall but have been excited with what were seeing in terms of the cost per funded account there so while the competitive environment is always intense across all of our businesses we feel good about how our value proposition is competing out there across all of our consumer products john hecht q analyst jefferies llc all right guys thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi john i was wondering if you could talk on the merchant miscalculation was that found internally or was that brought to you by a regulator or a thirdparty john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services it was found internally donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then on nim it sounded like the trajectory was pretty good in general and now its going to be around is there more promotional than you thought or more deposit competition can you talk a bit about that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah its a little bit of both actually so we ended at we said that we would be in our initial guidance up modestly and then in the first quarter call we said nim had likely peaked and then it would begin to move downward and what ill say normalize likely to a higher level than it has been historically so in the quarter the reason that we tweaked that guidance was we are investing in promotional balances so attracting new customers or building balances with existing customers now the returns on those offers are fantastic the impact on nim in the shortterm in the promotional period its minor but given our activity there it took a few points of net interest margin out and we thought that was an important impact to communicate second in terms of deposit competition we had said that we thought the beta would come in somewhere around to what weve seen in late in the first quarter and into this quarter was our competitive set being more aggressive in terms of price increases and as ive communicated in the past we dont seek to be a price leader here we try to compete on our brand our customer offering our digital assets that are first class in order to attract deposit customers and weve been very successful as you can tell by the numbers there but part of the proposition is also price so what were seeing now is beta is likely to be north of which is impacting net interest margin to the extent i just talked about in the guidance point so those two factors are playing most substantially on the revised outlook donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i have a followup on a couple of the points made on the consent order maybe the first one just on the share repurchase pause is that action taken in terms of prudence or out of an abundance of caution or do you think that there could be a material impact to your capital position and i guess secondly just on john you talked about the pressures on expenses into i guess like are there is there leverage on other expense lines to sort of moderate the overall implications for the year john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay so the decision on the share repurchase was out of prudence we have done a number of tests internally stressing a number of factors so that for example the ccar process we go through includes extreme stress we tested that off and ran some simulations and the output of that was that both capital and liquidity even in an extreme situation remain well above regulatory requirements so we feel comfortable about our capital and liquidity discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 the issue on the share repurchase was again out of prudence given what we have going on in the organization and we wanted to make sure that our actions are consistent with the right message in terms of being conservative and dealing with the first level of priority sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services in terms of expense leverage we continue to look at all of the lines and all of the investments we make in are expense based and the incident management situation were dealing with in terms of resources to get that under control thats a significant investment so resources supplement technology people and consultants certainly an investment on the indirect side we continue to leverage our procurement organization and ensure that first we concentrate on demand management and second on making sure theres a fair value exchange so thats the plan right now and will be the plan through the balance of this year sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay i guess a followup just for roger i know youve gotten this question in the past and im just thinking about the higher teasers and such i mean what makes you comfortable growing sort of midteens highteens above the really strong lapping of very strong growth a year ago i mean im just thinking about just the complexion of the accounts youre bringing in that makes you very comfortable here because its obviously having some implications on the nim roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah good question sanjay you have seen that growth start to slow a bit and i think it isnt necessarily that far out of line with what youre seeing from our other id say sophisticated primefocused competitors it is really strong demand for the product and as weve been clear we have been tightening not loosening credit and are watching the accounts we both very carefully and so were always ready to make adjustments whether its on the card product the personal loan or elsewhere but again we feel good and are closely monitoring the performance within the credit were making adjustments continuously both on the portfolio side and the new account side but these are very strong new accounts were bringing in and i think part of it is the differentiated value proposition that discover offers continues to resonate well with our target customer sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks operator thank you well take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to followup on the expenses in particular you said you continue to target efficiency ratio in the high could there be a time where you may have to make additional investments particularly around compliance that would have you go above the high efficiency ratio for a short period of time before returning back to it just given the nearterm impacts of both additional marketing spend on the debit account and the compliance issues thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services sure so as we sit here today we feel comfortable with what we shared in terms of lowdoubledigit expense growth this year weve taken a preliminary look at next year well share that at an appropriate time after we kind of review and get our plan approved by our board but im feeling like its very very achievable and thats why we enunciated that target or that goal but i would say this as we see opportunities to grow profitably and no contradiction to rogers point earlier about the demand for our products but well continue to take a look and invest for the medium term and longer term and were going to do that on the growth side were focused right now on the compliance side and well dial each of the expense levers in order to ensure we achieve the results that our shareholders want that our board expects and that the management team expects kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co are there any particular areas where you see the most opportunity to create efficiencies whether its marketing or head count or anything out there that you see that can allow you to continue to hit your goals john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so were investing in advanced analytics that were driving efficiencies in our rewards cost we continue to look at thirdparty spend and have achieved great results in terms of yearoveryear reduction in unit costs the situation this year is that weve invested heavily in resources people so were up were about up about people this year so when you bring on additional people both in collections and customer service as well as salary personnel theres other costs that go along with it so as we manage through this situation i continue to believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiencies by combining like activities taking a look at how resources are deployed organizational structures and over time optimizing that but right now with the situation were in weve decided that the first priority is get the right resources in to focus on the issues weve talked about and then were going to be able to drive efficiencies in the future kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you for taking my questions operator thank you well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 hi good morning thank you for taking my question i wanted to start maybe just on the business and the application quality of new applicants that youre seeing i think you mentioned in response to johns question tightening underwriting i guess firstly was that a new action you took in the second quarter and then just related to that tightening of underwriting and application quality i was wondering just if you i know youve talked in the past about actively monitoring the health of the consumer and the portfolio was there something youre seeing that is flashing red or caution thats making you tighter underwriting further here or just trying to understand the demand environment whos applying for a new loan currently whats driving some of the underwriting changes roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah good question so the tightening was not in the second quarter and was not in response to something were seeing and actually in terms of applicant quality whether its for home equity personal loans student loan or in card where were seeing very stable characteristics in terms of average fico in terms of the custom scores we use so it was series of changes we made i would say in prior quarters but a lot of stability in terms of the quality of applicant over the course of this quarter mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then maybe switching gears to the debit product that was relaunched can you talk just longer term strategically what is the i guess the thinking behind that product what is the goal is the idea there hey this is an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers and lower and how will that benefit you will it be through better nim because theyre offering rewards you ph may not necessarily need to offer as higher interest rate like just talk a little bit more strategically about why that product makes sense to invest in for discover and how you expect the growth trajectory of that product to go over the next few quarters here roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question so our aspiration is to be the leading digital bank and so when you think about a digital bank you think about the core dda or debit product and because we have a proprietary network we can offer rewards in debit in a way no other large bank can and it builds on our heritage around cash back and as the inventor of credit card rewards so its not just to crosssell to our card customers we think that this can pretty quickly become a significant entry point into the franchise for new customers and then over time much as weve done on the card side if you can provide a superior value proposition and customer experience they will want to buy other products from you whether thats a savings account and savings accounts where you also have the checking account then to have a lower beta or the card product so again a very important initiative for us i think over time will help continue transforming discover and were excited for the potential and youll see significant marketing against it this fall mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then just my last question just coming back to the compliance issue look i appreciate its difficult to provide too many details right now but maybe just on the timing give us some frame of reference like given that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 this is it sounds like the fdic consent order also is related to compliance issues you have the student loan issue now you have this issue does that entail a much longer review period or do you think this can go pretty quickly like a quarter or two to go through i mean again im not saying when you resume buybacks but at least like when you expect the review to be complete what are you trying to how quickly are you trying to complete the review internally and then i understand maybe the buyback discussion probably involves regulators and could be its a little bit harder to size but at least a review maybe you can tell us what your target is for like when youre trying to complete the review roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and to frame the compliance issue i would not over focus on the regulatory portion this is something where we as a team know we are not where we want to be and it is our top priority so it is aligned with the views of the regulators but our focus is taking many forms from simplifying our architecture automating manual processes streamlining and standardizing business processes bring on some great new talent as john talked about into the firm and we know that the result will not just be better compliance but a better customer experience a more efficient organization so the regulatory piece is important but i would say what most important is the commitment from me the team the board on achieving excellence in this area that will be a multiyear initiative but again i think critically important to the future of the company and one that we as a team are very excited about i would also separate that from the buyback but again it will be a journey on the compliance side but one that we are committed to mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you operator thank you well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs nicholas holowko q analyst ubs securities llc hi this is nick holowko on for erika thanks for taking my question just one more around the consent order and compliance issues as you think about the operational complexity of the businesses you operate in and as you go through your view looking into these issues do you feel like there may be an opportunity to take a closer look at some of the businesses you operate in whether that might be student loans or anywhere else thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah ill talk maybe more broadly about operational complexity and then john can talk about the businesses i think theres a great opportunity to simplify whether its we may have a similar process that is done frankly and again we have a much more i would say homogenous set of businesses than just about any other bank of our size so we think there are significant opportunities to simplify and again those wont just help from a compliance standpoint over time once the investments are made it will also help on the efficiency side discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and then regarding our businesses and products we think about this in line with our capital allocation priorities our connections to our customer base and what we can manage and manage well so we ph didnt start today historically weve looked at all our products our returns and as we look at those weve made decisions to invest in order to drive growth or achieve compliance excellence so were going to continue to look at that and if something is below our return targets then well fix it and invest or well look at other alternatives but certainly the focus today is to take our existing products make sure theyre a good offering that we can deliver those in a compliant way and drive a good return for our shareholders nicholas holowko q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for taking my question operator thank you well take our next question from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning just from a big picture perspective with the competitive environment the compliance environment roger as you look at your business what is your confidence that discover can deliver the types of returns that it has that investors have come used to over the last to years is there are you confident in delivering those returns with the higher compliance bar or the competitive set roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah id start by saying yes right this is an investment we need to make it is the top priority for the company but one that i think we will be able to do to fix and again over time well see benefits not just in compliance but in a better customer experience as well as more efficient if you step way back ive never been more excited about discovers business model and how it compares i think youre seeing the strength of our deposit franchise at a time when many banks are being tested we have the scale and resources to compete with anyone were making the investments to be at the leading edge around data and analytics our winning awards for our customer experience on not only just the card side but also our deposit products we have the relaunch of cashback debit so in terms of the business model and the returns we can give to our owners in my years at discover ive never been more excited to get to all of that though we need to get to where we need to be on the compliance standpoint and thats a critical part of operating a bank a financial services organization we are not where we need to be and we are going to get there robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you followup just on compliance having followed discover for a very long time coming out of the great financial crisis there was a lot big investment in compliance across the industry including at discover has it become more difficult i mean i know theres been a number quite a few consent orders put out by regulators discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 but has it become maybe give us some color on what youre investing in compliance today if its people or percentage of expenses versus historically and has it become a lot more difficult roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah it certainly is a challenging environment but im not going to blame that right as i look back i do believe we underinvested and thats something i take accountability for but we are very focused on it now and as john i think highlighted that investment takes many forms right from bringing in some highly talented folks within the compliance area building out our monitoring and controls investments on the technology side to standardize simplify automate manual processes as you think about it compliance and a lot of the focus its risk management right and traditionally we have been very strong around credit risk management around liquidity risk management but have not necessarily made the investments we needed especially as the complexity of our business increased as we got into more new products i think there was a gap there in terms of our capabilities and thats what were focused on now robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator thank you well take our next question from arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks on the net chargeoff peak that you highlighted for into second half of and possibly into is that an expectation that it would go north of kind of your normal underwriting chargeoff rate john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thanks arren no i mean we gave the chargeoff range now theres a numerator and denominator impact on that calculation of course but our underwriting is focused on prime revolver prime revolver behavior in our targeted segments looks very very consistent to where its been historically and our return expectations remain high and weve been able to deliver on that so in terms of is it going to be north and where it was historically we have seasoning of those new vintages but our credit box has been relatively consistent our analytics to kind of target customers and understand kind of risk factors i feel like has improved over the four years ive been here and certainly a longer journey than that so the trajectory to me looks very very comfortable in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high returns and generate capital arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thanks and then just to clarify on the expense commentary it sounds like youre not planning to pull back on marketing opportunities as your compliance costs are rising and then if you could just clarify the numbers that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 you gave earlier are those annual numbers i think you said like million up to million and then million and then down to million i was just a little confused on the trajectories there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services trajectory of the compliance management cost arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services was that your question arren or overall yeah so ill start with marketing and ill focus on the compliance second we havent made a decision to pull back on marketing we still see opportunity to generate positive returns from the customers that were targeting in that prime revolver segment and were also putting money towards helping people understand our deposit products and hopefully find that were compelling there we also have the campaign on the cashback debit program slated for the second half of the year so the marketing dollars how we thought about them at the beginning of the year remains consistent with where we are today and frankly i think it would have been shortsighted to pull back in order to manage to a particular number given the high returns were able to generate there in terms of the compliance cost what i was referencing was to where we are in and so about a month ago in a public forum i said that that increase from to was about million as weve looked at the work in front of us were dedicating an incremental probably million to million maybe as much as million over and above that here so it could be the delta from not million but maybe as much as million yearoveryear so to were up about million in total compliance and related costs does that provide clarity arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc yes yes i got it now thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great thank you operator thank you well take our next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great good morning everybody so when i look at your loan growth guidance you talk about low to mid teens and to me that means basically and so if you think about or that range that youre discussing it discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 would indicate the second half loan growth would be roughly and given the trajectory of loan growth in general it would end spending being at this quarter moving to in the most recent month it would suggest the fourth quarters loan growth would be probably lowsingledigits or something along those lines to make that guidance range and so i was just curious if thats the right math that you are thinking about or roughly if we could talk about that that would be great john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah i learned a long time ago not to give quarterly guidance because i found that i was not as accurate as i would have liked and other people would have liked so the range of kind of the doubledigit growth that we talked about you can take a look at the portfolio we made some comments on what was driving it so new accounts and certainly new account growth to has slowed sales while still very robust at an absolute level have slowed into july were doing targeted promotional activities to drive high generating high returning accounts and the comp in the fourth quarter of versus prior quarters is certainly a tougher comp so your math is certainly your math and i dont want to get into any more specifics than what i just did dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc no problem thanks a lot and then there are some signs that the national unemployment rate could start to move higher if you look at some of the state data if you saw seasoning and the unemployment rate rising at the same time could it have a more additive effect for ultimately higher net chargeoffs than otherwise the book without the seasoning effect and maybe just to relate to that your loan fee income has been quite robust in its growth and it beat our expectations by quite a lot this quarter is that kind of an indication of the seasoning effects that are going on with the late fees in that bucket john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks so much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah arren sic dominick the answer to both questions is yes so the loan fee income typically late fees and nsf fees and in terms of employment levels if unemployment was to increase that would certainly impact net chargeoffs but i would say this in the cohort of folks that we typically target what weve seen is if they are impacted by a job situation their time of recovery is pretty quick so by recovery i mean finding a new role so the fact that this cohort of prime revolvers isnt in the upper tier of income levels allows them to have a greater opportunity to find jobs of equal pay equal or more pay in the current environment so the employment early indications of employment or some challenges in some states we dont see any sign of that translating into a credit situation for us discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great im going to sneak one more in here is the discover spending growth has typically matched its loan growth trajectory over time given the stability of your business model if we dont see a normalization and meaningful fashion of payment rates is there any reason that the spending growth and loan growth trajectories would be uncorrelated as they have been in the past john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so well look at kind of opportunities to drive loan growth and part of that is the sales data the spending data from consumers and reflect that in our next set of guidance that we provide but specific in correlation in this form im not going to get into dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thanks so much appreciate it operator thank you well take our next question from bill ryan with seaport research partners bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc good morning thanks for working me in here at the end question on the personal loans business last quarter you talked about that there were some marginal tightening that you did but you had fairly robust loan growth this quarter could you talk about the market opportunity that youre seeing there and also the mix of new versus existing customers i believe the historical mix was about just curious if thats still the case roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so in terms of overall competition id say theres been a little bit of a pullback on the supply from side i would say markets and others as they pulled out but there are a good number of competitors a lot of them are much more broader spectrum than us in terms of how far down they go i think what youre seeing is really strong consumer demand as rates have gone up and our product is primarily used for debt consolidation people are looking to consolidate and pay down their credit cards and so were seeing very strong demand that is giving us the ability to tighten credit and even at the margin raise our prices and still see strong demand so its a product where underwriting and credit is everything the mix is largely new but a good amount are crosssold to our existing cardholder base so its customers where we also have experience with that bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thank you eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 so i think we are going to
