challenging environment with considerable uncertainty as our country continues to struggle to stop the spread of covid19 and the impact on our economy remains very significant of course the safety of our employees continues to be a top priority all areas of the firm including our us based customer service team are operating effectively in a remote environment and we have informed employees they

customers with our skipa pay programs since we launched this program in midmarch we have helped over customers across all of our products and in fact about of total loans enrolled have already exited the program the skipapay program was intended to be a short term option and we plan to end program enrollments in august after that well continue to offer assistance to those who qualify on a customerbycustomer basis now to our results for the quarter we generated a net loss of million or per share the most significant driver of this was a billion reserve build in recognition of further deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook subsequent to march the credit performance in our portfolio has been stable and we believe that the actions weve taken over the past few years including reducing our contingent liability and the additional credit actions we implemented in march position us well nevertheless the reserve build reflects our view that persistent longterm unemployment will increasingly impact prime consumer lending portfolios the pandemic continued to have a significant impact on sales volume as well as loan growth through the quarter we saw sales down and lower card loans while down yearoveryear both compared favorably versus other issuers principally due to our greater concentration in everyday and online spend categories as opposed to te operating expenses of billion were flat to the prior year and included a million onetime impairment charge to our diners business related to the impacts of the slowdown in global te spending excluding this operating expenses were down yearoveryear we remain on track to deliver the million of expense reductions we previously announced even as we continue to invest in core capabilities including analytics and discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 data science we expect these investments to strengthen our ability to achieve profitable growth and shareholder value through improved targeting and personalization better underwriting decisions and enhanced collection strategies just to name a few of the benefits were also responding to shifts in consumer preferences with our investments in contactless and secure remote commerce since the end of we have seen a increase in contactless spending im pleased to say we are on track to have most of our top merchants enabled for contactless in and to have contactless cards issued to the majority of our card members by the end of the year consumers have also shifted to much more online spending which makes our investments in secure remote commerce and our partnership with the other major networks to implement clicktopay even more significant our disciplined approach to capital management and liquidity remains a top priority for us particularly in the current environment we have continued to see very strong demand for our consumer deposit products even as we have been reducing rates consumer deposits are now nearly of total funding and we have reduced our online savings rate basis points since early march discover has a very strong financial foundation loyal customers and a proven business model im confident that we have taken the correct actions to strengthen the discover franchise and we are well prepared to continue to drive long term value to our shareholders and customers ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone taking a look at the quarter were pleased with our response to the rapidly shifting economic environment including taking appropriate actions to manage expense capital credit and liquidity our capital position combined with advances in analytics and credit risk management put us in great shape to return to profitable growth when conditions are right today ill recap the financial results for the quarter and provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions similar to last quarter i wont review our standard slides on loan growth payment volumes or revenue and expense but you can find our traditional disclosures on slides to in the appendix to this presentation on slide looking at key elements of the income statement revenue net of interest expense decreased in the second quarter primarily driven by lower net interest income due to nim compression and lower net discount and interchange revenue reflecting decreased sales volume net interest margin was for the quarter down basis points from the prior year this was driven by three factors average loans were flat yearoveryear reflecting the lower sales volume loan yields declined as the average prime rate was basis points lower on a yearoveryear basis due to fed rate cuts in and basis points cut in march this year these were partially offset by lower funding costs we moved aggressively to reduce our deposit rates gross discount and interchange revenue decreased driven by the decline in sales volume this was partially offset by a decrease in rewards cost other income was up due to a million gain on the sale of an equity investment discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 the provision for credit losses was billion and included net chargeoffs of million which were up from last year and a billion increase in reserves primarily due to further deterioration in the economic outlook ill provide additional comments on credit with the next slide operating expenses were flat to the prior year but down excluding a onetime item marketing and business development expense was lower yearoveryear as we responded to the significant slowdown in the us economy the majority of the expense reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition cost as we aligned marketing spend with the impacts of the economic environment and tightened credit criteria offsetting this in our diners club international business we booked a million noncash intangible asset impairment charge as a result of the slowdown in crossborder travel and entertainment spending apart from the onetime impairment charge we anticipate realizing million of expense reductions from our previous guidance range we made good progress on the expense front in the second quarter and well continue this momentum through the balance of the year as the economic environment evolves well continue to monitor and take actions on expenses as conditions warrant turning now to slide showing credit metrics credit performance remained stable in the quarter card charge offs increased basis points from the prior year mainly due to seasoning of loan growth the credit card 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from last year and down basis points from the prior quarter the lower delinquency rate reflects the overall stability of the card portfolio with a very modest impact from the skipapay program our private student loan portfolio reported strong credit metrics in the quarter with net chargeoffs nearly flat to the prior year the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from the prior year and basis points lower than the prior quarter credit performance in this product continues to benefit from tight underwriting and a high percentage of cosigned loans personal loan net chargeoffs decreased basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was basis points lower than the prior year and down basis points from the prior quarter these credit metrics benefited from disciplined underwriting and our strong customer service and collection efforts while the overall portfolio performance has been stable through the second quarter we do expect to see some deterioration in consumer credit in coming quarters moving to slide which shows our allowance for credit losses in the quarter we added billion to the allowance primarily due to further deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook as we considered the level of allowances needed we modeled several different scenarios this scenario to which we gave the greatest weight included a sharp increase in peak unemployment to a rate of recovering to at the end of followed by a slow recovery over the next few years we assumed an annualized real gdp decline of quarterover quarter or down on a yearoveryear basis the quarterly reserve calculation also included an overlay which considers the impact of the skipapay program leveraging our previous experience with disaster relief we also considered unemployment reports in june and july which showed higher permanent unemployment and the impact of recent increases in covid19 cases turning to slide which details sales trends by category through midjuly total card sales volume decreased in the second quarter the greatest weekly decline was in midapril when total sales were down for the discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 week ending april since then weve seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened sales were down just through the first half of july since then we have seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened we have continued to see positive trends in retail which were up in the second quarter and in the first half of july within the retail category home improvement has been exceptionally strong up in the quarter on high consumer demand we also benefited from adding home depot to our rewards category strong online spending growth also contributed to solid retail sales in the quarter travel restaurants and gas continue to be the most negatively impacted categories slide highlights enrollment trends in our skipapay program which offers relief to customers experiencing financial stress due to the pandemic we saw the peak in the cards program during the first week of april at million firsttime enrollments have steadily decreased since then in the week of july enrollments decreased to just million to date we enrolled a total of billion of card loans however the majority of customers needed only one month of assistance and as of july over of card loans were no longer enrolled of those out of the program approximately have returned to making payments moving to slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially mainly due to decline in loan balances in march we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at the time and it remains suspended to date weve continued to fund our quarterly dividend at per share of common stock in line with requirements provided by our regulators and approved by our board of directors our preliminary stress capital buffer was set at with the final scb expected towards the end of the third quarter we will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer any other regulatory limitations and board approval our liquidity portfolio remains strong with billion in liquid assets it has increased over billion from march since the onset of the pandemic we have been a leader in reducing rates on our consumer deposit products nevertheless weve continued to see strong demand with average consumer deposits increasing yearover year and now making up of total funding well continue to look for opportunities to reduce deposit costs to summarize the quarter were pleased with our results given the extremely challenging environment we took swift action on expenses and are continuing to invest in core capabilities so were prepared for the recovery when it comes outside of a onetime item operating expenses were down as we started to benefit from our expense reduction programs credit performance remained stable but some deterioration is expected in the coming quarters we took a conservative reserving approach and added billion to the allowance for credit losses and finally capital and liquidity both remain strong while we remain conservative given the continued level of economic uncertainty we feel good about the actions weve taken todate and the strength of the discover franchise before we open up the call for qa i wanted to announce that after a career in consumer finance including many years at discover craig streem has informed us of his desire to retire i am sure most if not all of you have interacted with craig over that time and enjoyed a great relationship with him he has been an important partner to roger our leadership team and for me hes been a wonderful team member and a terrific help with my discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 transition into the company craig is going to continue to lead the ir team until a successor has been named and is in place so you will have plenty of opportunity to wish him well as we all do that concludes our formal remarks so ill turn the call back to our operator to open up the lines for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions we will take our first question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning im glad you guys are doing well and congratulations craig i guess my question is on the reserve build im curious if you feel like with this reserve build that youre pretty much done provided theres no significant change to the macro outlook and then i know john you mentioned the forbearance or the skipa pay has positively impacted delinquencies by a modest demand but maybe you could just talk about what will drive the impact that youre expecting in the next few quarters in credit quality thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services hey sanjay its roger ill cover the first part and then pass it to john so in the reserve we i think took a conservative approach and used an economic outlook that was considerably worse than the end of  under cecl as you know right that is reserved for the life of loan for the loans we have on our balance sheet and so further reserve increases would mean that we had further deterioration in the economic environment or would be based on the growth of the balance sheet as we look ahead and ill pass to john for the second one john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so yes so sanjay just to echo those comments we feel very good about the overall reserve and the conservative approach we took especially given when you look at the portfolio performance that weve seen to date and actions weve taken back as far as on the personal loans business so overall we feel very comfortable with our reserve today and as the economic conditions unfold that will have an impact either plus or minus on the overall reserve the forbearance programs have acted exactly as we had hoped theyve helped some customers manage through the pandemic and as i said in my prepared remarks most the high majority of the people who entered the card program have exited and are repaying so very very mild impact to delinquency reporting as well sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im just curious is there a specific number in terms of the amount of benefit from the forbearance impact john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yeah so its actually relatively small and the delinquency number is somewhere between and basis points sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning craig its been a long time congratulations and i hope you have some great plans craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services thanks bob robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc weve been talking a long time craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services yeah thank you robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc roger so youve been with discover a long time youve seen a lot of recessions and changes i just wondered i was hoping you could give some thoughts on what you feel are going to be permanent changes to the industry and maybe just i mean if you could get john some if you could give us some color on how much of your spend today is online and what it was prior to the pandemic roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so i was going to say in my 20plus years at discover ive seen a lot of things but ive never seen anything like this in terms of the speed and magnitude of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy i dont think any of us in business have seen this nevertheless i feel like we were very very well positioned for this going in and i think over the longterm what youve seen is really an acceleration of some trends that were already there so the migration out of branch to digital channels which again has always been part of our business model consumers shifting from physical to digital purchases and there i think our advantage of having our proprietary network and the work were doing with other major networks on src will be helpful for physical purchases the shift to contactless so those are really some trends that have been there but have accelerated in a very significant way as a result of the covid pandemic discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc okay john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services and bob in terms of the sales trends we havent broken it out between brickandmortar and online but what i can point you to is retail in my prepared comments in terms of the growth weve seen there a lions share of that has been as a result of online retailers and you know the major players there which is driving ill say a further demise of the brickandmortar retailers and accelerating the digital channel for card things that discover offers in terms of the network and our secure remote commerce that were working on all will position us well for that growing trend robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kind of a short term question if you could talk a little bit about the nim outlook in the near term and then roger longer term coming out of the credit crisis if i recall you guys came out and took share and were positioned pretty well i know were in the midst of this but how are you thinking about the other side of this the consumer is going to have a fair amount of savings and do you look at these types of opportunities as market share gain or is that too premature to be thinking about that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay so why dont i start with the nim question so in the first quarter our nim was and then in the second quarter it came down to im not going to give a bunch of detail here but what i can say is we look at the second quarter as likely the trough on nim overall what weve been able to do is execute pretty well in terms of deposit pricing and our funding stack has been such that more expensive funding sources are fading away and were getting a benefit there so since the pandemic just to give you some details we decreased our online savings by about basis points thats an immediate benefit to net interest margin in the company and then through the balance of the year were going to continue to look for opportunities so some of that will be based on the funding of our balance sheet and some of it will be based on the competitive environment that were dealing with roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and in terms of gaining share i think its never too early to think about that it feels like were gaining share in the card business in terms of loans and sales this quarter from what i have seen from competitors reporting and thats within the significantly tightened credit box that we have one of the capabilities weve been working on is just the ability to react more quickly and that helped us react very quickly to the pandemic in terms of tightening discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 credit across all our products but that should also help when job losses abate and it becomes time to widen the credit box as well so we feel good about our capabilities and our ability to gain share across all of our products donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i guess i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the performance that youve seen with respect to borrowers that are exiting forbearance and the fact that youre assuming kind of unemployment at year end so as we think about the likelihood of either needing more or less reserving like how do you think about the information that were going to get over the next several months in terms of how we think about reserving levels as we go forward john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services moshe thanks for the question so and its a great question and honestly its a bit of art and science so what we have seen in terms of customers exiting is about of those customers are making payments and close to of those are making full payments so were feeling very good about the customers coming out of the programs now to be honest those segments inherently are likely to be a little bit more risky so we continue to watch the differentiation on customers who elected to enter into one of the skipapay programs to see if theres any potential issue but as you step back from it the overall size of the portfolio versus the customers who have elected to go into skipapay program is relatively small right moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so were looking at the impact as very very mild the delinquency trends have been from my standpoint very very encouraging and i think thats a function of some of the government stimulus function of our collections operations and the value of our credit card overall versus other payment forms or other payment forms as well as what it means in terms of ability to operate in the digital economy so we like the fact that our portfolio has a high concentration of credit cards and we also think that well come near the top on the payment prioritization through even a tough tough downturn operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc craig im going to miss you craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services likewise betsy thank you appreciate that thanks betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so back to work the question i have is just around the reserving level i know you already addressed one question on that earlier in the qa but ive been getting some investor questions regarding how to think about the reserves that youre building today versus the loss experience you had during the great financial crisis now granted its very different environment but the unemployment rate is relatively high and a little bit higher than what we had during the gfc so i thought id take the opportunity to ask you how you would answer that question how should i think about what the right reserving level is for todays book versus the losses that you had during the crisis thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so let me start by talking a bit about the unemployment rate and then ill pass it to john to talk on the reserves i think the unemployment rate were seeing now is very different and weve talked a bit about temporary unemployment as well as the impact on sort of entrylevel retail entrylevel hospitality entrylevel restaurant and so you cant map total unemployment to losses in a prime card base the way that you saw that pattern in last downturn and so things like permanent unemployment you need to adjust to that and so were not just looking at the raw unemployment numbers as we do our modeling ill pass it to john to talk a bit about the reserve john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and then betsy just one other piece and its a relatively important difference here when you go back in time on the great recession versus where we are today so the overall the industry the quality of the originations is much better today than it was at the great recession or prior to that in general higher ficos across every single form of lending product delinquency levels coming into the recession this recession versus the great recession are lower consumer financial obligation load is significantly lower today than it was coming into the great recession and debt service load was also lower today so the consumer is stronger coming into this recession than coming into the great recession the traditional links between unemployment and delinquency and chargeoffs were trying to model that its really hard to nail that down right now given all the government stimulus but overall as i look at where we are discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 today and based on our underwriting and where our card card loan comes into payment priorities i feel like were very very well positioned versus where the company was coming into the great recession and then we also talked about inactive lines weve taken inactive lines down nearly pick the number close to billion so were prepared for the worst but i feel like were in a better position betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and youve got this really high savings rate going on right now i mean do you use that in your analysis as a kind of bridge to a lower unemployment rate as youre thinking about reserving john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah we didnt actually quantify that but as we were making determinations on economic scenarios and frankly the overall quantum of reserves and reserve coverage it was a point that helped us get to where we arrived betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks could you give us a little more color about what we should expect from delinquency and chargeoff formation in the coming quarters and how if at all those expectations and your reserve levels are impacted by your expectations for benefits from different forms of government stimulus and different forms of lender forbearance across your customers different financial obligations john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay so a tricky question so ill start with how were expecting delinquencies and chargeoffs to roll in so as i said earlier the books held up really really well delinquency levels have come down we do think some of that is as a result of stimulus we also feel like our teams are doing a great job in terms of interacting with our customer base to help the customers get through tough times those that are experiencing some trouble the trajectory of chargeoffs based on what were seeing right now looks like we would expect elevated charge offs starting more in the fourth quarter and then coming into thats frankly its tough to call right now because were modeling out unprecedented scenarios here but i think a good way to think about it is chargeoffs elevating in perhaps peaking in the later part of depending on the economic scenario that were dealing with and then starting to tail off in in terms of delinquency delinquency will we think will start to tick up in the fourth quarter perhaps as early as the third quarter but were not seeing any indicators yet and then continue into in terms of the government programs we did nothing in our modeling to reflect whats been kicked around right now in washington in terms of the next round of stimulus so that i think that could certainly push out the curve a little bit in terms of both delinquency and chargeoffs discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes i mean i think as you think about the importance of the government programs its less about the check that a family gets as you think about life of loan losses and what that will support its really the impact of those on the overall economy and keeping the trough from being too deep so to johns point we really think about it just in terms of at a macro level as opposed to what those checks may do in one month for a given household mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of meng jiao with deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning guys a quick question i guess on the average balance sheet i saw the average cash and securities were up materially this quarter just trying to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about the securities portfolio and whether or not you ph avoid extend duration to pick up some yield given the nim at a trough in thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so weve been pleased with how actually how the balance sheet has come together certainly the asset side has been strong as we talked about in the prepared comments on the liability side weve seen great appetite on our for our deposit products which is positive we have also been able to avoid wholesale funding were not looking to substantially change any of the duration of any of the liabilities that we see on the balance sheet were effectively at a interest rate basically a balanced interest rate risk position so were feeling good about that craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services cristal operator okay your last question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good morning so weve seen a lot of controversy around the dividend on with several competitors or even some other banks and i was just wondering how much how you think about the dividend going forward and how much of a priority is to maintain it given some shareholders look at it as important or just maybe how you think about it given the trajectory of your earnings roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yes so i would guide you to sort of looking back over the last years where youve seen a very clear strategy from discover given the high returns we generate from our business an important part of how we manage capital is returning it to shareholders in the form of a dividend and weve had historically a measured increase to those dividends as well as buying back stock and were very disciplined and to a lesser extent involved in ma so thats what we like to do i would say until the environment improves its quite safe to expect continued heavy regulatory focus on return of capital and so we will have to adjust our strategies accordingly certainly if they keep going with the four quarters rule thats something that again it will depend going forward but thats something that weve looked at but i think were going to watch and work with our regulators on this but managements intent is unchanged and so well have to see how it goes kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then regarding your comments on the chargeoff rate peaking into late i mean i think we would have expected a little bit more of a big bulge coming out of the deferral periods and the expiring of a lot of the stimulus could you just talk about how the what the cycle is going to look like or how you envision it playing out with chargeoffs playing out in the early and then what it looks like in the back half john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so were seeing that the portfolio continues to be really really stable as i said the payment programs we saw obviously the disclosed level of entries into the programs and then a surprisingly high number from our perspective exiting after one payment which to me was a good sign as they exited the payment percentage or payment rate of those customers has held up very very strong so were comfortable with that so if you just look at where we are as of june and then just do a kind of straight ph rule model it out its hard to see any massive increases in chargeoffs for the balance of the year even if things deteriorate from the consumer standpoint so that means what were likely to see is chargeoffs grow through the year slowly and then i wouldnt call it a bulge but a higher level of overall chargeoffs in the middle to second half of now thats what thats how were seeing it today i certainly would caveat that and say that consumer behavior is really difficult to predict here in a time such as this sorry i cant be kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you very much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah sorry i cant be more specific on that kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co yeah its a very uncertain time i understand thank you operator i will now turn the floor back over to craig streem for any additional closing remarks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript
