operations and improves cost efficiencies seasonality in our credit card business we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns around the winter holidays summer vacations and backtoschool periods in our private student loan business our loan disbursements peak at the beginning of a schools academic semester or quarter although there is a seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the levels of credit card and private student loan receivables seasonal trends have not caused significant fluctuations in our results of operations or credit quality metrics between quarterly and annual periods revenues in our diners club business are generally higher in the first half of the year as a result of diners clubs tiered pricing system where licensees qualify for lower royalty rate tiers as cumulative volume grows during the course of the year competition we compete with other consumer financial services providers including nontraditional providers such as financial technology firms and payment networks on the basis of a number of factors including brand reputation customer service product and service offerings incentives pricing and other terms our credit card business also competes on the basis of reward programs and merchant acceptance we compete for accounts and utilization with cards issued by other financial institutions including american express bank of america jpmorgan chase capital one and citi and to a lesser extent businesses that issue their own private label cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers in comparison to our largest credit card competitors our strengths include cash rewards conservative portfolio management and strong customer service competition based on rewards and other card features and benefits continues to be strong our private student loan product competes for customers with sallie mae and citizens bank as well as other lenders that offer private student loans our personal loan product competes for customers primarily with financial institutions including citi and american express and nontraditional lenders including lending club our home loan product faces competition primarily from traditional national and regional mortgage lenders although our private student and personal loan receivables have increased our credit card receivables continue to represent a majority of our receivables the credit card business is highly competitive some of our competitors offer a wider variety of financial products than we do which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors enjoy greater financial resources diversification and scale than we do and are therefore able to invest more in initiatives and technology to attract and retain customers such as advertising targeted marketing account acquisitions and pricing offerings in interest rates annual fees reward programs and lowpriced balance transfer programs in addition some of our competitors have assets such as branch locations and cobrand relationships that may help them compete more effectively another competitive factor in the credit card business is the increasing use of debit cards as an alternative to credit cards for purchases because most domesticallyissued credit cards other than those issued on the american express network are issued on the visa and mastercard networks most other card issuers benefit from the dominant market share of visa and mastercard the former exclusionary rules of visa and mastercard limited our ability to attract merchants and credit and debit card issuers contributing to discover not being as widely accepted in the united states as visa and mastercard merchant acceptance of the discover card has increased in the past several years both in the number of merchants enabled for acceptance and the number of merchants actively accepting discover we continue to make investments in expanding discover and diners club acceptance in key international markets where an acceptance gap exists in our payment services business we compete with other networks for volume and to attract network partners to issue credit debit and prepaid cards on the discover pulse and diners club networks we generally compete on the basis of customization of services and various pricing strategies including incentives and rebates we also compete on the basis of issuer fees fees paid to networks including switch fees merchant acceptance network functionality customer perception of service quality brand image reputation and market share the diners club and discover networks primary competitors are visa mastercard and american express pulses network competitors include visas interlink mastercards maestro and first datas star american express is a particularly strong competitor to diners club as both cards target international business travelers as the payments industry continues to evolve we are also facing increasing competition from financial technology firms and alternative payment solutions which leverage new technologies and a customers existing deposit and credit card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other feebased solutions in our directtoconsumer deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other large banks including ally american express barclays capital one goldman sachs synchrony and usaa we compete with banks and credit unions that source deposits through branch locations and direct channels we seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings on the basis of brand reputation digital experience customer service and value for more information regarding the nature of and the risks we face in connection with the competitive environment for our products and services see risk factors strategic business risk intellectual property we use a variety of methods such as trademarks patents copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property we also place appropriate restrictions on

of our business activities due to both internal and external factors which we segment into seven major risk categories the first six are defined to be broadly consistent with guidance published by the federal reserve and the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs credit consumer and counterparty market liquidity operational compliance and legal risk we recognize the seventh strategic risk as a separate risk category we evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on our company by assessing the financial impact the impact to our reputation the legal and regulatory impact and the clientcustomer impact in addition we have established various policies to help govern these risks credit risk our credit risk arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation our credit risk includes consumer credit risk and counterparty credit risk consumer credit risk is primarily incurred by discover bank through the issuance of i unsecured credit including credit cards private student loans and personal loans and ii secured credit including deposit secured credit cards and home loans counterparty credit risk is incurred through a number of businessfacing activities including payment network settlement certain marketing and incentive programs assetliability management guarantor and insurance relationships and strategic investments market risk market risk is the risk to our financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates credit spreads or equity prices given the nature of our business activities we are exposed to various types of market risk in particular interest rate risk foreign exchange risk and other risks that arise through the management of our investment portfolio interest rate risk is more significant relative to other market risk exposures and results from potential mismatches in the repricing term of assets and liabilities yield curve risk and volatility in reference rates used to reprice floatingrate structures basis risk foreign exchange risk is primarily incurred through exposure to currency movements across a variety of business activities and is derived specifically from the timing differences between transaction authorizations and settlement liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or an inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions operational risk operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events operational risk is inherent in all our businesses operational risk categories incorporate all of the operational loss eventtype categories set forth by the bcbs which include the following i internal fraud ii external fraud iii employment practices and workplace safety iv clients products and business practices v damage to physical assets vi business disruption and system failures and vii execution delivery and process management compliance risk compliance risk is the operational risk of legal or regulatory sanctions financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws regulations rules other regulatory requirements or codes of conduct and other standards of selfregulatory organizations applicable to us compliance risk exposures are actively and primarily managed by our business units in conjunction with our compliance department our compliance program governs the management of compliance risk and includes oversight by our risk committee and compliance committee legal risk legal risk arises from the potential that unenforceable contracts lawsuits or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect our operations or condition these risks are inherent in all of our businesses legal risk exposures are primarily managed by our business units in conjunction with our legal organization our risk committee and compliance committee oversee our legal risk management specifically the legal organization is responsible for providing advice interpreting and identifying developments regarding laws regulations regulatory guidance and litigation and setting standards for communicating relevant changes to corporate compliance the business and internal audit the legal organization also identifies and communicates legal risk associated with new products and business practices strategic risk strategic risk is the risk that our strategies and the execution of those strategies do not produce the desired outcome resulting in a negative impact on our enterprise value this risk can be driven by internal and external factors including i our business model market position selection of strategies and execution of those strategies and ii competitor strategies emergence of new competitors emergence of new technologies changing consumer preferences or other market factors our risk committee actively manages strategic risk through the development implementation and oversight of our business strategies including the development of budgets and business plans our business units take on and are accountable for managing strategic risk in pursuit of their objectives enterprise risk management framework our enterprise risk management principles are executed through a risk management framework that is based upon industry standards for managing risk and controls while the detailed activities vary by risk type there are common process elements that apply across risk types we seek to apply these elements consistently in the interest of effective and efficient risk management this framework seeks to link risk processes and infrastructure with the appropriate risk oversight to create a risk management structure that raises risk awareness reduces impact of potential risk events improves business decisionmaking and increases operational efficiency risk identification we seek to identify potential exposures that could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement strategies and achieve objectives to ensure that the full scale and scope of risk exposures from firmwide activities are identified we seek to identify risk exposures based on i significant enterpriselevel risks that are strategic systemic or emerging in nature including companyspecific risks that span across multiple lines of business ii granular risk exposures from onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet positions including concentrations and iii risk exposures from initiatives focused on new expanded customized or modified products services and processes risk exposures identified through these three approaches are consolidated to create a comprehensive risk inventory this inventory is leveraged by a number of processes within our company including stress scenario design and stress testing capital planning risk appetite setting and risk modeling the risk inventory is reviewed and approved at least annually by the risk committee while the subcommittees review the risks mapped to the relevant risk categories for transparency and comprehensive coverage of risk exposures risk measurement our risk measurement process seeks to ensure that the identified risk exposures are appropriately assessed risk measurement techniques appropriate to the risk category including econometric modeling statistical analysis peer benchmarking and qualitative assessments are employed to measure our material risk exposures risk monitoring our risks are monitored through an integrated monitoring framework consisting of risk appetite metrics and key risk indicators kris these metrics are established to monitor changes in our risk exposures and external environment risk appetite metrics are used to monitor the overall risk profile of our company by setting risk boundaries and expectations through quantitative limits and qualitative expressions we use kris to monitor our risk profile through direct or indirect alignment with the risk appetite limits these metrics enable monitoring of risk by business management and by measuring risk and performance data against risk appetite and kri escalation thresholds that are updated periodically escalation procedures are in place to notify the appropriate governance committees in the event of any actual risk limit breaches or potential upcoming breaches risk management we have policies and a defined governance structure in place to manage risks in the event of a risk exposure exceeding established thresholds management determines appropriate response actions responses which may be taken by the board of directors the risk oversight committee the audit committee the risk committee subcommittees or the cro or business units may include i actions to directly mitigate or resolve risk ii actions to terminate any activities resulting in an undesired or unintended risk position or iii actions to prevent avoid modify share or accept a risk position or activity prior to its occurrence risk reporting as the constituents primarily responsible for proactively managing the risks to which they are exposed our business units and risk and control functions periodically report to the governance committees the crm function is responsible for independent reporting on risk matters to various constituencies across our company on a periodic basis the crm department periodically provides risk management reporting to the risk committee the audit committee the risk oversight committee and the board of directors stress testing we use stress testing to better understand the range of potential risks and their impacts to which our company is exposed a stress testing framework is employed to provide a comprehensive integrated and forwardlooking assessment of material risks and vulnerabilities stress test results provide information for business strategy risk appetite setting and decisions related to capital actions contingency capital plans liquidity buffer contingency funding plans and balance sheet positioning our stress testing framework utilizes a risk inventory which covers our risk exposures across our defined risk categories the risk inventory provides a comprehensive view of our vulnerabilities capturing significant risks from the board of directors and managements view granular risks relevant to business units and emerging risks associated with new initiatives risk management review of compensation we believe in a payforperformance philosophy which considers performance across our company business segments and individual performance as appropriate as well as the longterm interests of our shareholders and the safety and soundness of our company we design compensation to be competitive relative to our peers to attract retain and motivate our employees in addition to being competitive in the markets in which we compete for talent and encouraging employees to achieve objectives set out by our management our compensation programs are designed to balance an appropriate mix of compensation components to align the interests of employees with the longterm interests of shareholders and the safety and soundness of our company the design and administration of our compensation programs provide incentives that seek to appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not incentivize employees to take imprudent risks is compatible with effective controls and enterprisewide risk management and is supported by strong corporate governance including oversight by our board of directors and the compensation and leadership development committee of our board of directors risk appetite and strategic limit structure risk appetite is defined as the aggregate level and the type of risks we are willing to accept or avoid in order to achieve our strategic objectives risk appetite expressions are consistent with our companys aspirations mission statement and core values and also serve as tools to preclude business activities that could have a negative impact on our reputation risk appetite is expressed through both quantitative limits and qualitative expressions to recognize a range of possible outcomes and to help set boundaries for proactive management of risks risk appetite measures take into account the risk profile of the businesses the external macroeconomic environment and stakeholder views including those of shareholders regulators ratings agencies and customers these limits and expressions are revised at least annually or as warranted by changes in business strategy risk profile and external environment management and our crm department monitor approved limits and escalation triggers to ensure that the business is operating within the approved risk appetite risk limits are monitored and reported on to various risk subcommittees the risk committee and our board of directors as appropriate through ongoing monitoring of risk exposures management seeks to be able to identify appropriate risk response and mitigation strategies in order to react dynamically to changing conditions capital planning risk exposures identified through the risk identification process across risk categories and risk types are consolidated to create a comprehensive risk inventory

undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to

permitted under delaware law regardless of the usury limitations imposed by the state laws of the borrowers residence delaware law does not limit the amount of interest that may be charged on loans of

act removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio leaving the fdic free to set a cap in the future the fdic also previously amended its deposit insurance regulations in ways that have raised discover banks cost of deposit insurance further increases may occur in the future acquisitions and investments since we are a bank holding company and discover bank is an insured depository institution we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make in addition certain permitted acquisitions and investments that we seek
