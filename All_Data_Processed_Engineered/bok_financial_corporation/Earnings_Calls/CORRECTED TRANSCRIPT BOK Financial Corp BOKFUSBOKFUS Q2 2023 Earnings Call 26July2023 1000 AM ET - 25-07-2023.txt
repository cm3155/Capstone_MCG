kymes stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials second quarter financial results starting on slide second quarter net income was million or per diluted share im proud of the exceptional second quarter financial results delivered across the board by our team wealth segment revenues set another record this quarter and core loans reached an alltime high led by the commercial and multifamily segments our growth efforts are supported by the vitality of our geographic footprint as well as our diverse business model bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 noninterest revenues were almost of total revenues for the quarter using our capital and liquidity strength we are taking advantage of market and economic uncertainty to prudently grow our full service banking market expansion into san antonio and the addition of a fixed income sales and training office in memphis are just two more examples of how we are investing to build longterm shareholder value that disciplined long view approach has consistently been a distinct advantage for bok financial turning to slide periodend core loan balances increased million or linked quarter with growth spread across ci and commercial real estate the deposit trajectory flattened and turned positive during the quarter our loantodeposit ratio remained below at the end of the quarter across the industry deposit costs have accelerated for all banks including us as reported in our results as marty will detail later our reported net interest margin is diluted by the increased trading activity this quarter and our margin excluding the trading activities indiscernible were seeing early signs of loan spreads increasing as banks seek to contract and also work through the impact of higher deposit costs and anticipated higher capital requirements for some this impact will take many quarters to become meaningfully apparent our efficiency ratio came in just below even with the shift in mix of non interest revenue credit quality remained very strong as we continue to grow our allowance and have a combined reserve of which is notably above the median of our peer group assets under management or administration grew billion or linked quarter and were up billion or compared to last year the market impact on cash equities and fixed income combined with the growth in new relationships is providing a tailwind we did not have for this area in finally we repurchased  this quarter as we balance opportunities for growth with attractive repurchase valuations ill provide additional perspective on results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans were billion or up linked quarter total ci loans increased million or linked quarter with yearoveryear growth of million or commercial real estate loans increased million or linked quarter and have increased million or year overyear this effectively returns those balances to their level after experiencing significant paydown activity in compared to december cre balances have grown at a modest annualized growth rate growth this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily residential properties with an increase of million or linked quarter industrial facility loans grew million or linked quarter which was offset with a million or linked quarter decline in loans secured by office facilities the yearoveryear cre growth of million was primarily driven from loans secured by multifamily residential properties and industrial facilities we have an internal limit of of tier capital and reserves to total cre commitments and were presently at the upper limit of that range we do expect continued growth in outstanding cre balances as construction loans fund up as of june cre balances represented of total outstanding loan balances a ratio well below our peers healthcare balances increased million or linked quarter and have grown million or year overyear primarily driven by our senior housing sector healthcare sector loans represented of total loans at quarterend energy balances increased million or linked quarter and have increased million or yearoveryear with periodend balances representing of total periodend loans combined services and general business loans our core ci loans increased million or linked quarter with yearoveryear growth of million or these combined categories represent of our total loan portfolio yearover bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 year loans have grown billion or excluding ppp loans  extends the linked quarter loan growth to seven consecutive quarters our pipeline suggest we have the current momentum to drive continued growth in the loan portfolio throughout near our current pace turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio well below historical norms and prepandemic levels nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies increased million this quarter nonaccruing loans increased million driven by an increase in energy related nonaccruals while repossessed assets fell million the level of uncertainty in the economic outlook of our reasonable and supportable forecast remained high and the assumptions for commercial real estate vacancy rates increase during the forecast period those economic factors combined with second quarter loan growth supported a million credit loss provision for the quarter we remain in a solid credit position today with the ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate substantially less than our peers and history of outperformance during the past credit cycles we believe we are wellpositioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead the markets are more focused on the office segment of real estate given the recent trends and workforce preferences so it remains an open question as to whether this will be sustained as employers continue to require more time in the physical office our maturities are generally ratable over the next three to four years and we have a miniperm option if the markets are not conducive to longterm permanent financing the average loantovalue ratio in the office space is below and average cash flow coverage exceeds times based on the most recent semiannual review at the end of net chargeoffs were million or basis points for the second quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months far below our historic loss range of to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to continue to be low the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend the total combined allowance is available for losses and any applestoapples industry comparison should include the combined reserves we expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upward as we expect loan growth to continue and the economic uncertainty to persist ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the second quarter up million or linked quarter our wealth segment set a new quarterly high for fees and commissions at million this quarter with the last four consecutive quarters representing four of the five highest quarters on record trading fees and customer hedging revenues were the primary drivers of the linked quarter increase up million and million respectively fiduciary and asset management fees increased million largely due to seasonal tax service fees the trading fee increase was primarily driven by million improvement in our mbs trading activities trading activity and margins improved coming off exceptionally low volume and high volatility in the first quarter the desk has been able to increase volume by expanding coverage to downstream accounts as mortgage originations slowly increase and market volatility returns to more normal levels the million customer hedging revenue increase was driven by a record quarter for energy customer hedging fees with linked quarter fees up million fees from other institutional trading activities increased million linked quarter fiduciary and asset management fees were million for the second quarter a linked quarter increase bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 our assets under management or administration were billion an increase of billion or linked quarter growth was spread across most categories and primarily driven by improved asset values our asset mix for assets under management or administration moved slightly this quarter with fixed income equities cash and alternatives we believe our diversified mix of fee income is a strategic differentiator for us when compared to our peers especially during times of economic uncertainty we consistently rank in the top decile for fee income as a percentage of total net interest revenue and noninterest fee income our revenue mix has averaged just over during the last months that consistently supports a revenue stream that is sustainable through a wide array of economic cycles ill now turn the call over to marty martin e grunst executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp thank you scott turning to slide second quarter net interest revenue was million a million decrease linked quarter net interest margin was a basis point decrease versus  it is important to note that basis points of the basis point margin decline was due to growth in trading assets our trading business grew revenue and grew profitability as you can see in the fee income trends but was dilutive to net interest margin as trading assets grew at narrower spreads relative to the rest of the balance sheet when trading assets are higher or the yield curve is flatter or inverted which we experienced this quarter the dilutive impact to net interest margin is more significant net of the basis point impact from trading the remaining basis point decline was driven by the competitive deposit environment as average interest bearing deposit costs increased basis points the cumulative net interest bearing deposit beta increased to and dda continued to shift into interest bearing although at a reduced pace dda was of total deposits at june this slide shows net interest margin and net interest revenue with and without the impact of the trading business to better highlight trends and comparability for the second quarter of the net interest margin excluding the impact of trading assets was at versus in the first quarter growth in earning assets during the quarter was driven by loans and trading assets as the securities portfolio remained stable to maintain our balanced interest rate risk position turning to slide liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers total deposits grew million on a periodend basis and the loantodeposit ratio was unchanged from the prior quarter early in the second quarter we saw a continued downward trend driven by april tax payments and some price sensitive movements though at a slower pace in the prior two quarters balanced trends rebounded in early may and we grew billion in deposits in the back half of the quarter this was consistent with our expectations and we are happy with the results in such a competitive environment our tangible common equity ratio was down basis points linked quarter due to balance sheet growth and increases in interest rates but up basis points from yearend adjusted tce including the impact of unrealized losses on held to maturity securities is cet1 is and if adjusted for aoci would be as regulatory capital changes are being proposed for the industry we believe that across the array of plausible outcomes for banks in our size range we have ample capital to support additional organic growth while at the same time allowing for continued share buyback during the second quarter we repurchased  at an average price of per share turning to slide linked quarter total expenses increased by million or personnel expense grew million with million due to the full quarter effect of annual merit increases implemented on march while cash based incentive compensation grew million due to new business production these were partially offset by a million seasonal decrease in payroll taxes other operating expense grew million primarily due to a bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 million increase in mortgage banking costs driven by a seasonal increase in prepayments and a million increase due to the donation of an appreciated asset to the bokf foundation yearoveryear total operating expense increased however this includes the impact of market value driven swings in deferred compensation and changes in the vesting assumptions for stock related compensation excluding those two factors total operating expense increased compared to  with a increase in total personnel expense due to regular compensation and increased cash based compensation related to new business production other operating expense increased primarily due to continued investments in technology facilities and increased fdic expense turning to slide ill cover our expectations for we expect upper singledigit annualized loan growth economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain favorable and continue to be supported by business in migration from other markets changes in the competitive environment for loans should be a tailwind we expect to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat in to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position we expect total deposits to be stable or grow modestly and the loantodeposit ratio to remain in the low currently we are assuming one additional basis point increase here in july before the federal reserve pauses we believe that the margin will migrate lower throughout as interest bearing deposit betas increase and demand deposit balance attrition runs its course net interest income is expected to be near billion for2023 in aggregate we expect total fees and commissions revenue to approach million for we expect expenses to be near or slightly above  levels and the efficiency ratio to migrate slightly above throughout the remainder of as our revenue mix shifts and our strategic market expansions ramp up this does not include the impact of the fdic special assessment which could be finalized in the second half of our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality we expect quarterly provision expense similar to that in recent quarters changes in the economic outlook will impact our provision expense we expect to continue opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks marty as we have again demonstrated this quarter strong risk management and strong financial results are not mutually exclusive we expect to do both well our talented teams collaborate well to ensure we grow our company the right way a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles while the market is more focused on capital and liquidity i see this as a unique opportunity to use our strength in these areas to both organically grow and invest in new markets while others may be more internally focused i continue to assert that we are in a stage where investing in strong banks versus trading the sector matters banks with top of growth and diverse business mix meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform that certainly continues to play out for us in we are focused on using that fantastic geographic footprint to grow both in the current environment and in the years to come with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting with credit with the expectation that provision could go higher based on growth in the economic outlook you call out the expectation for vacancy changes maybe can you spend a little time on where you think i guess specifically office vacancy is and could go and how your markets are holding up with that return to work and in your outlook on office and i guess should we assume that office continues to decline and that provide some opportunity to fund new cre loans that are not in office marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah jared this is marc the office portfolio that we have weve been reducing our office exposure over the last several years so this is not new and we would expect to continue it to continue to decline if we look at our footprint our overall markets we think are in great shape i mean youre looking at markets that have performed very well in multiple economic downturns when were looking at the economic outlook were looking at its impact on the overall economy as opposed specifically to our portfolio and we would expect that we can maintain this level of performance on the cre portfolio going forward as ph our focus has been on multifamily and industrial which have held up very well stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah if youre looking at the forward guidance and trying to intimate maybe that there could be higher provision expenses thats not how we see it i think that we think that we reflected future potential outlook in cre and how we formulated our allowance methodology so that the forwardlooking aspect of potential higher levels of office vacancies is really how we supported the allowance this quarter were not trying to foreshadow that provision levels could be higher in future periods in fact our guidance was kind of near current levels depending on the economic outlook certainly should the economic outlook improve and provision levels could even come down from here so its really just a function of how we see the economy playing out in future periods jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 okay thats great color thanks i guess shifting to deposits and funding you highlighted that there was strong trends in deposits in the second half of the quarter how sustainable squaring that with the broader view of lower growth on deposits for the year should we assume that that growth helps you remix deposits or how should we think about deposit mix going through the rest of the year with that growth outlook martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah i think that deposit growth should remain on an upward trend here with some noise within there i think on the mix side dda is probably the more interesting question and we really saw the dda mix shift slowed down appreciably in may and june in fact june average and june ending dda balances were about the same so that trend actually turn reasonably favorable in the back half of the quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and do you think that that could that weve sort of found the bottom here on dda then martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah we i dont know if id call it precisely the bottom its certainly those trends are very favorable you could have just a little bit more given another fed hike here you can have a little bit more but those trends looked very good in the last two months jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess finally for me when we look at the buyback and your comments about opportunistic buyback is that really more opportunistic based on price or is that opportunistic based on alternative uses of capital at any given sort of point in the quarter martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah those are the two factors i mean were just trying to maximize shareholder value with how we do that and price is a factor and to the extent that our outlook is for strong organic growth opportunities to be present of couple of quarters going to make sure that weve got sufficient wherewithal to support that and thats obviously first in the pecking order but thats kind of how we do the calculus stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp jared before the kind of first quarter in the industry the most common question was what are you going to do with all your excess capital so were obviously think that longterm we probably do have a little bit of excess capital to deploy share buybacks are part of that but were being a little bit careful maybe in this environment at least for the nearterm jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 okay thanks and i guess maybe just circling back on the deposits in terms of your expectation for beta how should we be thinking about cumulative data going through with the potential or the expectation for one more hike martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah we do think that cumulative beta does keep moving up here we were at this quarter and our assumption thats within our guide is that across the and gets up into the territory by the end of the year stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i would agree with marty but i think the cumulative beta over the life of the cycle is going to be kind of where we said it was going to be all along somewhere in that to range jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks very much operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe a question for you marty when i do the math on the margin it seems like theres a little bit of pressure coming but maybe not that material can you confirm that just how much pressure do you think is ahead in the net interest margin and what do you think the cadence might look like for the next couple of quarters assuming the feds done today martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah thats right and that is our base assumption and maybe the best way to walk through that is to talk through net interest revenue kind of what the pluses and minuses are from here because like june net interest revenue for the month of june was million and so if you kind of start from that run rate loan growth is going to be a plus obviously bond portfolio repricing is going to be a plus in  we saw million of principal cash flows runoff at about a million runoff yield and were reinvesting that around million for the second quarter and youll see that trend you know continue through future quarters bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 and even within the fixed rate part of loan portfolio that was small youve got the same dynamic going on there that provides a lift and well continue to provide lift the deposit betas were at cumulative right now that will continue to bleed up here as you get another rate hike and then you just get a little bit of residual carry forward and the july rate hike that doesnt really independently move the needle that much and then as youre talking about before the dda mix shift thats really slowed down a fair amount so that impact gets a lot smaller so if you look at those pieces the dda and the deposit reprice are declining effects that are getting close to depending running their course here and then the loan growth is a growing effect over time and the bond portfolio reprice thats a declining effect over time but it lasts a while so but that kind of gives you a little bit of a color around how that plays out over the next couple of quarters stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and generally were focusing on net interest revenue versus net interest margin because the trading side of the trading portfolio will greatly influence that margin and so its easier for us to think about it in terms of net interest revenue because if the activity is strong and the trading portfolio expands obviously the net interest margin impact that is very dilutive and so it could it influenced by that but thats going to benefit us on the b side should that trading portfolio continue to perform as it has been jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay that makes sense i do want to ask got a question on that but just one comment you made was you grew billion in deposits later in the quarter what was the driver of that and was it higher rate deposits or was it more client driven or help us understand what that was martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah so thats mostly commercial and wealth driven to a lesser extent consumer but largely our what we talked about last quarter just making sure that weve got price competitive offerings throughout the footprint that compete with the alternatives that our customer base have in those segments and so were just yeah making sure that our price points are at market at all price points and thats what drove it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp indiscernible on the fee side and the consumer book as well on top of that okay okay then scott last one for you you talked about volumes and volatility helping your brokerage and trading you talked about extending the reach of the salesforce can you talk about that a little bit more and about the better environment what makes for more favorable environment so we can kind of understand how the balance sheet might flex when theres a better environment or worse environment scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 right absolutely so in the first quarter when we saw a lot of kind of external shocks to the fixed income market we had a very the fed was in the midst of very active rate hikes we saw bidask spreads really widen out in the first quarter and we saw dwindling to very very historically low mortgage origination so as weve moved into the second quarter as we mentioned weve seen a pickup as the reality of plus mortgage rate settles into the market for home buyers albeit still a shortage of inventory were seeing rate kind of expectations settle in which has increased mortgage origination weve seen the moves whether the announcement today is one more or two more rate hikes were clearly further into the fed rate hike cycle which creates a better appetite of our institutional buyers of mortgagebacked securities and all fixed income products to position their portfolios so weve seen kind of the combination of better outlook and certainty in the fixed income markets coupled with little bit better flow on the mortgage backed security side so those factors have given us better confidence in kind of resuming our previous levels of securities inventory levels stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and if you think about it from an investment portfolio management position if you know youre toward the end of the hiking cycle whether its today or today plus one more you begin to get more confident in repositioning your portfolio because you dont think well im just this is going to keep happening and so im not indiscernible just going to keep trading into that that could optimistically help us out in the second half of the year if the market participants believe the fed is done or near done jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay clearly first quarter was abnormal but is this maybe an impossible question does this feel more normal stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp it does and i think that as marty indicated our levels of trading securities our balances there appear to be more business as usual so we look for these levels to be sustainable given the current rate environment and the appetite for repositioning on the curve jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right guys thank you martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp sometimes we tell you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 jon sometimes we tell you dont use the end of quarter trading level as you know the way to think about the future this quarter its probably better than the average jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay very helpful guys thank you operator our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well i understand the dynamics of having a net interest margin that moves a little lower in the back half of this year but im wondering as we look to next year the fed will be done deposit costs will probably have peaked could you see an expanding net interest margin into next year just because your asset reprice is higher and the nim could be actually headed higher next year martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah so thats part one i would again focus on net interest revenues the way to think about next year and if you can play out the comments that i made earlier you can see that the growth trend and the percentage sure is possible to see that higher especially if you get less of an inverted curve thats going to help as well stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp youve got a couple of factors there i think martys reinvestment rate where were getting what roughly million a quarter and cash flow from the securities portfolio thats reinvesting at to basis points higher than what were receiving today thats going to help you a little bit the trepidation in answering the question is really just understanding how deposit behavior is going to be as we grind higher for longer if were through the worst of that from an industry perspective then i think youre right theres upward opportunity on the margin if deposit pricing continues to grind higher in a more meaningful way then then that could be the offset to some of the favorable benefits that we see bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then intra quarter you guys had a couple of announcements expanding into san antonio also expanding into memphis maybe just the rationale behind those new markets and is this something we should expect to see going forward putting new markets on the map organically stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i think its theyre probably a little bit two different stories san antonio is a market that indiscernible for a long time we have a strong presence in dallas fort worth and houston central texas has been a gap for us and weve just been looking for kind of the right way to enter that market were excited about the team weve acquired there and well have corporate commercial treasury wealth both in san antonio and austin well have a complement of between and folks there in central texas that will be an opportunity for us to meaningfully expand our presence there and so thats going to be full service banking in the beginning of another key market for us in texas i mean memphis really was an opportunistic chance for us to grow our fixed income sales and trading platform that wasnt necessarily on the radar screen as we began the year but as things unfolded and opportunities presented themselves we really saw it as additive to the current operations we have in little rock milwaukee and stamford connecticut it fits very cleanly you have very little sales overlap with our existing portfolio and were excited for the team that is going to come on board there to help us in that area brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and just lastly for me the price of oil is still very strong but the price of nat gas is depressed and we have seen a little bit of noise in that space but maybe just talk about how you think i know nat gas i think its only about a third of your energy but do you expect to see some issues in nat gas over time stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp not at this point we have like right now of our gas heavy borrowers are hedged and have over of their pdp in and of their pdp hedged at prices in exceeding so were theyre wellpositioned to receive price well above what were seeing in the spot market plus todays market you can hedge out all the way into at almost an mcf so we continue to push hedging as a way to protect their portfolio as well as improve our credit risk and our customers have been responding so we actually are in a really strong position that we expect our natural gas producers to perform well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please proceed with your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 hey good morning thanks for taking my questions stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brandon martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc good morning yeah so i wanted to touch on the outlook as far as loan growth in the prior quarter you detailed that economic conditions were very strong and in this quarter now its kind of been downgraded to favorable so just want to know if you could provide more context and details around that what youre seeing in your markets and with your customers stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i guess maybe we didnt communicate well but we certainly dont see unfavorable economic conditions for loan growth i mean our footprint markets in the south southwest midwest are performing exceptionally well i mean theres no signs of kind of economic slowdown or early signs of any economic issues in fact the longterm and shortterm that footprint of texas and colorado and arizona clearly are high growth markets infill from in migration from other markets i think is going to really benefit them longterm so were very bullish and in fact weve signaled in our guidance upper singledigit loan growth for the year and were very confident that well be able to achieve that objective i think our yearoveryear growth is about and were in a range to continue that pace so were we still see good pipelines we still see good opportunities and frankly the opportunity we have in front of us is a little bit unique in that others are trying to manage capital ratios or other things like that so theyre maybe less aggressive in the marketplace and so from a sales perspective were endeavoring to be very active in front of customers and prospects to try to add to our customer and loan deposit and asset under management but we want to grow all those areas at a time where weve got lots of capital and great liquidity and were in business and were not having to kind of meter that growth well take all that we can get in this environment marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah the only thing i will add is the key here is that this has been a very broadbased growth i mean we have had all our lines of business experiencing growth not just concentrated in one particular sector or another our cre we are kind of at our upper end of our range of our concentration but the construction loans have continued to fund up so were seeing it in ci were seeing healthcare energy and cre all experienced growth so we expect that reflects a lot of things that stacy was talking about martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 yeah and brandon if you look through to the state level gdp the state level of employment for our footprint that still remains very strong theres no downturn there at all brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and within that and the tailwind from the competitive environment with these opportunities that youre getting are you able to get kind of higher loan spreads or better economics on some of these deals youre getting today stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp theres no doubt i alluded to that in my prepared comments that we are seeing particularly on the higher end of the corporate space deals are pricing upward whether its from fewer participants in the market or those beginning to price for higher capital requirements on the higher end of the banking segment we are seeing that to basis point increase in loan spreads i think that will take some time to work through the portfolio effect but clearly thats an opportunity as we move forward brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then just lastly from me is there any way you can provide kind of the spot cost of deposits at the end of the quarter martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah theres not really weighted to do that in particular new production if you look at our cd rates that were offering weve got rates in the upper and as new production for that varies by market but thats probably what weve got for you brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp thanks operator our next question comes from matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning just a few followups here from some previous questions on the customer hedging activity obviously good quarter in it sounds like this is mostly from energy customers would love to appreciate if you think theres some good fall through their potential for the back half of the year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i think the hedging activity there i mean it was a record really in the second quarter but its been strong for us both on the energy side and the interest rate derivative side both experienced really strong second quarters i think that the shape of the yield curve is going to help on the interest rate derivative side i mean its odd that you can go out and hedge out ph three years at a cheaper rate than the spot rate but that is the case today and so thats helping a little bit on the interest rate derivative side and as we talked about with natural gas future prices and frankly oil prices the markets in a good place to hedge and swap future prices and do it in a way thats conducive to our customers so whether its the same level as the second quarters its hard to forecast that in a highly volatile segment but i think that there is good momentum to be able to still have that be a very strong segment for us matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay appreciate that stacy and then in the press release there was a mention of the million gain from merchant services just remind me what line item this flows through martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah that flows through the other gains and losses kind of right below the fee income matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay i see it perfect and then on the trading securities marty i heard your comment that the end of period balance could be a better starting point for than the average i guess from a balance sheet standpoint on the other side of the balance sheet remind me of how thats typically funded martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah so we can use either fhlb or repo either one whatever is cheaper and so its just the shortterm wholesale matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then i guess along with that fhlb and the repo line other borrowing lines if youre going to see some pretty strong loan growth it sounds like this quarter should we see the fhlb and borrowing line comes down is it a replacement or do you think theyll still be an increase there given the trade securities build that you expect martin e grunst a executive vice president chief financial officer bok financial corp yeah so well have good loan growth well have deposit growth that will fund a decent portion of that and then of whatever the net is from pluses or minuses in the trading portfolio that will really drive the changes in fhlb or repo bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah but matt it really goes back to kind of reeducating the investor community and kind of how we fund the bank loans fund are funded by deposits you saw a good loan growth this quarter you saw good deposit growth this quarter our loan to deposit ratio stayed relatively consistent and we see that as we move forward on the security side whether its the available for sale investment security or the trading portfolio those are largely going to be funded wholesale whether thats repo or institutional or otherwise and thats entirely consistent with how we funded the bank forever precovid youre seeing higher levels of fhlb borrowings and things like that because thats we got down to none during covid so as things kind of revert to the mean how we fund the bank is going to look like it did precovid and that it includes how we think about loans and deposits and how we think about institutional funding or wholesale funding for our securities portfolio and trading activities matt olney q analyst stephens inc yup okay thats helpful stacy and then just lastly i guess i think you mentioned earlier on the call that the afs securities yields could continue to climb as you get some reinvest some of those cash flows any more color on just kind of the rolloff rollon yields within the afs book stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah so we think about both afs and held to maturity roll together because both have the same driver and so the rolloff yield is always going to be roughly what the portfolio yield is i think that was million if im right for this quarter and then current coupon year mbs or maybe a little bit less than that is kind of a good proxy for how to think about our repurchase yield on average over time and so that gives you well over pretty good spread basis point plus spread pick up matt olney q analyst stephens inc yup okay okay thanks guys appreciate your help operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to marty
