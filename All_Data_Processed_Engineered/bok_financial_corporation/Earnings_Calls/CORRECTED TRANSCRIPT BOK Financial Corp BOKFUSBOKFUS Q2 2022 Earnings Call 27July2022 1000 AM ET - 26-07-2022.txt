president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials second quarter financial results starting on slide second quarter net income was million or per diluted share the quarter represented strong earnings performance from across the company demonstrating both our diversity and breadth core average loan balances grew million during the quarter with growth spread among geography and loan types more impactful to this quarters results was the basis point increase in our average loan yields our loan portfolio has begun to reprice in response to the recent increases in shortterm rates as weve noted previously our balance sheet is assetsensitive with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans repricing in a year or less brokerage and trading revenues increased led by institutional trading fees and a new quarterly high in energy hedging and the second best quarter historically from commercial loan syndication fees fiduciary and asset management fees grew million as our waivers and our money market funds declined as shortterm rates increased transaction card and deposit service charges both grew linked quarter million and million respectively our periodend core loan balances grew million or linked quarter but even more impressive with our growth in unfunded loan commitments those grew million or linked quarter the overall credit quality of our loan book continues to be outstanding with additional improvement again this quarter turning to slide ci loan balances increased linked quarter with an increase in ci commitments of average deposits decreased billion this quarter with virtually all of that in interestbearing balances these declines were consistent with our expectations given the actions of the federal reserve to increase short term rates compared to june periodend balances are still billion or higher than last year with a favorable mix shift to noninterestbearing balances assets under management or in custody in our wealth management group fell slightly this quarter down to billion the change was market valuedriven primarily due to equities which account for a third of the assets under management or administration ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were up were billion up linked quarter midway through the year core loans have now grown billion or annualized total ci loans grew million or linked quarter with growth spread across our footprint our texas and oklahoma markets produce combined core ci growth of linked quarter across the markets healthcare energy and services were the primary sectors driving this quarters solid ci result although commercial real estate growth was quiet this quarter linked quarter commitments grew so we expect that to translate into balance sheet growth over the next several quarters bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 loans in the energy space continued their recent linked quarter growth trend periodend balances grew million and have increased million since december linked quarter outstanding balances grew while unfunded commitments increased linked quarter creating more opportunity for balanced growth as we look to the quarters ahead healthcare balances increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by our senior housing sector excluding energy and healthcare core middle market ci realized positive growth again this quarter with linked quarter growth of million or ci utilization rates did increase slightly this quarter but have yet to return to precovid levels we still have significant capacity to increase outstanding loan balances as demand continues to come back online without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition a return to more normal utilization levels organically adds million of core ci loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty areas based on the growth in balances and commitments over the last two quarters combined with the geographic and loantype diversity we are very confident in our ability to produce continued growth throughout the remainder of this year commercial real estate periodend balance growth slowed this quarter following the strong first quarter performance through june balances have increased million an annualized rate of commitments grew million or linked quarter with yeartodate commitments up million we have plenty of capital allocated for this space to grow balances this year and given the low current utilization level a return to more normal funding levels could add several hundred million dollars in outstanding loan balances within the next two to four quarters we entered the year with a focus on growing top line revenue and the second quarter demonstrates the progress we are making on the lending front we are confident that the momentum weve experienced up to this point will continue and the resulting loan growth for will be one of the best in our recent history turning to slide you can see that we continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio overall credit quality is the best weve seen in quite some time far better than pre pandemic levels excluding loans guaranteed by us government agencies nonperforming assets fell million this quarter to million excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies nonaccrual loans are now million as a percentage of tangible equity and loan loss reserves our criticized assets are at levels not seen in the last years our sustained trend of improving credit quality metrics was enough to offset any need for a credit loss provision this quarter which would have resulted from the strong loan growth and changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts primarily related to the economic outlook from the federal reserves actions to control inflation given our solid credit position today a ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate thats substantially less than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles we believe we are wellpositioned should another economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead we realized net recoveries of during the second quarter excluding ppp loans net chargeoffs have dropped to an average of basis points over the past four trailing quarters which is far below our historic loss range of basis points to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to continue to be low bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 excluding ppp loans the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend we expect this ratio to migrate downward though continued strong loan growth will increasingly influence the prospect of resuming a provision in future quarters ill now turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the second quarter a million increase from the first quarter institutional trading fees increased million linked quarter as we moved past last quarters volatility returning us to more sustainable trading levels and revenues driven by increased activity from our energy customers our commodity and hedging activities had a record quarter with fees of million a million increase from the record set last quarter commercial syndication fees recorded their second best quarter ever with fees of million an increase of million linked quarter fiduciary and asset management fees increased million linked quarter primarily due to seasonal tax preparation fees and growth in mutual fund fees and revenues largely driven by increases in shortterm interest rates our assets under management or administration fell linked quarter to billion this is primarily driven by a decline in the equity portion of the portfolio with equities representing about a third of the total assets despite the decline related to current market valuations our strong sales activity in this space provided an offset to that change with total assets under management or administration relatively flat to this time last year our current mix of assets under management is fixed income equities cash and alternatives our relationshipcentric business model is perfectly in touch with clients needs today as we continue to navigate through this market volatility we believe the confidence and appreciation for financial advice weve earned from institutions and individuals positions us well to serve our clients in this period of market uncertainty transaction card revenue increased million or linked quarter as transaction volumes improved yeartodate card revenues are up compared to this is largely due to broader reopening of the us economy driving transaction volume as well as some impact from inflation deposit service charges increased million this quarter with growth once again equally split between our commercial and consumer segments compared to second quarter last year total service charges have grown million or yeartodate approximately of the deposit service charge fees were consumerrelated overdraft fees we expect to make changes in the fourth quarter of this year that will reduce consumer overdraft fees by approximately million per quarter mortgage banking revenue decreased million or linked quarter with production revenues down million due to lower production volumes combined with narrowing margins mortgaging servicing fees increased this quarter and are higher than the second quarter last year during the last months weve strategically acquired servicing for approximately billion of unpaid principal balances mortgage production volume decreased million during the quarter to million as the industry continues to face housing inventory constraints and rising mortgage rates the rise in mortgage rates has significantly impacted the refinance market resulting in only of mortgage loans funded for sale this quarter down from in the first quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 ill now turn the call over to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks scott turning to slide second quarter net interest revenue was million a million increase from last quarter interest and fees on loans increased million linked quarter largely due to a 35basispoint increase in loan yields average loan balances increased million loan yields increased as our variable loan rates began to reprice in response to the recent increase in shortterm interest rates our balance sheet is asset sensitive with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans repricing in a year or less interest on our trading securities fell million as we reduced the average trading securities billion linked quarter while interest income on trading securities fell this quarter this was more than offset with an increase in institutional trading fees recognized in fees and commissions interest income on the availableforsale and investment portfolios increased million linked quarter primarily due to a 7basispoint increase in the average yield on the availableforsale portfolio due to higher reinvestment rates during the second quarter we moved billion in securities from availableforsale to heldforinvestment this is the primary driver million linked quarter increase in the investment portfolio and the million decrease in the availableforsale portfolio due to the timing of those transfers the balance sheet impact of that repositioning will become more apparent when we report third quarter results total interest expense increased million during the second quarter primarily due to a basis point increase in the average rate of interest bearing liabilities while those related to average balances fell billion the average effective rate of interest bearing deposits increased basis points this quarter average earning assets decreased billion compared to the last quarter primarily due to the intentional decline in the trading securities portfolio used to support our brokerage and trading business we just noted excluding the million linked quarter decline in ppp loans average loan balances increased million interestbearing cash decreased million average total deposits declined billion with noninterest bearing deposits increasing million and interestbearing balances decreasing billion this quarter which was consistent with our expectations given the movement in shortterm interest rates net interest margin was a basis point increase from the previous quarter with the increase the combination of the billion linked quarter decline in earning assets and the basis point increase in loan yields the yield on our trading portfolio increased basis points as we repositioned that portfolio with higher coupon bonds with our current assetsensitive position and given expectations for further increases in shortterm rates as the fed continues their aggressive posture against inflation we expect to capture significant benefit throughout the remainder of if the fed moves at least basis points in july then we will materially move beyond the impact of loan floors and would anticipate topping a margin in late third or early fourth quarter turning to slide we highlight further our assetsensitive balance sheet position and expect our performance in a rising rate environment to be similar to that experienced during the last rate hiking cycle from to using our standard modeling assuming a parallel shift up basis points gradually over months net interest revenue would increase or approximately million over the following months the total benefit increase is or million however with a flatter yield curve expected versus a parallel shift up our bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 estimates for up basis points would be approximately half those levels ill provide more color in a moment when i talk about our specific guidance for net interest income on slide you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio increased to this quarter from at march due to the combined impact of an million decrease in total deposits and a million increase in loan balances this quarter our significant onbalance sheet liquidity leaves us well positioned to meet future increase in customer loan demand our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well above regulatory thresholds with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market at the current price level we will continue to be active in repurchasing shares during the third quarter turning to slide linked quarter total expenses decreased million all of that decline is coming from personnel expense variable compensation expense decreased million and employee benefit expenses decreased million due to seasonal decrease in payroll taxes these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in regular compensation expense as we recognized the full quarter of expense related to annual merit increases we have been successful in managing staffing costs during the tight labor market but realize that current market conditions continue to present a risk going forward nonpersonnel expense was flat linkedquarter with most expense categories having slight increases compared to the first quarter offset by lower occupancy expense on slide ill provide guidance on a few areas as we begin the second half of we expect loan growth to continue the solid performance seen in the first and second quarters with periodend pointtopoint total loan growth for the year approaching a doubledigit rate we expect a continued reduction in deposit balances with the pointtopoint decline in the upper singledigit range for considering accelerated loan growth and moderate pressure on deposits our liquidity position is expected to remain strong with a loantodeposit ratio of approximately by yearend considering the items noted above and modeling an additional basis point increase in shortterm rates during consistent with a flattening forward curve we expect core net interest income excluding the impact of ppp loans yearoveryear to grow approximately versus the prior year core net interest margin should expand throughout the remainder of and given this environment should exceed before yearend in fact our june margin was we expect to maintain the availableforsale securities portfolio flat for the remainder of the year and reinvest cash flows at current rates no additional transfers to heldtomaturity are anticipated total fee revenues are expected to be to lower than second quarter results as we saw record derivative activity seasonality of tax fees and well continue pressure with mortgage banking into the third quarter total fee revenues as a percent of total revenues is expected to remain near during total operating expense should be approximately million to million per quarter for the remainder of bringing total expenses for the year below and our efficiency ratio below our corporate goal of by the end of the year our current combined loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances is we expect this ratio to migrate downward though continued loan growth at the current pace will increase the probability of resuming a bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 provision in future quarters we expect to continue opportunistic quarterly share repurchases at the upper level of the dollar range spent over the past several quarters ill now turn the call back over to stacy for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven im very excited about this quarters results we ended the year with a focus on growing top line revenue and our team is delivering those results across the board our lending teams have really hit their stride not only growing our balance sheet this quarter but also creating opportunities for future growth as commitment growth outpaced loan fundings this is especially impressive given our commercial lending group and their support teams completed significant transformational projects during the quarter we successfully implemented a new loan origination platform significantly updated our treasury platform and introduced a commercial portal from an operational and efficiency standpoint this positions us well to leverage those investments going forward although revenues from our mortgagefocused business lines have slowed as markets adjust to rising mortgage rates weve taken appropriate steps to adapt to the new environment weve reset our balance sheet strategy for mortgagerelated trading securities and weve done some surgical rightsizing of our expenses within our mortgage origination space despite the impact from equity markets our fiduciary fees continued to grow as rising rates eliminate fee waivers and our sales force generates new business transaction card revenues continued to grow as well as our ancillary lending fees related to commodity hedging and syndication activity we achieved all this with a continued emphasis on expense control weve been intentional about positioning our balance sheet to benefit from rising rates with evidence this quarter as core loan yields increased materially and we expect that to continue as the federal reserve moves aggressively to increase shortterm interest rates we will see expanding margins and revenue credit quality just keeps getting better and is the best weve experienced in a long time though it is likely unsustainable the business profile of our geographic footprint remains exceptional and when combined with bokfs longheld credit discipline will serve us well if the economy slows in future periods with that were pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you very much sir ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a questionand answer session operator instructions our first question is from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to start with the guidance for spread income which is now growth i think before it was growth so it was revised a little lower which was just a little surprising it seems like with rates doing what theyre doing the nii commentary is better so i just wanted to see kind of why the change there i know youre expecting deposit balances to be a little lower so maybe that has something to do with it but loan growth is still robust so maybe just the dynamics that went into kind of the lower nii guide steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah let me clarify that a little bit because really the dynamics of whats going on have really not changed we just lowered the trading portfolio from the first quarter to the second quarter and then on into our forecast so we had i think in the first quarter about billion average in our trading portfolio and going forward its going to be about billion so that trading portfolio earns a nice spread and contributes to net interest income so we dropped that balance thats what went from the why it went from to but my expectation for the third quarter is that nii should grow somewhere between million and million for the next couple of quarters each you only saw it grow about million this quarter because of that drop in the trading portfolio so now that weve reset that position for that portfolio within the dynamics of improvement in loan spreads and yields our continued control and deposit costs and overall asset sensitivity were going to grow net interest income million to million for the next couple of quarters brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp and hopefully that clarifies a little bit brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that does thank you and then just next on the provision i mean you guys have had a negative to zero provision for a while now it sounds like you could have something in that line item going forward but i just really wondered about the reserve and reserves are basis points in percentage terms i think you said that could continue to go down from here i was just wondering how you think about kind of the floor on where that reserve could land over time steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah well its hard to anticipate a floor but i do see it migrating down towards that kind of day one cecl level which is ph now whether we get there i dont know i think what we wanted to share is that we likely will need to provide at some point in the future for the loan growth that weve got i mean our loan growth is significant and who knows what the economic outlook will be the next quarter or two but the loan growth itself will drive likely some need for provisioning just because of the size of it but all that dynamic together i still believe the ph slides downward a bit brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me i mean ive heard your comments about overdraft some overdraft changes being implemented in the fourth quarter which will take million a quarter away from fee income are you thinking about anything on the nsf side or are there any other changes that youre thinking about that would impact service charges beyond that million per quarter stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp no thats pretty encompassing well announce those as we get into the late third or early fourth quarter but we wanted to signal that they will have an impact its not a huge number for us the consumer overdraft nsf charges arent a terribly large number for us i think for the year its about million or million a year in fee revenue so itll impact that about million a quarter with some changes starting in the fourth quarter but that will largely be related to overdraft and nsf fees brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color guys operator thank you the next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe looking at loan growth especially ci growth youre putting up some great numbers there when you look at that growth in commitments is that new customers and taking market share or is that your customers just feeling more optimistic and dropping and creating new lines and creating new projects to look for marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah this is marc maun i would say its a combination of both weve been successful in acquiring new customers and as well as seeing some of our customers expand take advantage of the opportunities now with the economy and put take on some of the projects they may have put off for a while and i think what the key here is that the breadth of our growth is across all our geographies and really all our lines of business on the commercial side and especially on the ci side so weve just seen an overall positive impact going for the last six months nine months and we expect it to continue stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah this is stacy and i think marc said that well what i was most encouraged about was how widespread the growth was across the geographies and loan types it wasnt one particular segment that was kind of carrying the day but really widespread across all of our geographies and different loan types and so that was really encouraging and were encouraged about the pipeline that we see going into the last half of this year as well jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc when you look at that pipeline or that growth outlook for the year does that assume that the utilization rate normalizes this year or starts to normalize or is that just looking at the pipeline and assuming a flat utilization rate marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp no were not assuming that the utilization is going to normalize were looking at just general growth from our customer base new customer relationships as well as expansion opportunities to add to the portfolio if we are able to get increased utilization it will just benefit us further jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess shifting on to the deposit side how should we think about that deposit mix with the overall balance deposit balance going down should we are you still able to grow dda going forward and is that also coming from just new relationships bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well it appears that way i mean weve seen growth in dda every quarter even in the consumer portfolio this quarter it grew so i dont anticipate that that drops that significantly i think you will have migration with some of your wealth customers and maybe some of your commercial customers who find somewhere else to put their dollars to earn a little bit higher with higher rates so thats why weve kind of guided to an overall decline in deposits by the end of the year but the dda in the mix has held exceptionally strong and i dont know that i see that changing stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp now this is stacy i think that the our commercial and treasury platform continues to perform very well and our sales team there are exceptional and our dda growth has been very good and we dont see how that materially changes here as we move forward marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp and this is marc ill only add one thing here one of the things weve also seen is our treasury services revenue stream on a p times v basis has been growing at doubledigit rate for the last months so that could be driving some of that dda growth as well because our service charges are partially covered by some of those balances jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess historically when you look at the deposit rate deposit data you highlighted through the last cycle if we see i guess what could cause that to go higher than and if we do get the next or higher basis point move could we get to that level in short order here steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so ph let me kind of clarify so the first basis point increase which weve already seen our beta was about the next basis point increase that we have built in our forecast the beta is closer to so the average for the year is close to that basis points that were talking about but to your point future rate increases which we have built in our forecast do carry a higher beta up to that level is what were anticipating and well just see if that plays out but we think that should be pretty close to what happens jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from brett rabatin of hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp hello brett stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted to first ask it was good to see the rebound in all the fee income lines of business and i guess i was a little surprised that the wealth management fees were up despite the decline in the aum can you talk maybe about the dynamics there and then maybe just a little better outlook on that line item in particular scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp sure ill take a first stab at that this is scott a couple of factors that moved the needle probably most significantly in the quarter we talked about a bit one is when you think about of our total auma being in cash we started to we were able to stop waiving fees on our money market funds we increased our revenue share on outside money market funds so that gave us lift in the quarter additionally we had a significant tax seasonal inflow in the quarter which helped and aided and so i think all of that coupled with as stacy mentioned we had very strong new sales new relationships really across the various lines of wealth management for the quarter and then the only drag on that was the roughly onethird that experienced the most significant market decline in the quarter which were the equity components so really thats kind of the dynamic that we saw playing out in the course of the quarter brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great thats helpful scott and then i wanted to just to make sure i understood the loan growth guidance it sounds like youre talking about loan growth being similar in the back half to the first half but given the guidance for it to be approaching doubledigit it does assume somewhat of a slowdown are we i assume we are expecting a bit of a slowdown relative to the second quarter and or im not sure if i understand specific guidance around the back half of the year marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp well weve experienced to annualized growth the last two quarters and thats very strong and im a little reluctant to put out there i do think our commercial portfolio likely grows that level our wealth portfolio has grown well but not at that level or likely not at that level going forward so i dont know you take all of it together i think our guidance is around that doubledigit mark but i was a little reluctant to put loan growth out not knowing exactly what the economy is going to do in the third and fourth quarter stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thats really where the conservatism bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp brett thats really where the conservatism is i think that theres a lot of momentum there and the pipelines are very good and i think as we look at that we just kind of wanted to think about that with a little bit of conservatism just because particularly as you get into the fourth quarter its hard to know exactly what borrower behavior will be and so were awfully optimistic about what weve done and what the pipeline looks like going forward brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then just lastly for me on expenses and the guidance for million to million for the back half of the year is that a reflection of personnel expenses bumping back up ph following your compensationrelated expenses in or can you give a little color on steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think youre likely going to see our stock price a little higher which is going to drive some variable comp in our stock equity accruals i think it also has an impact on our deferred compensation those two items that you saw that we benefited from in the second quarter will likely turn the other direction and be a little bit higher than that million thats why im pointing towards the million number or a little more i dont think its going to be general regular salaries or part timetype salaries you saw million increase because of merit increases in the second quarter and thats our timing for that so you wont have that recur in the third and fourth quarter so i think it is personnel costs that drives it a little bit higher in the third and fourth quarter but its mostly variable comp and deferred comp related brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great steven thats helpful appreciate all the color guys operator thank you very much the next question is from peter winter of wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks good morning i had two questions on the yields first could you just tell us how much is cash flowing each quarter on the securities portfolio and what the reimbursement rates is versus the yields of the securities running off steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 yeah so we got about million of cash flow quarterly from the availableforsale portfolio that well reinvest and theyre going to be at just normal mortgagebacked security rates which i dont know what those guys are getting exactly today but theyre up close to i would say but i can give you more of an exact answer peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and versus stuff thats rolling off steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah theyre yeah i mean definitely the that you see in availableforsale thats going to migrate up maybe it gets closer to or so in the next quarter or so peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay so that loan yield increase is very impressive basis points so is there anything like interest recoveries that elevated that that might revert a little bit next quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no theres not theres nothing inside there that really boosted it kind of artificially if you will its a pretty normal rate and i think youll expect that to go higher well see what the fed does today but most of these price relatively quickly upward and so yeah i expect good response in that overall portfolio yield as we move into the third quarter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and just my last question obviously i have covered you guys for a while and youve never done it in the past but im just wondering if theres any thoughts on maybe adding swaps to manage the asset sensitivity and maybe protect the margin when the fed starts to cut rates just given the asset sensitive balance sheet steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp historically weve not done that weve really used onbalance sheet ph out of cash positions in our securities portfolio there may be a point where we decide we want to grow the portfolio and take off some asset sensitivity were not at that point today but no were not contemplating putting on any swaps just at the moment peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks operator thank you very much the next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc please go ahead bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc this is probably for stacy and marc just on energy sometimes we love it sometimes we hate it i think we love it right now and just if you guys could give us an overall view of how you feel about the energy markets today i know youre pretty consistent on it but any more cautiousness on underwriting and any changes in your appetite there and just generally what are you seeing from clients stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp i mean this has been a really historic opportunity for bok financial to take market share really strong growth in syndication were leading a high percentage of the deals that were involved with today customers understand risk management practices so thats why you saw a record second quarter hedging revenue with commodity prices spiking from an underwriting perspective we feel very good about what were doing we have a cap on oil at and a cap on natural gas at so while we traditionally use the forward markets and a forward strip to price the collateral we have capped that at a level well below the current strip price so we feel very good about that its always been a great portfolio for us even in the downtimes that weve been through we performed exceptionally well and actually as people begin to think about the potential for a recession or a downturn in the economy its really hard for us to envision a dramatic downturn in our footprint states given the support that commodities will have in oklahoma and texas colorado and new mexico in particular the likelihood that you could have a better regional outcome in this footprint that we are in than other parts of the country is very high with commodity prices at the level that they are today weve had six years of underinvestment in the energy space and so this isnt something that is likely resolved in a short period of time i think commodity prices are going to stay higher on a relative basis they could go lower than they are today particularly natural gas but still on a relative basis be much higher than theyve been the last several years and support our local economies at a high level marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp and jon ill just add that as weve continued through this cycle our hedging program continues to be substantial so both our oil weighted and gas weighted customers still are over weighted or hedged in excess of as much as into throughout so that gives us further comfort when were looking at if theres a bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 potential drop in prices beyond our underwriting ability so weve maintained that kind of level going forward and as we ran our stress test we ran a discount to our entire to the price deck in total and still saw very little impact to the overall portfolio quality jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you thats very helpful and then just steven now one for you on slide on your asset sensitivity steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc help me understand that a little bit more i think what youre saying is that to 24month number is in addition to the to 12month number is that steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc the right way to look at it okay steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats right but also look at the asterisk there too because i dont want to over i dont want to overestimate what it could be that is our normal parallel shift that we put in our 10q but im being conservative here because i think the flattening curve scenario is probably more likely and it would cut that number in half but it is additive to the previous year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah but the relative ratio holds is i guess what im kind of getting at steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp correct yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and i guess bigger picture you just look at the last few months and assuming we get basis points today thats a little over basis points so youre saying yes youre getting benefits today but based on the repricing of your portfolio the benefits would really start to come third quarter of even though we see the benefits today youre saying theres even more to come is that indiscernible bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think thats true i think thats correct yeah were set up to benefit significantly in the third and fourth quarter if rates continue to rise we think thats going to happen today and thats our expectation thats why i think i wanted to highlight earlier i did in the call we only grew million between the two quarters but that wasnt because from dynamic with our sensitivity that was more just the size of our trading book and if you right size that and carry that on out for the rest of the quarters then youve got a significant bump in nii to that million to million a quarter level as long as loans continue to grow and the rates continue to rise thats how were set up jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right that all makes sense thank you guys operator thank you very much the next question is from matt olney of stephens inc please go ahead steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hello matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey good morning want to start on the nii guidance for the year i think that excludes the impact of ppp steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats right matt olney q analyst stephens inc im not sure youre talking about the same thing do you have what the dollar amount of the ppp fees were last year at least the starting point steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah we do yeah so in we had a benefit of about million roughly of nii and fees related to ppp that would be in nii and then this year its about million so theres a million differential between the two years and if you account for that and look at what our nii forecast is i think well grow over last year now thats down from that we said last quarter in our guidance but we had not adjusted our trading portfolio downward like we have today and i think in the second quarter that trading portfolio was million different in nii or interest revenue than what we had had in our previous forecast so thats why i modified that guidance matt olney q analyst stephens inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 okay and that guidance should get us to that million to million incremental improvement in each of the next two quarters is that right steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yes thats correct matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay got it i think you said within that it assumes the trading portfolio maintains around that billion level did i hear that right steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp right matt olney q analyst stephens inc and i guess that would be a increase from the endofperiod level but youre steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah its around billion to billion average for those two quarters off of an billion to billion average we had previously so that guidance adjusts for that portfolio being smaller matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay okay its helpful and then i guess on the fees good to see the rebound in the brokerage and credit line i want to make sure i appreciate kind of whats going on here i think the trading line last quarter was a loss of million do you have what the dollar amount for that line was in and then i guess how confident are you that youve captured all the potential losses from moving some of those lower coupon bonds off the balance sheet that weve talked about last april steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i can address that latter question i know that we ended up selling out of all of those bonds in the quarter for about million to million more than we had marked those bonds in the first quarter so we came out better certainly in the sale of the tail of those bonds than what we had marked them when we closed last quarter thats the answer for the latter part of the question marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp and to your first part matt page in the investor deck really breaks out in more granular detail that brokerage and trading line item so you can see in the second quarter it was million in trading fees for the second quarter of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then just lastly on this topic i guess help me appreciate just increasing the size of that trading portfolio back up to that ph million to million that we brought it down quite a bit over the last few quarters just strategically kind of weve increased it we brought it back down now were bringing it back up just help me appreciate that scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah so this is scott so i think that as weve talked about in terms of the factors that influence the just precipitous rise in short rates in the first quarter and the market volatility we had significant challenges to liquidity in that mortgagebacked securities sector and as steven yeah detailed we liquidated our lowest coupon mortgagebacked securities in the first quarter because we believed and i think rightly so that we were going to be entering a period with not just rising rates but a significant amount of fixed income uncertainty so we feel like as weve adjusted the size of that trading securities portfolio to now to that billion to billion level that positions us for the current market conditions so if we over the course of the remainder of the year began to see rate and fixed income clarity and confidence return then wed consider returning it the larger levels that it was previously but in the current market conditions where we see a lot of uncertainty and volatility we feel very comfortable about that portfolio size to support our mortgage origination customer base and the current kind of outlook for rates and the flatness of the curve stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp matt this is stacy i mean if you think about just mortgage production overall were just the market is just not creating as much inventory with new paper being originated and so as a result of that that activity is going to be at a lower level than it was when you saw really strong mortgage markets overall in the third and fourth quarter last year the other thing that were starting to see some signs of life in is on the municipal trading side thats picked up a little bit here in the second quarter and that may help us a little bit as we move forward as well matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys operator thank you the next question is from gary tenner of d a davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning everybody steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hello gary bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co hey i wanted to ask about the components of loan growth back half of the year i got on the call late so i apologize if you went through this but my sense is that the pipeline and growth expectations remain pretty well weighted to commercial and im just curious about in the commercial real estate side we had a big kind of surge i guess in the first quarter and then we were flat to could you talk about what youre seeing in terms of pipelines transaction demand and if youre maybe seeing more projects that maybe dont pencil out at higher rates marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp well this is marc i would say first of all to the latter part of that were certainly employing the same discipline weve always employed and so were trying to be selective and pick the best credits that we can the volume of opportunities is still there were just maybe being a little bit more selective and then what we saw in the second quarter was a lot of new commitments that we booked that are more constructionrelated and will not fund immediately but we expect those to start to fund out for the remainder of the year so thats when well see the loan growth and outstandings is as those projects are funded going forward gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you and in terms of the rate sensitivity i just wonder if steven you could tell us in terms of the of commercial and commercial real estate thats variable rate or indiscernible could you drill a little more into the variable rate say either prime or indiscernible libor to be a little more specific on what how were thinking about indiscernible steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp either is libor or sofr and its most of its centered around day so it moves very quickly gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you very much steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp you bet operator thank you the last question is from jennifer demba of truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc question on the senior housing portfolio when ive asked some bankers over the last six months or so what kinds of loans they see as vulnerable if we go into a recession some bankers have cited that area im wondering what your thoughts are and what youre seeing in your portfolio stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp well i dont believe that the senior housing portfolio is as sensitive to recession as it is to more what the government does around medicare and medicaid rates and what weve seen in terms of covid and et cetera those have been the headwinds that have been experienced and the positive is that the medicare and medicaid rates have been improving while the covid situation is getting better too so we would expect occupancy to start to improve so from that standpoint i dont think the recession is going to change the demographics of the population that would reduce the demand that would require senior housing marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp jennifer this is not a new portfolio for us and weve had it through previous recessions including the more severe recession and the credit outcomes in that portfolio have been very very strong we havent made any changes in our underwriting or liberalized how we look at that in any way so i wouldnt expect a materially different performance absent government changes in reimbursement for medicaremedicaid jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great appreciate that color and perspective thanks a lot steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp youre welcome operator thank you very much ladies and gentlemen weve reached the end of questionandanswer session and id
