expansion which will complement our existing fixed income trading activities bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 talent acquisition is a fundamental part of our strategy we proactively recruit for our future knowing that our greatest asset is our people im thrilled to announce that we were recognized as one of only organizations to receive the gallup exceptional workplace award this is independent validation of our culture of inspiration ambition collaboration and tenacity discipline is key to generating value and one differentiator i wanted to highlight for us is our credit culture if you look back to the great financial crisis while our credit costs were well above our own average we materially outperformed our peers this and our holistic risk management focus contributed to us being the largest traditional bank not to participate in tarp industrywide credit costs have been very low over the last several years but with growing concerns in the regional banking space there is renewed focus on credit and particularly commercial real estate we never lost sight of managing credit prudently and believe this is an area where we will continue to outperform on a relative basis we have maintained the same credit standards with a consistent credit management team that led to better credit losses versus peers historically weve added a slide to our presentation that shows our historical credit performance by line of business to highlight our impressive longterm performance combining strong historical credit performance with an ongoing commitment around concentration limits should give investors further confidence in our ability to perform well in this area moving forward we have a commercial real estate concentration limit of of total commitments versus tier capital and reserves and today we have approximately of outstanding balances in commercial real estate over the years we have focused on growing our specialty lines of business like energy and health care which has increased our core commercial and industrial relationship weve made investments in our core commercial businesses over the last several years and we see those returns evident in the first quarter with annualized growth in commercial loans another way you see us taking the long view is in the retention of our visa class b stock many have fully monetized their shares since at a considerable discount we held on to this position and now expect to receive full value for the shares we hold moving to slide periodend loan balances increased million or linked quarter with growth driven by commercial loans and our teams remain confident in our pipelines as we move forward both periodend and average deposits continue to grow this quarter our loan to deposit ratio declined slightly to remaining well below our peers and providing significant on balance sheet liquidity to meet future loan or other liquidity demands we have now been two consecutive quarters with a slowing pace of net interest margin declines and we believe we are at the trough our credit remains very strong and we have a combined reserve of million or of outstanding loans at quarter end which is above the median of our peer group finally we repurchased over  this quarter to reflect our longterm confidence in the company and to take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations im proud of the quarter that this team has put together and appreciate the time to review it with you this morning with that ill turn the call over to marc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp thanks stacy i wanted to take a moment to reference slide and reinforce stacys comments regarding credit our credit culture is fundamental to the way we do business we have strong underwriting standards that are calibrated to our experience in each of our lines of business which involves not only a base evaluation of credit but also stress testing during the underwriting process including all loans being subjected to interest rate shocks our process is a consistent disciplined approach designed to avoid fluctuating standards based on economic conditions approximately of our commercial and cre loans are floating rate or repriced in the next year so this variable has always been a principal factor for us the current credit performance youre seeing in our loan book is already reflective of higher borrowing rates we dont have a significant concern over payment shocks as we actively manage the book we monitor credit to identify issues we are quick to downgrade any loans that we are concerned with which can on occasion make our criticized ratios look higher than peers we believe this proactive management results in better longterm outcomes if an issue with credit arises we collaborate with clients to rehabilitate exit with full repayment or minimize loss via cooperative effort with management line bankers and our special assets team combining our prudent standards on the frontend during the underwriting process and active management throughout the life of a loan has historically resulted in very modest credit losses which is illustrated on slide turning to slide overall loans increased linked quarter with commercial loans up and cre down portfolio yields increased basis points during the quarter loan balances in the energy business increased linked quarter as a reminder our energy book is composed of approximately oilweighted borrowers and natural gasweighted borrowers of the book is firstlien senior secured production with lending evaluated and stress tested by our inhouse engineering staff of fulltime employees our energy customers are very well hedged for at least the next year which meaningfully lowers our commodity pricing risk on the collateral combined services and general business loans our core ci loans grew linked quarter our focus in this market is on developing full banking relationships through cash flow lending while structuring our credits with adequate secondary sources of repayment to minimize our risk our healthcare business loans increased linked quarter roughly twothirds of the portfolio is in senior housing combining a diversified mix of skilled nursing facilities that are medicare or medicaidbased stabilized private pay senior living integrated health systems predominantly with investmentgrade equivalent ratings and other specialized providers the healthcare line of business has a national footprint but is focused on regional operators with multiple locations for diversity and deep knowledge of their markets we have a long history of strong underwriting in this space our cre business decreased quarteroverquarter as stacy mentioned we manage to strict concentration loans are subjected to multiple stress tests in the underwriting process including those that stress interest rates and payment shocks setting aside our disciplined underwriting standards we believe that there are two key factors that will differentiate our credit performance in this cycle first is guarantor support we have meaningful support in over of our cre loans with counterparties that we have known for a long time and have demonstrated commitment to supporting their transaction bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 second is geographic location this portfolio is geographically diverse but importantly with most exposure within strong economies in our footprint and very little exposure in the areas of the country that have seen the largest pullback in prices such as new york city and los angeles which is shown on the following slide on slide you will notice credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio and well below historical norms and prepandemic levels nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies decreased million this quarter the resulting nonperforming assets at the periodend loans and repossessed assets decreased basis points to basis points nonaccruing loans decreased million linked quarter committed criticized assets continue to remain well below prepandemic levels as a percentage of capital net chargeoffs were million or basis points annualized for the first quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months extending the trend of performance far beyond our historic loss range of basis points to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to remain below historical norms we remain well reserved with a combined allowance for credit losses of million or of outstanding loans at quarterend with the million provision reflecting a stable operating environment and loan growth expectations the reserve is sufficient to cover our nonperforming assets by three times we believe the combined reserve is the most appropriate metric to consider if you want a holistic view of comparative credit reserve levels we expect to continue to maintain an appropriate reserve supporting loan growth and reflective of economic conditions as i mentioned in my opening comments we have traditionally outperformed during challenging credit cycles and are wellpositioned should an economic slowdown materialize and now ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp thank you marc turning to slide im excited to speak to our wealth management mortgage and transfund businesses these are businesses that we have been committed to for a long time and run as deep as our roots in we launched the first trust company in oklahoma and added asset management in demonstrating our commitment to innovative financial services for our clients today bokf provides a rock solid foundation of stability knowledge and experience that individuals families and institutions can rely on we operate these fee income businesses at scale which gives us strong operational leverage and the ability to compete well with larger organizations we made the strategic decision to invest in these and other high roe fee income businesses that provide revenue diversity which has played out well for us of bokfs revenue comes from fee income businesses which is a peer leading contribution to earnings and provides stability especially when net interest income exhibits volatility to mention a few stats that demonstrate the scale and strength of these businesses we are a top dealer of agency mortgagebacked securities the number one underwriter and financial advisor of texas independent school district bonds for the eight largest corporate trustee bank ranked by number of trusteeships a top electronic funds transfer processor in the united states through our transfund business which provides debit and credit issuing processing or eft for almost banks and credit unions throughout the us representing bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 close to billion transactions last year alone and finally were a top us mortgage originator and service over billion in mortgage loans representing more than accounts turning to this quarter total fee income contributed million of revenue representing of total revenue ill first cover the detail of our markets and securities businesses again on slide our trading fees which are constituted primarily in fixed income trading increased by to million during the quarter driven by slightly higher trading volumes and spreads versus the prior quarter mortgage banking revenue increased to million this was driven by improvement in the mortgage origination market and positive seasonal trends resulting in increased volume margins have also increased as the pooling of covid19 forbearance loans we previously repurchased continues to migrate lower now reaching some of their lowest historical levels as a reminder brokerage and insurance was down to million this was due to the exit of bok financial insurance in the fourth quarter last year turning to slide to cover our asset management and transaction businesses asset management revenue has also increased to million driven by an increase in auma of just under million with spreads increasing slightly transaction card revenue decreased by to million driven by normalized activity following elevated levels experienced in  feebased businesses tend to have a higher return on capital versus traditional net interest income related businesses but also a higher efficiency ratio as you must build scale and cost structure to operate them effectively therefore as you see with the percentage of fee income increase you should expect to see a higher efficiency ratio and a higher return on capital and now ill hand the call over to marty to cover the financials martin e grunst chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you scott let me start by covering two items in the quarter first we accrued million as an estimate of the additional special assessment we expect from the fdic in june of this year second as previously disclosed weve repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio in march taking a million pretax charge for the quarter which will improve net interest income going forward we hold visa b shares that are currently equivalent to common shares visas exchange program was initiated on april and should allow us to monetize of our b shares in the second quarter the anticipated gain from this exchange in  should more than offset the million securities loss we took in  leaving a residual amount that we expect to contribute to our charitable foundation in  and one last observation on this topic when it comes to portfolio restructuring our focus is on generating incremental economic value and we look for the earnback period to be shorter than the weighted average life of the securities involved for the  transaction the payback period was roughly years versus a weighted average life of years for the securities sold indicating a very good economic pickup turning to slide capital and liquidity continue to be robust driven by our risk management framework which recognizes the capital liquidity and interest rate risk management are all interconnected disciplines our adjusted tangible common equity ratio inclusive of all securities portfolio losses stands at when comparing this capital metric to that of the largest banks in the us as of  ours is the third highest bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 additionally we have strong capital ratios across each of the regulatory capital metrics our current loan to deposit ratio stands at and our coverage of uninsured and noncollateralized deposits has remained robust at with this quarters deposit growth of billion being very wellpositioned in capital and liquidity has enabled us to actively pursue organic growth opportunities as well as share buybacks during the first quarter we repurchased just over  of common stock at an average price of per share we will continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase over the coming quarters turning to slide first quarter net interest income was million and the pace of decline continued to subside as expected the linked quarter decrease was million with million of that due to day count net interest margin was a basis point decrease compared to  primarily driven by dda migration and to a lesser extent by deposit repricing at the end of the first quarter our through the cycle deposit beta was and dda was of total deposits turning to slide linked quarter total expenses decreased million or mostly attributable to the fdic special assessment in the prior quarter we recognized the initial assessment of million in the fourth quarter and another million in the first quarter this results in a linked quarter decline of million and explains most of the total expense decline in the quarter all remaining expenses were largely consistent with prior quarter activity turning to slide this provides our outlook for we have good momentum in commercial loan growth and expect total loan growth on a periodend basis to be to weve provided a numeric range on this item but our outlook is basically the same as it was last quarter we believe net interest margin has reached the trough and total net interest income for will be just over billion we did assume rate cuts by the federal reserve in consistent with the forward curve as of a couple of weeks ago we expect provision expense to be similar to levels and the combined reserves to total loans ratio to remain steady as we grow outstandings and economic conditions persist with that i would like to hand the call back to the operator for qa which will be followed by closing remarks from stacy bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you hear me all right stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp we can now jon its good to hear from you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good good on slide i dont know if its for you stacy or marc but can you touch a little bit on the general business trends youre seeing in terms of the pipelines i know marc you combine services and general business but im just curious what youre seeing in terms of the pipelines and if theyre changing at all marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah so far when were looking at our ci pipelines we still see pretty good strength i mean our effort has been out to take advantage of opportunities given our liquidity position our credit metrics and so forth to be open for business and active calling efforts and when some of our competitors have pulled back a little weve been able to build the pipeline pretty well when youre looking at healthcare its been growing pretty well also energy is just more reflective of just some of the things that are going on in the economy right now so overall we expect to continue to see the kind of growth on the commercial side that we experienced in the first quarter stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp jon this is stacy i mean i think if you think about it kind of how we think about it i mean commercial growth broadly given our footprint given kind of our liquidity and capital position were really optimistic about that i mean the business lines are very excited about kind of their pipelines and what they see coming over time i think the only real headwind that we dont know how to forecast particularly well is how commercial real estate will behave whether we get paydowns there if we do it takes time to kind of replace those over time we have plenty of headroom in commercial real estate to make loans today but it takes a little while there and so that i think i mentioned on the call last quarter that was really the only wild card we had i think from our guidance and i still think thats true today i think were very optimistic about commercial ph bank commercial real estate were optimistic about our ability to grow the commitments there but the timing of when those will fund will be the wildcard relative to payoffs there bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and then just one for you marty not a lot to pick on here but you talked about dda migration and curious how youre feeling about that and is the pressure burning out there any themes youd like to call out on the dda migration martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp sure yes and we do think that the pressure is burning out as you say so if you look just within the quarter the declines we saw were pretty much all in january so february and march were pretty much leveled out and then even as you look into april we saw a little bit of build in april pretax season and then on april 16th that came out and gets us where that all landed was still consistent with where we were in february and march so that gives us pretty good confidence that that is reaching a burnout point there i do think there is still just a little bit more to go so dont think that its absolutely done but we feel pretty good about the outlook jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you ill step back thanks operator well take our next question from peter winter with da davidson peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hi peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co your credit trends have been outstanding i think you guys are one of the few banks to see a decline in non performing assets could you just provide a little bit more color on the criticized and problem loans and then secondly i just guess based on the provision expense guidance youre still expecting that higher net chargeoffs in the second half of the year marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp well ill take the second part of that first with regards to provision we dont really anticipate higher net charge offs for the balance of the year our indications are based on criticized classified levels nonperforming improvement that well see something more consistent with what we have experienced in the last few quarters the higher provision would come about through loan growth and that would be the driver for it and the desire to keep our percentage reserve relatively flat to the overall loan portfolio bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 with regards to the individual criticized assets and so forth we dont see anything that is systemic in any particular portfolio and in fact our some of our cre has come down and weve been able to exit a number of our nonperforming loans which was one of the results of why we had a reduction in the last quarter as opposed to chargeoffs so weve been able to manage our criticized and classified effectively and we just think that its going to be continue to be reflected in the future based on what were seeing today peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp peter indiscernible about the credit quality here i think that you rightfully point out thats a big part of our story this quarter i think that we differentiate ourselves here in terms of how we underwrite and how we think about that we can have strong asset quality and good growth and i think were doing both of those here our kind of forecasting in asset quality is good for about six months and then it gets real heavy and so the reason weve kind of talked about maybe in the back half of the year is mostly just the expectation at some point that therell be a reversion to the mean and things will start to look like they did precovid we thought maybe we were heading that direction in the fourth quarter we had modest deterioration in criticized and classified and that kind of we were starting to begin at migration but that did not play out in the first quarter and our outlook here is very positive based on what we know about the book and how we see the current criticized classified nonperforming behaving today and so we feel really good understand at some point ive been teasing a lot internally about i keep saying its unsustainably good but it is but it feels like its going to stay that way for at least the next six months or so peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thats really helpful and then on a separate question you did maintain the fee income guidance in despite the updated outlook for two rate cuts the previous guidance was no rate cuts and you had mentioned like lower rates would actually benefit fee income so would you lean more towards maybe the upper end of the range now that youve got some rate cuts built into your forecast martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah peter id say that we do feel good about the trajectory within that business mortgage is certainly even saw a lift in mortgage and that will be sustainable and thats certainly helped by that the trading businesses are supported by that kind of environment and then the fiduciary businesses are also supported by that environment just given the asset there the impact on asset valuation so yeah we feel great about about that line item peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 and any sense on maybe if it comes in towards the upper end of the range just given now some of the benefits with rate cuts martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah i dont know i dont want to put a pinpoint on any particular part of the range but the weve certainly got good momentum in those businesses and we expect that to carry forward through the year scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp the only thing i would add this is scott is that on the trading front we settled into kind of an uncertainty period whether were going to be looking at rate cuts or not and as you can see from the first quarter the business levels and the activities continue to be slightly elevated even without the cuts so we feel good about where were positioned really regardless of the direction that the fed might take there peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks scott operator well take our next question from ben gerlinger with citi benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was just curious in terms of just the i guess the growth kind of numerical finetuning some of your competitors have kind of indicated the back half of the year whereas others and the same footprint have also said kind of more linear just if you exclude the cre kind of noise and paydown potential like should we expect growth to be fairly linear from here through the end of year or is it a little bit more weighted towards the back half stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thats a tough question to answer i think generally speaking its going to be linear more so than weighted in the back half i think thats my expectation but as you know loan growth is lumpy you have a month where its flat and you have a month where its bigger but over time that trajectory should be pretty steady and more linear from my perspective than backloaded benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 got you thats helpful and then i know that you now have two cuts in the guidance at the beginning of the year weve talked about how this quarters probably the margin trough and it seems like it should be but if you kind of look at a little bit of a mosaic here in terms of rate cut potentially if there are no rate cuts do you have any sense of where the margin might be at the end of the year assuming your normal mix shift and flows that youre anticipating martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah ben so whether we do get those two rate cuts or not we still think that our margin troughs here and see some stability here in the middle of the year and then you get an uptick later in the year you know the our benefit that we get out of rate cuts is more from the fact that you get a steeper curve and thats something that builds over time you dont get a like a gigantic benefit in one quarter from that so either way we see the margin coming up towards the end of the year stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp i mean i think thats the important point that as you think about us on a goforward basis think less about rate movements impacting net interest revenue or margin absolutely because we tend to be pretty neutral from a rate risk perspective but think more about a steepening of the yield curve to the extent that theres a steepening were going to materially benefit from that over time and so that the steepening effect has a much bigger impact to us than the absolute whether rates go up or down on the short end benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful i appreciate it thanks for ph talking to us operator well take our next question from will jones with kbw william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning will william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys so i wanted to touch on the deposit growth you guys saw this quarter i mean it was obviously fairly notable i was just hoping you could maybe just touch on what went right for you guys in the quarter i know youve called out as well trying to maybe swaps and borrowings and then replace with the deposits could you just talk us through some of the dynamics that you saw in the quarter and maybe what drove that nice growth bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so will that was us making our offers to our existing customer base and as weve talked about before we have a large portion of our customer base that has both money held on balance sheet of their liquid assets some of its held on balance sheet and some of thats held in our brokerdealer or the wealth business and that were able to toggle that back and forth with calling efforts and so we just did some of that and that was very fruitful and that just worked out exactly as designed for us william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just with respect to the deposit growth guidance it feels like maybe a lot of that growth is just pulled forward in the first part of the year here and is the thought that deposit balances maybe just kind of level out and flatline for the remainder of the year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah as a general rule we want to keep deposit growth and loan growth more or less lined up we were very comfortable with that loan to deposit ratio area defining that as a broader area and so yeah its reasonable to think that those are going to be kind of in line the rest of the year william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah yeah okay great and then back to the margin discussion here so maybe margin troughs this quarter we see stability and then up margin at the end of the year does that kind of imply that deposit costs will peak maybe in the third quarter or late in the second quarter martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes so i dont know that id say deposit cost peak in particular but the couple of drivers that are positive for margin are the fixed rate securities portfolio each quarter million or a little more will reprice from the lower existing rate to reprice up to current rates the same dynamic happens in the loan book a little smaller dollar amount but the same dynamic of pricing up that fixed rate portion of the loan book and those continue for a while in multiple quarters and then on the deposit side youre just seeing each quarter the deposit pressure just gets less and less and so that gets much smaller it might not go to actual zero but the lines cross here we believe this quarter william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thanks guys operator well take our next question from timur braziler with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 hi good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc following up on the last line of commentary just looking at time deposits of indiscernible was the average rate for the quarter whats kind of the terminal rate there and what is the offer thats currently being promoted in your markets martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes so if you just look at our highest offer you see depending on term its kind of ph million to million would be the highest particular offer and thats not every market has the same offer but thats the high point and we actually brought those down versus a quarter ago by or basis points and so that gives you a sense for a little bit of the easing pressure that were seeing its hard to say exactly what the endpoint is because its not everything goes to that high offer because that particular term merged with particular specials so its the terminal point is certainly lower than that and itll just kind of depend on the mix within that portfolio but youre right that does kind of indiscernible slowdown if you will over time timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just your broader appetite for time deposits here so loan to deposit ratio now below you have plenty balance sheet liquidity is your appetite still the same for time deposits or could we actually see some of those maturities maybe roll off during the course of the year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp those are all core customers i mean none of that is anything thats like brokered or any of that so its not like theres a piece that is just going to roll off and go away were going to serve what customers are after and so a fair amount of thats in the consumer book and so thats just kind of natural how a consumer book matures over a rate this part of the rate cycle so we would expect that to continue to grow slowly as that consumer book just naturally makes that trend stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and if youre concerned that were adding the cds at the time when the markets beginning to see rate declines and so does that lock you into some higher cost of funds because of the growth there you know were set up and we can swap those back to floating through our treasury function as we begin to have a view around that so that were not necessarily locked into that from a fixed rate perspective bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 we think thats a core deposit gathering operation that we need to have consistently going on and so how we think about that will toggle with whether we swap it back to floating or really around our interest rate risk profile and how we think about that but you have to think about it more holistically than just that particular line item martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp and those maturities are in the within a year and some go a little bit longer in a year those line up well with the fixed rate portion of the loan book and like stacy said to the extent that they dont line up well very easily swap those so thatll work out well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thats good color and then maybe just a couple around the credit side so looking at healthcare specifically and im referring to slide indiscernible were seeing broader issues kind of pop up across the industry within that sector and then you look at your healthcare portfolio prepandemic and postpandemic and the results are pretty stark i guess what changed in your maybe underwriting or anything else thats driving such outperformance postpandemic in that portfolio versus higher levels of chargeoff activities in and stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i dont know that our i dont see our performance is materially different here i mean healthcare over a broad range of time has been a very strong asset quality portfolio for us its always had more volatility around criticized and classified level because the risk in that portfolio that we see is typically classification risk not loss risk and so our historical performance from a loss perspective in the healthcare book has been very strong we had a couple of noncore type healthcare loans years ago that we had some losses around but the portfolio is structured today around senior housing and healthcare systems and doctor practice groups and things like that that portfolio has been around for a long time and has been a very strong credit performer for us and how we underwrite its consistent and we feel really good about that i dont think youre always vulnerable to having some classification risk in the healthcare book just because of the nature of it but the loss history which is really what we focus on has been very stable in the core businesses that were in today marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah and the only thing ill add is there was just a segment of healthcare that we were in early or mid that we exited like in that is no longer part of the portfolio the core portfolio has always been the senior housing which has been the stable portfolio timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just last for me i know its a small component but maybe the npl inflows from commercial real estate what asset classes were those in and any kind of underlying thread between some of those migrations bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp could you ask that again you cut out for us just a second timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc sure so the npl migration this quarter for our commercial real estate what sectors those were in and if theres any kind of underlying thread that tie those loans stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i mean if you look at nonperforming loans for commercial real estate really modest increase its mostly attributable to single office facility we took a modest chargeoff on it this quarter and we expect it to be sold for no additional loss content by the end of the quarter so we dont have any specific concerns around loss content today really was a single largely comprised of a single loan there which is the increase there timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the questions operator well take our next question from matt olney with stephens matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning everybody martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning matt stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc just a general question i want to ask about the overall level of competition within your core lending businesses i think over the last few quarters weve talked about competitors pulling back and providing some opportunities for the bank to add new customers im just curious if theres any change here are these competitors kind of still on their back feet and then just kind of any update on loan spreads thanks stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp i think the what you saw really was some of the regional banks and the larger regional banks trying to manage their capital levels and liquidity levels and so were less aggressive particularly on the larger end of the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 corporate side and weve seen some benefit from that i would say generally speaking theyre starting to put their toe back in the water a little bit not maybe like they were before last spring but starting to come back into the market a little bit there i think that i think spreads are generally on the larger in the corporate side are going to be stable i think until we get more clarity around basel iii endgame and then maybe they widened a little bit there as folks figure out what the capital structure has to be but generally speaking i would say corporate spreads have remained relatively flat and thats our expectation that we see today even with some being less aggressive perhaps than theyve been in the past matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay appreciate that stacy and then on the expense side appreciate that the guidance here that you gave no rule change but just remind me of the variability of that expense base and if we were to assume the higher end of fees for the year is it also reasonable that we should be assuming the higher end of the expense guidance martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so on two businesses in particular mortgage and brokerage and trading those have a pretty direct link into the expense base but those are really the two that you see that tight connectivity and then just generally on expenses well continue to make investments in the it space and so the fees the thirdparty fees and the data processing costs you might see some variability there and then as you kind of know the mortgage expenses those are seasonally low in the first quarter and those are predictably a little higher than the other three quarters but those are the only things id point out matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks matt operator operator instructions and well take our next question from brandon king with truist securities brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning brandon bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i noticed that unfunded commitments ticked down in the quarter so i was wondering if you could provide us any context behind that marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp the only thing weve really seen is weve been able to generate new business and a lot of it is not being actively used yet were in the construction piece of it that has to fund up over time and on the commercial side weve just seen utilization stay flat while weve added new customers so the unfunded commitments is a reflection of just increased commitments overall and stable utilization rates martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp other than the commercial real estate marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp right martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp where theyre using theirs over time and so thats where you see one of the decline factors brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and then and lastly for me just in regards to commercial real estate could you give us an update on what youre seeing in regards to extensions for loans that come up for maturity and just where customers are at as far as their request stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i think its kind of business as usual for the most part i mean i think that as loans mature or come close to maturity we work through that just like we have in any typical cycle i think that at least thus far it just doesnt appear a whole lot different than any kind of normal course of business borrowers have the option for us to do some kind of miniperm financing so where you would put it on an amortization schedule if its through the construction phase and if the permanent market isnt accepting at that particular point in time they can do what we call a miniperm with us the loan amortizes and typically a three year type term and then they can kind of wait for the capital markets or the permanent financing markets to get in a better place bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2024 but really what weve seen and i mean weve got a very healthy portfolio i mean the first quarter we had really good payoffs in the commercial real estate book which we really attribute to kind of having a healthy portfolio and so it doesnt were not seeing anything thats kind of out of the ordinary there martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah the payoff levels that we saw this quarter were much higher than the last couple of quarters and almost felt like just normal course of business repayment rates in that portfolio which like stacy said indicates just a pretty healthy underlying portfolio brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah very helpful thank you for taking my questions stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp we said from the very beginning commercial real estate theres two things that matter geography and recourse and i think that thats really bearing out and so the fact that we have of our commercial real estate loans have some form of guarantor support and recourse is a differentiator here and were really seeing that show up in our portfolio brandon king q analyst truist securities inc great thank you heather worley a directorinvestor relations senior vice president bok financial corp thanks brandon operator and we have a followup question from timur braziler with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the indiscernible just a quick one on that line of comments who was taking you guys out on the payoff activity was it other banks insurance companies i guess where were those paydowns going to stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah largely permanent financing sources so lifecos anywhere that you typically see a longer term non recourse financing in commercial real estate is kind of where those takeouts are coming from its not coming from other banks timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call
