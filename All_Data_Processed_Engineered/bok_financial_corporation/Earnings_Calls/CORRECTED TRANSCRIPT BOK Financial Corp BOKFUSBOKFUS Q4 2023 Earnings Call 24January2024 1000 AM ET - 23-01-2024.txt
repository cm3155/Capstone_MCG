good morning everyone beginning on slide we reported net income of million or per diluted share for the fourth quarter which includes a per share impact from the fdic special assessment im exceptionally proud of the bokf team and our results this year our focus at bokf has always been on providing longterm shareholder value driven by our diverse business model and talented team both of which empowers to perform well relative to our industry during any economic environment this was once again proven when the industry faced stress in the first half of the year and our company was well prepared our disciplined risk management which extends beyond the credit risk management that has long been a strength resulted in strong levels of capital and liquidity in an important time we took advantage of this position to thoughtfully grow when others are pulling back weve made real investments in growing our core ci while also investing in people and new markets like central texas while the fourth quarter was exceptionally noisy with numerous nonrecurring items our core results were very strong resulting in a great starting point for we continue to make strategic ph decisions deploy our capital where growth and returns are highest this was reflected in our decision to exit our insurance brokerage and consulting business in the fourth quarter this resulted in a pretax gain of million after transaction expense which we used to opportunistically restructure a small portion of our available for sale securities portfolio which will be accretive to net interest revenue and the margin in the months ahead staying on this slide our efficiency ratio was for the quarter that falls to excluding the impact of the fdic special assessment and the activity related to the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business which marty will highlight later let me briefly diverge and comment on the fdic special assessment which i understand most will see as non recurring and normalized for the period the fdics methodology was flawed and did not use the root cause of the issue which was low levels of fully loaded tangible capital caused by poor asset liability risk management decisions the final rule was disappointing as they ignored many thoughtful comment letters including our own they announced the public hearing subsequently canceled the public hearing before voted three two along partisan lines to adopt the final rule this continue the disconcerting trend of increasing partisanship in banking regulation the us is the only country that has allowed partisanship to invade the banking regulatory process banking is a noble profession were well aligned with our customers collaboration with our industry is necessary and a missing element today moving on we believe the strategic decisions and investment weve made this year have us wellpositioned for success in the longterm and our diverse operating model will continue to operate successfully in any market environment going forward turning to slide period end loan balances increased million or approximately linked quarter with growth in both ci and commercial real estate loan growth did slow in the fourth quarter but our teams remain confident in our pipelines as we move forward both period end and average deposits continue to grow this quarter our loantodeposit ratio was stable at remaining well below our peers and providing significant onbalance sheet liquidity to meet future loan or other liquidity demands bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 while our cost to deposits continue to increase this quarter the pace was less than half the level weve experienced the previous three quarters allowing our net interest margin to stabilize marty will comment more about net interest revenues but we believe we are very close to the trough our credit remains very strong and we have a combined reserve of million or of outstanding loans at quarterend which is considerably above the median of our peer group finally we repurchased  this quarter to reflect our longterm confidence in the company and to take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to him marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide period end loans were billion growing million or almost linked quarter total ci loans increased million or linked quarter with yearoveryear growth of million or commercial real estate loans grew million or linked quarter and have increased million or yearoveryear compared to december cre balances have grown at a modest annualized growth rate growth this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily properties with an increase of million and industrial facility loans with an increase of million this growth was partially offset by a decrease of million in office loans bringing the total office loan portfolio to its lowest point since the yearoveryear cre growth of million was also driven by multifamily and industrial loans and again partially offset by a decline in office loans we have an internal limit of of tier capital in reserve to total cre commitments and were presently at that limit is based on total commitments so we do have ample room for continued modest growth in outstanding cre balances as construction loans fund up as of december cre balances represented of total loans consistent with the prior quarter a ratio well below our peers combined services and general business loans our core ci loans increased million or with yearover year growth of million or these combined categories are of our total loan portfolio healthcare balances increased million or linked quarter and have grown million or year overyear primarily driven by our senior housing sector healthcare loans represented of total energy loan balances decreased million linked quarter and have increased million or yearoveryear with period end balances at of total period end loans yearoveryear loans have grown billion or excluding ppp loans  extends the linked quarter loan growth to nine consecutive quarters our current pipeline is strong and combined ci and cre commitments increased linked quarter we expect continued strong momentum to drive additional loan growth in turning to slide you can see that our credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio with credit metrics well below historical norms and prepandemic levels nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies increased million this quarter the resulting nonperforming assets to period end loans and repossessed assets did increase basis points to nonoccurring loans increased million linked quarter primarily driven by an increase in healthcare loans the increase is consistent with non accrual fluctuations in a narrow range experienced over the past two years with no indication of systemic issues committed criticized assets were of tier capital and reserves at yearend the second consecutive year below and the third below compared to an ratio prepandemic the provision for credit bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 losses of million in the fourth quarter reflects a stable economic forecast and continued loan growth as well as continued low net charge offs net charge offs were million or basis points annualized for the fourth quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months continuing the trend of performance far below our historical loss range of to basis points looking forward we expect net charge offs to remain below historical norms the markets continue to be focused on the office segment of real estate given the trends in workforce preferences our exposure to loans secured by office cre continues to decline as we intentionally manage that segment down now representing less than of our total loan portfolio our office maturities are generally ratable over the next three to four years and we have many firm options if the markets are not conducive to longterm financing the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend the reserve is sufficient to cover our nonperforming assets by times the total combined allowance is available for all losses and any applestoapples industry comparison should include the combined reserves we expect to maintain an appropriate reserve supporting loan growth and reflect audio gap conditions overall we remain in a solid credit position today with a stable economic outlook while our current credit metrics may be unsustainable in weaker economic environments we have a history of outperformance during past credit cycles and are wellpositioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million relatively consistent with the previous quarter however the previous quarter included recordhigh results for our wealth management segment with fourth quarters wealth results still representing their third highest fee income quarter ever trading fees increased million as sales activities related to our institutional customers continue to improve with some lift provided by our recent memphis expansion partially offset by a linked quarter decline in our mbs trading activities our bankwide investment banking activities fell million linked quarter as the third quarter benefited from a record quarter for wealth public and corporate finance group although down from their third quarter record high the public and corporate finance group recorded their largest single transaction in their history during the fourth quarter wealth management had a record year in achieving total revenue of million which eclipsed the prior record set in by million resulting in an annualized threeyear growth rate of this was driven by record revenue in the majority of our business units including corporate trust retirement plan and asset services private wealth customer hedging and investment banking transaction card revenue increased million and all other feegenerating categories remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous quarter demonstrating the consistent positive results we see from these business lines our assets under management or administration were billion at the end of the year including an asset mix of fixed income equities cash and alternatives our diverse mix of fee income continues to be a strategic differentiator for us and allows us to perform well in a variety of the economic bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 environments we consistently ranked in the top decile for fee income as a percentage of total net interest revenue and noninterest fee income our revenue mix has averaged during the last months with that ill turn the call over to marty martin e grunst chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you scott id like to start by describing a few of this quarters unusual items as some of them impact multiple line items the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business resulted in a onetime pretax gain of million which is included in the other gain net line item and income statement there were also two components of transaction related expenses recorded in nie million reflected in professional fees and services and included in personnel expense which produced a net gain of million we took advantage of that opportunity to reposition our available for sale portfolio resulting in pretax losses of million which is reported in the loss on available for sale securities line item the total million reported in the other gains net line item includes the million insurance sale gain as well as million of gain related to market value increases on deferred compensation assets which is effectively offset with million of increased personnel expense this quarter the fourth quarter also included million of accelerated recognition of tax expense as a result of exiting three low income housing tax credit investments without that item the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been turning to slide fourth quarter net interest revenue was million a million decrease linked quarter net interest margin was a basis point decrease compared to  this quarter reflected a significant easing of deposit pricing pressure compared to recent quarters interest bearing deposit costs increased basis points in the current quarter however this is the slowest pace we have realized since the federal reserve started raising fed funds rate in early our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta increased to for the fourth quarter dda as a percent of total deposits came down to as of december this slide shows net interest margin and net interest revenue with and without the impact of the trading business to better highlight trends and comparability for the fourth quarter net interest margin excluding the impact of trading assets was versus in the third quarter i expect to see a small decline in net interest margin going into  followed by relative stability after that growth in earning assets during the quarter was driven primarily by ci and cre loans turning to slide liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers total deposits grew million on a period end basis and the loantodeposit ratio decreased just slightly to this is stronger than our prepandemic level well below the median of our peer banks and positions us well for future loan growth average total deposits increased million linked quarter with average interest bearing deposits up billion partially offset by a million decline in demand deposits brokerage cds remained an insignificant amount of our funding and decreased slightly in the fourth quarter our tangible common equity ratio was up basis points due in large part to term interest rates falling late in the fourth quarter adjusted tce including the impact of unrealized losses on held to maturity securities is cet1 is and if adjusted for aoci would be we have sufficient capital to support continued organic growth and opportunistic share buyback with a high degree of certainty knowing that the recent regulatory capital proposal is primarily focused on banks over billion turning to slide linked quarter expenses increased million up driven primarily by the million fdic special assessment personnel expense grew million due to four primary factors regular bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 compensation increased million due to salaries related to business expansion and expenses related to the sale of the insurance business sales related activities led to a million increase in cash based incentive compensation deferred compensation expense which is driven by market valuations increased million linked quarter and lastly employee benefits increased million linked quarter due to seasonal increases in health insurance costs nonpersonnel operating expenses grew million excluding the increase in fdic insurance expense with million related to expenses on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business we also made a million contribution to bokf foundation in our continuing efforts to support the communities we serve turning to slide ill cover our expectations for we expect mid to upper singledigit annualized loan growth economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain favorable and continue to be supported by business inmigration from other markets the competitive environment for loans should be a tailwind for us we expect to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat and to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position we expect total deposits to grow modestly and loantodeposit ratio to remain near currently we are assuming no additional rate changes by the federal reserve in we believe the margin will migrate slightly lower in  of and expect net interest income to be near billion for full year in aggregate we expect total fees and commissions revenue in a range of million to million for excluding the fdic special assessment we expect expenses to increase at a mid singledigit growth rate as we continue to invest in strategic growth and technology initiatives with revenue growth following at a slight lag as revenue growth is realized in we expect the efficiency ratio to migrate downward to approximately our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality we expect nearterm provision expense to remain low and trend toward more normal credit costs in the second half of changes in the economic outlook will impact our provision expense additionally we expect to continue opportunistic share repurchase activity ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president ceo coo director bok financial corp thanks marty this quarter was a period on the end of the year with the second highest earnings bok financial has ever achieved as many banks struggled in the turbulent economic environment we proved once again that our strategically diverse revenue mix is built to withstand any storm while other banks may be pulling back we have positioned ourselves to be in a great liquidity and capital position to organically grow our business and perform very well in we have strong pipelines going into weve expanded our market reach our credit quality remains very strong and our fee income businesses are positioned for solid growth im very proud of the entire bok financial team that worked so hard to deliver these strong results with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning jon stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning jon jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey question for you marty this is the question ive had a few times this morning on your numbers just some banks are assuming zero rate cuts others are assuming two to four others are saying six what does your net interest income and margin outlook look like with a few cuts and then maybe as much as six cuts and i want to followup and ask on fees as well but maybe just net interest income first martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah thats a great question jon and yeah our exposure to rate declining is actually very small its actually de minimis but more importantly if you get the forward curve with four or six or cuts in that range that winds up with a steeper curve and thats actually better for us so in those scenarios where youve got the fed cutting this year might actually be marginally better for us jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so but and youre referring to the billion to guide so youre saying martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc if we get more cuts that could go higher okay good to hear and then i guess a question for scott as well if im assuming some of the fee guidance that youre giving us assumes flat rates what does lower what would lower shortterm rates do to some of your trading businesses and other fee income businesses bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp right so the two big beneficiaries of that decline would be in our mortgage entity itself with our mortgage originations in the mortgage group and then a pretty immediate increase in our mortgage trading our mbs activity both as they have historically with lower rates have outperformed significantly in those lower rate environments so we get significant benefit from both of that market backdrop if rates were to rise i mean to decrease im sorry jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay but you guys would actually welcome some cutting on the shortend stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp theres no doubt about that jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp i mean mortgages that performing very well for the environment but thats really at an alltime kind of low in terms of where were at from a production perspective and so any kind of movement downward in rates is really going to help that and then that correspondingly is also going to help create more inventory if you will for the mortgage trading aspect of our business as well jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp so that level of production and activity revenue generation on the institutional trading group has maintained that flattish level with the pickup in other categories so our municipal trading activity has offset the declines in the mbs but we would see that pick up in mbs which we think would give us a lift overall jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good ill step back but thank you guys i appreciate it stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you jon bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 operator our next question is from peter winter with da davidson please proceed peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp hi peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co i had a question on the morning stacy i had a question on the loan side can you just talk about borrower sentiment today versus days ago and then just if you could elaborate on that point that the competitive environment should be actually a tailwind for you guys marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah this is marc youre absolutely right about it being a tailwind for us given our situation with liquidity and capital position and solid credit quality we feel very comfortable that we are out pursuing loan opportunities across our footprint and across our all our lines of business and were trying to take advantage of some of the peer banks that are cutting back a little bit or pulling back for their various reasons so that is the effort that is the focus of all our sales teams and i dont think theres any particular area that were shying away from right now as far as borrower sentiment goes thats weve always been focused on customer selection so were going to be focused on ones that are wellpositioned to grow or to expand during this timeframe and well support those companies as we see appropriately stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp and peter the footprint gives us a lot of tailwind too when you about just the economic expansion thats happening in texas broadly the new market we opened with san antonio and austin phoenix is doing very very well denver is hanging in there really well so the footprints going to give us some tailwind there too just by having better economic growth in the footprint states and i think youre going to get that nationally as well i think the only real concern i have the risk to our guidance on loan growth really is commercial real estate theres some risk that as the year goes along we get a higher elevated level of payoffs which could mute the total loan growth a little bit but overall we feel very good about the guidance that we provided given our footprint peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you and then on credit marc you mentioned the healthcare could you just give a little bit more color about the million increase in healthcare nonperforming loans marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah i mean healthcare loans now account for of our overall loan portfolio and we have an occasional loan here or there that weve had good management support of inside it but things havent progressed as they bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 expected and we had to put those into more of a workout situation one of them is more of an ongoing senior housing one of them is more of a private pay situation so theyre not even in the same sides of the business its just we will have oneoff nonperforming credits like that it is not a reflection of anything we see systemic in the healthcare business and i guess if im to add anything if you look at our nonperforming loans over time they have operated for the last numerous quarters in a very narrow range and if we go back and look at some quarters its one of our other portfolios that adds to it if its another quarter its a different portfolio and this quarter just happened to be a couple of oneoff deals in healthcare and well address those and be able to manage that we believe ongoing in a very narrow range with low chargeoffs as weve had for a number of years now stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp just broadly i mean credit is a strength i mean if you look at where we are compared to prepandemic were not quite half in terms of our criticized and classified level nonperforming levels are strong i mean chargeoffs this quarter were million i mean its obviously not sustainable but i think where were positioned and where we have performed historically credit is very apparent that its a strength right now and i think as we look forward we still feel like in the guidance that marty provided we still feel pretty good that at least over the next couple of quarters we dont expect chargeoffs to be materially elevated peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks stacy appreciate it stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from ben gerlinger with citi please proceed ben gerlinger q analyst citi hi good morning stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning ben ben gerlinger q analyst citi i was curious the growth that looks pretty good are there a little bit better than i would have guessed but are you seeing people step back or risk adjusted spreads being a little bit more appropriate they are willing to lean into the growth just any color on rates youre getting as well stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 no i think generally speaking i mean it depends on what segment youre looking at from a spread perspective i would say on the larger corporate deals there isnt some spread enhancement thats coming as a result of maybe a liquidity premium in the marketplace that the larger banks are requiring from that perspective on the commercial banking on the lower end theres probably not a lot of spread enhancement thats happening there theres still more competition there part of it is mix as the mix shifts surround over time that can change our spreads just a little bit because there are higher spreads and the specialty lines of business than there are in traditional ci but i think what we saw is the fact that we are were not just open for business but were actively prospecting looking for new customers trying to use this opportunity to grow very thoughtfully is creating opportunities for us and really we had several deals that kind of pushed into the first quarter we were hopeful would have closed in the fourth quarter so were optimistic about our loan pipelines and what were hearing from our customers and prospects as we think about loan growth in ben gerlinger q analyst citi got you thats helpful color and then i know the trading businesses kind of the front end of the curve you need consistent spread cuts to really see that start to work or is it just kind of the implications any kind of thoughts on what you might expect in terms of a cadence of say the forward curve is correct martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp i think in the trading business even without changes in rates that business has momentum given the investments weve made in expanding into memphis et cetera and so it would be incremental on top of what we already expect to be a growth trend if we get forward curve plays out stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp ben were you talking about nir or the fee businesses ben gerlinger q analyst citi the fee business stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp yeah i think marty answered that as it relates to the fee businesses for sure ben gerlinger q analyst citi yeah thats helpful thank you guys stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you ben operator our next question is from matt olney with stephens inc please proceed bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 matt olney q analyst stephens inc hi great thanks good morning everybody stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp good morning matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc going back to the fee discussion and i think scott touched on this briefly with jons question but just take a step back and help us appreciate the drivers of that guidance for fees and commissions the various components of that through each one of your fee businesses i think that guidance implies like a high singledigit growth in what are the major drivers and detractors of that guidance martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah why dont i start on that matt so i think that the businesses that probably have the greatest opportunity are in the brokerage and trading where weve made investments there and weve got great momentum in that business fiduciary asset management i think well have customary growth in that business plus we think that asset valuations are going to give us a little bit of wind at our backs from an aum perspective and thatll flow through to growth rates and then mortgage actually has opportunity there both on the production side and on the servicing side and so we expect to see good numbers out of that line of business on a percentage growth perspective scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp matt this is scott i think that when you look at that total category as i mentioned earlier in the call the thing that were pleased about is the fact that were not seeing any one component carry the load if you look at multiple quarters now and the year as a whole were seeing heightened levels record levels of revenue generation across all the categories of wealth management which as you know is very well diversified both by product set customer set geographically where we serve international market and many of those operating units so its broadly across the board where weve seen investment historical investments in our corporate trust business and our asset management business the trading pieces as marty mentioned but all of those together and combined are what produces the result that gives us optimism that were not dependent upon those fed rate cuts to continue to see momentum and growth in the business lines no doubt if we see and its less about the rate its more about some steepness to the curve benefits the trading businesses because weve now been operating on a decade where we didnt have any slope to the curve which incents no one to go out so if we do see some steepness in the curve well see but i think were extremely well positioned if that were to shape out bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay appreciate the thoughts there scott and then i guess shifting back over to the rate sensitivity you provide some good commentary been relatively neutral as far as on the nii what are your early thoughts on deposit betas in a falling rate scenario whether its back half of the year or next year whenever that would be and how would those betas you think compare on the way down versus what we just saw on the way up at the bank martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so given the fact that over the last couple of quarters youve seen betas be higher youre going to see a mirror image of that more or less as we see rates come down in that kind of environment i mean as you know those are nonlinear and so youre not going to get the same exact beta at each rate hike but youll see relatively high betas on the way down given that youve got a lot of that betas on the driven upside was the larger corporate and wealth balances matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah okay fingers crossed and then just lastly on the expense side i know those expenses can be lumpy quartertoquarter i think you mentioned a few things that made it more little higher in the fourth quarter and i see the fullyear guidance but any color on where we could start off with earlier in the year in the first quarter on the expense side martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah if you take the fourth quarter number the million and then adjust that for the fdic special assessment you get to million number so coming out of the gate next quarter wed expect to be a little below that stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp as marty pointed out matt i think its important theres some bokfi transaction costs that are embedded in some of those line items in the fourth quarter particularly related to personnel expense and professional fees that you got to think about too is really being part of that sale of that business not really part of the core run rate of the company martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so if you think through some of those unusual items and filter some of those out youll get taxes on wages coming up in the first quarter but that will net down to just a little bit low matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks everybody bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you matt operator our next question is from will jones with kbw please proceed william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great good morning guys stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning will william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey marty i was just hoping you could help us unpack the margin story what it looks like in both this flat rate environment that your guidance is predicated off of and then maybe what the margin does if we do see two or three or four even six rate cuts this coming year i know you talked about compression next quarter but then maybe a stable nim in this in a flat rate environment but can you see expansion in that scenario and then i guess just confirm well certainly see nim expansion if we do get rate cuts thanks martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so the basic trajectory that were expecting is margins basically level out a little bit down in the first quarter level and then actually just a little bit up at the end of the year is how we think about it for a flat rate scenario of course plus or minus the usual drivers of noise around that trend and then if you got a forward curve kind of scenario playing out thatd be modestly supportive of the margin percentage in those later quarters when that would play out once the steepness would start to play out william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got you thats helpful and then where do you think we are in the noninterest bearing remix story i know the balances took another step down this quarter but did you feel like were getting close to kind of leveling out there or how do you think about noninterest bearing deposits into this year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah the decline we saw in the fourth quarter was largely as we expected when we talked about at on our  call so for the first quarter we do expect another decline thats a little smaller than what we saw in the fourth bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 quarter but still pretty sizeable pretty close to that size just as you get a combination of some of the rate driven moves and some seasonal declines that are normal for us in as we go into  so youll see  down another step and then after that our expectation is much smaller amounts of shift from noninterest bearing into interest bearing for the next couple of quarters as we just get into the tail phase of that as that naturally plays out william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for that and it feels like maybe its been a while since those updated thoughts on bank ma it feels like there could be some pushes and pulls on ma into the coming year could you just update us on how you feel or how you generally think about ma and in terms of and market transactions or out of market or size just any kind of context you could give would be great stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp yeah so two factors i think i do think rates are going to have to come down before bank ma becomes more realistic you still have purchase accounting issues that are going to happen until some of the securities portfolios and banks that would like to be acquired are better positioned thats going to create some headwind there until thats resolved i think for us broadly a large bank acquisition is going to be difficult for us to do theres just not a lot that would fit the profile that were looking for we would want to stay largely in the geographic footprint that were in today we really like that we want to continue to grow particularly in these fast growing markets like texas and continue to invest there its got to be of sufficient size to move the needle for us but theres just not a lot that fit that were more interested in technology or product acquisitions that could add on and be incremental much quicker and not distract the whole company from regulatory approval and conversion process and so i would put the odd that we find the whole bank acquisition in the next months to be pretty low and we are continuing to look for things on the product or technology side that could be accretive to us and valuable to us long term although theres nothing on the horizon there either william jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay excellent thats it for me great year guys stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from timur braziler with wells fargo securities please proceed timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc starting on the deposit side do you have what the deposit spot rate was at the end of the year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah we dont really have a deposit spot rate per se but our cumulative beta was for the quarter and for the month of december is so really not a lot different than the full quarter average timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then looking at expenses and trying to take into consideration some of the comments around what happens on the fee income side if we do get rate cuts is the expectation that the expenses grow in an environment where you see some higher revenues from fees and if that is the case is the efficiency ratio in a down rate environment still a good base or could you actually see some improvement as some of these fee income businesses pick up some more momentum martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp id say broadly speaking the is good but you could see some incremental improvement from just a higher revenue lift overall because that would just accelerate that trend stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp if you think about mortgage particularly i mean mortgage is probably running plus efficiency today so if you got any lift there youre going get a better efficiency ratio out of that line of business so marty is right i think were very comfortable with the forward guidance we provided there but any benefit that we get from a lower rate environment should be incrementally positive to our efficiency ratio timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from brandon king with truist securities please proceed brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah so i want to followup on trading nir and what are you expecting kind of implied in your nii forecast and if you can kind of give us the puts and takes on how that could play out just given fed rate cuts potentially occurring in the year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so in our guide were just assuming that that remains roughly constant throughout the year to the extent that you get some steepening that could be a positive for that line item for sure brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and then i just want to followup on credit so in your guidance you expect the increase in credit costs more towards the later part of and then you also mentioned kind of a normalized range of to basis points so is it fair to assume that maybe back half of we approach that basis points of net charge offs is that how youre thinking about it stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp no i think we were were talking about our guidance its really around provision levels not charge off levels i do think you could see just based on some reversion you could see charge off levels come up a little bit in the back half of the year but marc talked a little bit about our historical charge offs we always guide to to basis points but its been a long time since weve seen basis points marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah i mean if weve been looking back over our history we have been below basis points of net charge offs since it was the last year we hit basis points so weve operated mainly between less than to for the last to years so right now given where our credit is we dont see the increased level of net charge offs coming but as we grow and as the economic environment changes that will have the impact on the provision that we have to have and the reserve we have to have and were going to keep make sure we continue to make that appropriate level of that reserve reflecting those two things but its going to be driven by those more than its going to be driven by net charge offs brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay very helpful thanks for the details operator we have reached the end
