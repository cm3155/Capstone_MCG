second quarter press release are available on our website at bokfcom we refer you to the disclaimers on slide as it pertains to any forwardlooking statements we make during the call ill now turn the call over to steve bradshaw steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of financial results we are pleased to report a record quarter for bok financial in terms of preprovision net revenue despite the many economic challenges due to covid19 shown on slide second quarter net income was million or per diluted share thats up from last quarter despite another quarter of elevated provision for credit losses earnings this quarter were bolstered dramatically by million in revenues from our fee businesses as our wealth management and mortgage teams have continued their momentum to post simultaneous record quarters for the company focusing on preprovision net revenue its clear to see the significant benefit we drive for our company with our longterm commitment to balance revenue and breadth of business capabilities preprovision net revenue was million this quarter the highest level in the history of our company considering the environment we find ourselves in today this is truly a remarkable outcome that all of our highperforming and talented employees should be proud of fees and commissions revenue was up nearly from the previous quarter and an incredible quarterly yearoveryear on continued strong wealth management and mortgage revenues fee revenue now represents of total revenue and thats up from in the same quarter a year ago this once again demonstrates an important differentiating characteristic of bok financial we have long had a diverse revenue mix that provides an earnings buffer in economic downturns because of the countercyclical nature of some of these fee revenue streams expense management remains prudent with an efficiency ratio of below for the quarter even with the shift in the mix of revenue towards fee income it should also be noted that we added million in unplanned contribution to our foundation including an incremental million in the second quarter to aid those in our communities with food insecurity while providing much needed jobs for displaced restaurant workers our loan loss provision was million this quarter due to a combination of changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables along with some credit migration that marc will cover in more detail momentarily while we continue to build a reserve again this quarter we believe the material reserve build should be largely complete assuming our economic forecast is in line going forward net interest revenue was up million to million this quarter despite the ongoing impact of a basis points of emergency rate cuts in march our ability to decrease deposit costs and the relatively elevated nature of libor early in the quarter helped preserve a large portion of our margin steven will cover the underlying components in more detail later in the call turning to slide average loans increased billion to eclipse billion this quarter while this was positive for the company overall billion of this was due to small business administrations ppp program average deposits were up nearly linked quarter and up nearly from the same quarter a year ago bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 we attribute the strong growth to continued momentum in deposit gathering activities along with ppp loan deposits and government stimulus payments even with the significant growth in deposits we were able to bring overall interestbearing cost down from basis points last quarter to basis points this quarter as we were able to adjust rates paid on interestbearing deposits due to our proactive management in the face of an unprecedented fed movement in the first quarter assets under management or in custody were up nearly this quarter on strong sales efforts and increases in the equity markets during the quarter we believe asset growth is in part attributable to the volatility in the markets which has really underscored the value that a professional advisor brings to individual and corporate investors during times of extreme uncertainty ill provide additional perspective on the results at the conclusion of the prepared remarks but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio in more detail ill turn the call over to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp thanks steve as you can see on slide period end loans were billion up billion for the quarter ppp loans added billion to the portfolio so that we did see growth in some of our specialty areas net of ppp broad pay downs across our core commercial and industrial loan book actually contracted the portfolio this quarter some of this was repayment of more defensive draws in the first quarter and some of this was due to the organic decline and economic activity energy loans contracted for the quarter as commodity prices made new deals difficult to source in the current environment energy borrowers are paying down debt to reduce leverage at this point in the cycle energy commitments were down million from the first quarter of and million since the end of the year these commitment declines are a direct result of redetermination of borrowing basis that occurred during the second quarter despite these factors we remain open for business and continue to support our customers in the energy industry energy lending is core to our dna and our experience in previous commodity cycles proved that this is a profitable business when approached in a consistent and disciplined manner this business is more than just lending activity as evidenced by the record quarter we had of million in energy derivatives revenue this quarter as customers continue to aggressively manage their commodity risk this longterm view has served us well and today we remain wellpositioned in the industry with a complete service offering worldclass energy bankers and enviable customer base we continue to see great opportunity for our energy franchise over the next several years as other banks have retransform this space entirely or in part marc will cover the credit specifics of the energy portfolio momentarily but as we said in the past we believe the duration of the oil price decline is the more significant factor affecting performance than the level of prices our healthcare sector loan balances increased million to billion or nearly for the quarter primarily due to growth in balances from our hospital system clients who demonstrate a strong credit profile this quiet segment has been impacted due to deferrals of elective procedures as well as the need to increase the inventory of supplies and protective equipment that said the cares act has multiple revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage due to the risk of the virus this has benefited multiple clients and is expected to help bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 mitigate the credit risk in the healthcare portfolio while it is still early thus far we have not realized any material credit migration or deterioration in this portfolio commercial real estate loan balances were up from the previous quarter largely due to the lowest level of paydowns we have seen in many years as a result of friction in the permanent financing market while ppp loans did help stimulate overall loan growth in the second quarter our outlines for loan growth for the rest of the year will largely be determined by the speed and shape of the broader economic recovery ill turn the call over to marc maun to discuss our credit metrics marc marc c maun chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide weve again compiled a list of loan segments we consider more exposed to the economic impact of the pandemic as you can see the exposure to the entertainment and recreation which includes gaming in our native american specialty portfolio that boasts a strong credit profile retail hotels churches airline travel and higher education that are dependent on large social gatherings to remain profitable today is less than of our total portfolio this group of loans is highly diversified with over loans for an average loan size of less than million some of these clients have participated in the paycheck protection program which has provided some measure of relief well obviously continue monitoring these exposures closely in the coming months credit quality has remained manageable but there has been some migration of nonaccrual and potential problem loans given the current economic environment primarily in our energy portfolio that led to a larger provision for credit losses in the second quarter slide details our provision actions this quarter the total provision was million with million related to lending activities changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables primarily due to the anticipated impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic another assumption required a provision of million all other changes totaled million which included million primarily due to increased specific impairment of energy loans and portfolio changes of million primarily due to changes in risk grades related to energy loans the million was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in loan balances and net charge offs of million bringing net portfolio change adjustments to million for the quarter the provision related to lending activities was partially offset by a million decrease in the accrual for expected credit losses for mortgage banking activities our base case reasonable and supportable forecast includes an increase in gdp and an civilian unemployment rate in the third quarter of as adjusted for the impact of government stimulus programs our forward 12month forecast through the second quarter of assumes a increase in gdp and an civilian unemployment rate wti oil prices are projected to generally follow the nymex forward curve that existed at the end of june per barrel for delivery in the third quarter of and increasing to per barrel in the second quarter of our downside reasonable and supportable forecast reflects a more severe and prolonged disruption in economic activity than the base case and includes a increase in gdp and a adjusted civilian unemployment rate in bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 the third quarter our forward 12month forecast through the second quarter of assumes a increase in gdp and a adjusted civilian unemployment rate wti oil prices are projected to range from per barrel for delivery in the third quarter of to per barrel for delivery in the second quarter of turning to slide nonaccruing loans increased million this quarter primarily due to a million increase in nonaccruing energy loans and a million increase in nonaccruing services loans as we have said before we believe the risk of migration to potential problem and nonaccruing status outweighs the risk of loss in the energy portfolio potential problem loans totaled million at quarter end up from million at march this increase largely comes from the energy portfolio as the recent oil price decline coupled with the capital markets environment requiring certain customers to work through their liquidity needs weighed on some energy borrowers commodity prices particularly oil prices remain depressed throughout most of the second quarter but recovered somewhat in june as we noted last quarter if prices remain depressed as we went through the spring borrowing base redetermination process we would expect continued credit quality issues in this portfolio we realize this migration as we completed most of our redeterminations in april and may prices have improved since but do remain fragile and closely tied to the continued economic recovery should current price levels hold into the fall we would anticipate positive credit quality migration in this portfolio the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at june excluding ppp loans the allowance for loan losses was of outstanding loan and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was fiscal stimulus has had a positive effect on credit quality through ppp loans sba support and other cares act programs that said we received a number of deferral of forbearance requests early in the quarter but very few new ones after april all requests were evaluated on a casebycase basis and we have granted billion in forbearance requests from customers as of june including million or about of commercial loans primarily in the small business and healthcare portfolios million or roughly of the commercial real estate loan and million or roughly of loans to individuals we are just starting to reach the expiration of the first days and to date over of the deferred loans are going back to regular payment while retail commercial real estate does account for over of our commercial real estate deferrals we have not experienced any material credit issues todate primarily due to stimulus programs clearly the retail portion of this portfolio is the most vulnerable to sustained stayathome and shelter inplace directives as with oil the lost content in retail will closely correlate with the duration of the various governmental orders and adjustments in consumer behavior after these orders are lifted while office and multifamily will see impacts here we believe our geographic footprint will help us in these segments in the longterm because of the strong in migration over time shortterm quality migration in commercial real estate will be dependent on economic recovery and the impact of fiscal stimulus ill turn the call over to scott grauer to cover the wealth management fee revenue contribution this quarter scott scott bradley grauer evpwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 thanks marc on slide youll see the highlights of the wealth management division second quarter financial results as our investors know wealth management is a business that weve been committed to for over a century at bok financial with a broad crosssection of products and services including institutional and personal wealth management trust services for individuals and corporations and institutions private banking services retail and institutional brokerage investment banking and financial risk management as well as a few others wealth management revenue was up to million from the previous quarter and up quarterly year overyear this is inclusive of the fee income lines that investors see in our corporate income statement brokerage and trading in fiduciary asset management but it also includes net interest income from loans and deposits in our private wealth group in our trading portfolio bokf continued its growth in hedging pipeline risk and providing liquidity to mortgage originators strengthening its position as a market leader and a marketmaker in that space overall mortgage issuance increases driven by lower rates as the fed stepped in to provide market stability and gse policy changes around forbearance created an opportunity for bokf to provide greater liquidity to the housing market during a period of record volumes increasing the trading portfolio by and driving a record quarter in our trading and derivatives business total brokerage and trading revenues generated in the wealth management division were up from the same quarter a year ago eclipsing million the majority of this was derived from mortgagerelated trading activity with second quarter total mbstba tradingrelated revenue of million thats a increase over linked quarter and a increase from the same quarter a year ago net direct contribution which is operating income before corporate allocations was up a robust for the quarter this was a result of careful expense management as total operating expenses for the division before corporate allocations were up only compared to last quarter and up from the same quarter a year ago despite the outsized revenue growth this translated into significant and meaningful earnings leverage for the division on the net interest revenue side wealth management loans were up slightly and deposits were up respectively this quarter a testament to our ability to be additive in a multitude of ways to the company in fact wealth management deposits now represent of total company deposits as our efforts there have expanded relative to the rest of the company perhaps most importantly the stage is set for continued growth in the wealth management division in the short term lower interest rates and the resulting stimulation of the mortgage industry bodes well for continued performance in our brokerage and trading segment longer term the retirement of the baby boomers and the transfer of nearly trillion of wealth to their heirs is one of the most powerful demographic trends facing the wealth management industry we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit with a diverse set of products and services to meet the needs of the next generation ill now turn the call over to steven nell steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks scott as noted on slide net interest income for the quarter was million up nearly million from the first quarter though million of that was attributable to ppp loan activity net interest margin was compared to in the previous quarter the extreme reduction in deposit costs of basis points all bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 the way down to basis points libor spread remaining elevated early in the second quarter and the strategic positioning of our balance sheet had combined to reduce the pressure on margin this quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans net interest margin was compared to in the previous quarter a testament to the steps weve taken average earning assets increased billion over the last quarter and average loan balances increased billion largely due to the influx of ppp loans in the second quarter available for sale securities increased million as we have adjusted our balance sheet for the current rate environment fair value ops and securities held as an economic hedge of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased billion in addition receivables from unsettled security sales primarily related to our mortgagebacked trading operations increased billion growth in average earning assets and noninterestbearing receivables was largely funded by billion increase in interestbearing deposits more than billion of ppp loans outstanding at quarter end were funded through the federal reserves ppp liquidity facility on slide fees and commissions were million an increase of nearly from last quarter and an increase of quarterly yearoveryear this was fueled largely by strength in our brokerage and trading business that scott just covered but also a record quarter from our mortgage banking activities mortgage banking saw a significant surge in production revenue this quarter growing million or more than relative to last quarter and almost from the same quarter a year ago while volumes were up it was the increase in gain on sale margins of basis points compared to last quarter that drove the strength today the industry is against capacity constraints which is easing pricing competition and growing margins refinances represented of total originations as low rates drove much of the demand while we see the second quarter as peak seasonality in this space we fully expect to be able to capture our share of the purchase and refinance activity as long as the opportunities persist service charges decreased million largely due to the shelter in place impacts coupled with proactive waivers of fees that were extended as a courtesy to our customers during the pandemic another success story of the quarter relates to the hedging of our mortgage servicing rights this quarter the net msr activity results in a million benefit due to the combination of positive net hedging results modest assumption updates and an economic benefit from the sale of approximately billion in unpaid principal balance of our outoffootprint ginnie mae servicing rights an impressive outcome as the rate environment remains volatile many of our fee businesses are clearly driving the overall success story of the company once again highlighting the significance of the revenue diversity that we have turning to slide total operating expenses increased million to million personnel expense increased million for the quarter largely due to a million increase in incentivebased compensation split between cashbased and deferred compensation the cashbased portion of million resulted from increased trading and mortgage activity and million of deferred compensation largely related to the overall equity market recovery this recognition of deferred compensation expense is offset by an million gain on related deferred compensation assets resulting a no earnings impact for the quarter other components included an increase in regular compensation of million and a seasonal payroll tax decrease and employee benefits of million nonpersonnel expense was up million for the quarter mortgage banking costs increased million with million due to msr amortization expense and million due to changes in our portfolio and loan counts delinquency levels and additional accruals relating to bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 losses on loans in forbearance occupancy and equipment expense increased million due to the impairment of two leases we also made a charitable contribution of million to the bokf foundation in the second quarter these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in business promotion cost largely related to reduced travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the pandemic our liquidity position remains very strong given the exceptional inflow of deposit balances our loan to deposit ratio is now compared to at march providing significant onbalance sheet liquidity to meet future customer needs additionally we have billion of secured borrowing capacity and over billion of unsecured and contingent liquidity capacities to support liquidity needs of the company our capital levels remained strong with a common equity tier ratio of an improvement from last quarter and well ahead of our internal operating range minimums and a full basis points above regulatory minimums our internal stress test have given us confidence to support our customer base and to maintain our current level of dividends although we have no set plans or commitments to buy back stock in the near term our capital levels would allow for that opportunity currently we dont feel the need to supplement holding company or bank level capital with any capital raising actions due to the continued uncertainty around the severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the broader economy its difficult to provide specific guidance that weve done in more normal times but ill give you a few comments on slide that might be helpful our loan growth is expected to be soft for the foreseeable future most energy deals will likely not be done at current prices many healthcare opportunities will remain on hold due to the pandemic and little activity will be present in our cre and ci portfolios we will continue to originate mortgage loans very limited amount ending up in our permanent portfolio our available for sale securities portfolio which is largely agency mortgagebacked securities yielded during the second quarter given the sustained low rate environment prepayments could reach over million per quarter we expect to reinvest those cash flows at current rates around basis points to basis points as we noted we had success during the second quarter driving deposit costs down significantly we feel theres a bit more room to reduce deposit costs that likely will not drift much below basis points which is comparable to our deposit cost low watermark during the last nearzero rate environment the combination of pressure of asset yields and little room to lower deposit costs will put some pressure on net interest margin in the next quarter our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall earnings pressure being felt in our spread businesses we expect our brokerage and trading activity to continue at elevated levels given our products and capabilities in the mortgagebacked trading space our mortgage origination and servicing business should remain solid but will likely slow some as refinance opportunities abate and seasonality trends slow as the year progresses our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and nonpersonnel costs will continue we have no plans to reduce staffing or cut existing capabilities or products as youve seen with bokf and most other banks significant loan loss reserve building has taken place during the first and second quarter although there remains much uncertainty in the economic environment we believe loan loss reserve building is largely behind us as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength well maintain our current level of quarterly cash dividends and well evaluate share buyback as the year continues bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven our success this quarter is a result of a longterm strategy to serve clients in a holistic way with a benefit to shareholders of less earnings volatility and enhanced risk mitigation as we do not feel any temptation to reach for growth by extending risk in any of our lending businesses those who have been with us for a while can think back to the last interest rate cycle where most financial institutions saw their earnings opportunities compressed with net interest revenue at that time as it does today bok financial outperformed with a unique heavily feebased business model that benefited our shareholders through that challenging environment while no two downturns are the same there are clearly several bright spots proving out of bokf today namely in our wealth management and our mortgage businesses that said the most significant opportunity going forward will be the return to full economic activity in a safe manner across the nation ultimately we thrive when our clients and our communities do so our expectations remain tempered as the path to a healthier macro environment comes into focus until that time we will continue to do everything we can to assist our customers regardless of the speed and shape of the economic recovery achieving more together is a phrase you will often hear at bokf and that couldnt be more true today when covid19 began to threaten our communities we stood together taking difficult steps to reduce the risk of infection for our clients and each other being together apart does have its own set of challenges but we continue to learn from our virtual experience and we are indiscernible shape how we will manage aspects of our business going forward im just as proud of the resiliency i see in the individuals across our organization as i am of the financial outcomes it is generating our strategy and our people at bok financial are clearly different than most similarsized peers and i think that our ability to compete effectively with the national banks and investment firms is a significant factor in the results weve produced this quarter with that were pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question is coming from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning ken stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess maybe just sort of a broad question about energy i know when the whole pandemic started you guys served me some cautious commentary just about obviously the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic could lead to some pretty serious losses if it were to continue its been three months since your last earnings release like how has the trends in the energy industry performed versus kind of your expectations at the beginning of the cycle thanks stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp sure ken this is stacy i think from our perspective the recovery has been swifter than we would have anticipated when it began i think the market and i think including us didnt forecast the level of shutin production and things that would happen to curtail supply in this environment we saw a very strong response from the industry when prices declined so precipitously and so the industry has always been selfhealing and we talk about that it usually takes months to months to kind of find a new equilibrium price but certainly the price recovery that weve seen in the last days or so particularly in oil has been very encouraging and certainly we feel much much better about future loss potential at these price levels than what we were on the strip average not on the spot but on the strip average were or so per barrel higher today than we were when we had our earnings call last quarter and that makes a big difference in terms of our outlook and what we see as potential loss content there i think marc alluded in his comments to the fact that if prices stay here we would expect to see positive credit outcomes from a credit migration perspective as we move into the third and the fourth quarter recall that we dont downgrade the whole portfolio when prices move we do that as we touch them through the semiannual redetermination process and those prices were not great prices when we were going through the redetermination but much in the same way we dont upgrade the entire portfolio when there is a price recovery bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 so as we touch those credits in the late third and into the fourth quarter if prices hold at these levels we would expect to see very positive migration in that book ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great perfect and then just a second question you added a line in your press release that it looks like you of your deposit growth well it says billion was related to cares act funding i think you had billion of ppp loans can you just clarify that did you access the federal governments facility to fund the ppp loans was that part of the deposit growth steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp ken this is steven no that was just an inflow both from ppp as well as all other kind of cares act initiatives that generated that deposit growth so it was not just ppp but it was other cares act stimulus that flowed into our customers accounts so we went through and tried to find out how much of our billion of deposit growth was related to either cares or other stimulus programs and came up with roughly billion of that growth was from those areas the rest of it was just regular kind of growth from our core customer base ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i see okay so if the ppp loans payoff and or lets just say ppp plus loans payoff then maybe billion of that funding might go away or that deposits go away but then youre saying the other call it roughly billion of deposits is just core deposits that might be more sustainable over time steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats correct ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you very much for the questions operator thank you our next question is coming from gary tenner of d a davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning everybody marc i appreciate the color on the economic outlook i think in the slide deck it noted kind of the build was based on three scenarios i think you highlighted two could you i assume the third is that a further adverse scenario or is that a kind of upward scenario and maybe could you tell us the weightings between the three scenarios that you used marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp sure the base case scenarios when we highlighted there we weighted at we also run an upside case and a downside case that weighted each those at thats similar weighting to what we had in the first quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 again the economy is moving so quickly and changing so rapidly that we felt that kind of that base even weighting across those scenarios of helped reflect kind of that potential volatility gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you and then as youre thinking about recognizing the fee side of the ppp loans and what youve got embedded in the net interest revenue this quarter from that was that just based on a month average life or have you made any other adjustments in terms of assuming a shorter average life for revenue recognition purposes steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp so yeah this is steve and youre correct we felt there was about million i believe benefit in our net interest income from ppp split well not split but roughly million or a little bit more was the fee recognition side and another million or so just in net interest income from ppp loans we have it weighted as those loans begin to get forgiven out more in the fourth quarter than any other period so youll see additional in the third but then more in the fourth quarter as we think a lot of those will begin to get into forgiveness status and then therell be a tail of it as those loans stay on the books out for months so weve got it staged out that way gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co all right thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with fee income i mean another new record this quarter after another record last quarter but it sounds like i mean from your commentary it sounds like brokerage and trading could remain at this level mortgage could come down some but it sounds like fee income will remain at close to this elevated level for the rest of the year is that the right way to think about the strength in fee income bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp scott why dont you take the brokerage and trading piece then i can make some comments about mortgage scott bradley grauer a evpwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp okay sure so this is scott grauer in terms of wealth management a couple of reasons we feel confident about the momentum and really beyond even the mortgagebacked securities volume and activity which was obviously very strong in both the first and second quarter and we look to maintain robust levels there both on our tba hedging activity as well as just the overall volumes inside of the mortgagebacked securities product mix but weve got good momentum and have had solid results in our financial institutions group which offers both taxable and tax exempt securities across the spectrum to downstream banks as banks look to position their securities portfolios with a little bit of a waning loan demand so that activity has been very strong in terms of our corporate trust business and our retirement plans business weve seen very good activity and pretty good pipelines in fact in our defaulted debt space and our corporate trust piece where we typically have handled one or two recognizable names we today have eight defaulted debt assignments so that presents good opportunities for us our investment banking activity in the second quarter was very strong both on the municipal piece financial advisory and underwriting as well as our corporate deals where we had a surprisingly high number of capital market transactions for energy names so when you look at just the overall trust fees we really went from a period of decline if you looked at from end of to the end of march and then on into april trust fee revenue rate had declined about from peak to the bottom and weve now recaptured that and are back on yearend trust fees overall beginning in june so we feel like weve got pretty good activity and a reason to be confident about sustaining the momentum steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp so brady on the mortgage side weve had two quarters in a row now with mortgage production volumes over a billion i think the difference this quarter was the margin the gain on sale margin improved from basis points in the first quarter to basis points in the second quarter so thats what drove the majority of that increase in mortgage revenue and were going to be strong there i think on out through the year but i do think theres some seasonality there when you look at the second quarter also being refi i think those refis are not going to last forever i mean i think that abate some over time so even though i think mortgage is going to stay strong im cautious to say it it hits the same level that it hit in the second quarter because of the outsized margins the rest of the fee businesses look pretty good i mean if you look at the transfund network and their activity theyre soft as a contributor i think for the next several quarters relative to our other businesses over time but our fee businesses are going to be a pretty significant contributor i think for the next several quarters relative to our other businesses in the bank brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 all right thats helpful and then lastly for me if you look at potential problem loans theyre up a pretty notable amount in the quarter i think they went from roughly million to about million and i think you guys call out energy as one of the big drivers but any other color on the increase in potential problem loans in the quarter marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well this is marc todate it really has been energy driven the borrowing base redetermination season was in the primarily in april and may which was at the low point for oil prices and so that was what caused the migration in those potential problem loans which we hope as stacy mentioned earlier prices stay where they are that that will migrate positively as we go into the fall todate we have not seen any significant migration in other portfolios weve had nothing that i would call outsized relative to what you would see in a normal cycle we are monitoring our portfolios across the board have done a lot more deep dives into areas that where we consider higher risk and were focused on those and so were monitoring closely and evaluate them as they go forward but we havent seen any significant migration yet stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and i would expect to see that improve much like the commodity price improvement that weve seen thats also that potential problem loan bucket is where we put those revolving credits in energy that have gone through bankruptcy but the revolver is generally okay but its the sub debt or the capital markets unsecured debt that is being kind of cleansed and equitized weve used that potential problem loan bucket to kind of park those as they go through that process so as those begin to emerge there could be some positive credit migration that would come out of there from that perspective as well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question is coming from jennifer demba of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey this is brandon king on for jennifer steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hey brandon brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey i noticed that your impacted areas table that churches and colleges are mentioned and i wanted to know if you had any color on what was going on as far as trends in these portfolios steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 as far as todate on those portfolios we havent seen any significant issues on the colleges and universities side of it of course were in the summer were waiting to see how they the plans that the various universities make with regards to reopening and bringing students back but were ph in visiting with those we feel like were in good shape on those loans today but were closely monitoring them on the churches it is a broad based portfolio of a lot of smaller loans so weve had two or three loans that weve had some issues with but overall we havent seen any migration yet but thats a much broader base theres not a substantial large loans in that portfolio they tend to be pretty small so we feel pretty comfortable that we can manage that risk associated with that portfolio brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks and just additionally of the impacted areas which of the areas are you seeing the most stress and what areas are you seeing the least stress marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well if id just be selective on that i think the least stress is probably in the casino piece of that those are with almost theyre all exclusively native american and tribal casinos i think of our outstandings are covered by cash thats available at either of the casinos itself or the tribes so while they have shut down completely for a couple of months theyre starting to reopen we feel pretty comfortable based on the liquidity of the tribes and so forth there was very few ppp loan requests associated with the casinos or loan deferrals associated with the casinos so that has probably performed in a positive manner we have a small hotel portfolio that we acquired as a result of our cobiz acquisition because thats not an area that we pursue or had ever pursued actively that portfolio its pretty small but it is probably going to be the most challenged portfolio of the loans that are identified on that slide brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc all right thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question coming from us jon arfstrom rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of cleanup followup questions i guess this on the energy npls stacy or marc can you just talk about the characteristics of the increase that maybe obvious but give us an idea of whats in there marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well what happens or i guess ill put it this way the increase in the nonperformings were done primarily from the borrowing base redetermination process we went through in april and may when our price deck as stacy noted was to less so based on that when were discounting back the cash flow the level of collateral support was below in some cases what the loan level was and would need to be a deficiency that would need to be addressed the overall quality of the collateral base was strong enough that we were covered and dont expect didnt expect significant amounts of loss but it did create a stress situation for those borrowers and so that resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans now if we as we go forward the great thing about the energy lending portfolio is we get to resize our loans we get to reassess the loans every six months based on the current price deck so if we were looking at these loans in the fall we anticipate that theyll migrate more positively because we have a significant increase in the price availability i mean its important to note that were not relying on drilling to get repaid we are reliant on the production of the existing borrowing base or the existing collaterals at the given price levels and ill add one more thing to this i think its important to get this out is that we have a significant amount of hedging in our portfolio it continues to be very strong of our oil commitments are hedged at greater than at for the rest of and are hedged more than at throughout so the hedging profile of both our oil and gas portfolios is going to help sustain them through this process as the economy reopens and the price deck improves jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay indiscernible stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp youve got an allowance there for energy thats 44pluspercent thats well above what it was during the last cycle at the peak and our view is that were trying to address this now through cecl proactively so you kind of get this all reserved for we evaluate every one of those npls for any impairment as we look at those so i think the perspective is we reserve for that well continue to evaluate circumstances but we think that were well reserved and adequately reserved for that portfolio as we move forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 okay good thats all helpful and i it kind of follows the next question i have two more but i tried to put ph abate into my loan loss provision line in my model and it didnt work so i need a little bit of help defining what ph abate means in terms of reserve building are you saying it was meant to be funny by the way but are you saying that you do expect to build reserves somewhat youre not expecting very much loss content and obviously youve sent a pretty clear message on loan balances so is the message expect a pretty heavy retreat in the provision from here marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp i wouldnt i dont steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp go ahead marc marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah i wont say that we will have a heavy retreat what i would suggest is that if we have cecl is designed to bring reserve build earlier in the cycle the economic forecasts that have been put out and plus the way weve looked at our own portfolio has resulted in a pretty strong reserve build to this point in time if our base case forecast would play out we would not need additional reserve build that doesnt mean that we would start to reduce that unless we saw improving credit quality or not see the increase in credit deterioration that might accompany should depending on how things play out in the economy we feel very good about the energy portfolio we still stimulus packages have helped support retail and some of the covidimpacted industries and we need to see how those play out over the next several quarters but i would say if it does play out in the in maybe into you might see us have the opportunity to look at that reserve level stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp jon we define reserve build as provision greater than chargeoffs and its certainly dependent on what we see from a credit migration as this virus unfolds what were trying to foreshadow there is we do think the significant provision in reserve building that we experienced in the first and second quarter is largely behind us and as we move forward we would be more responsive to actual chargeoff levels than continuing to try to build the reserve if our economic forecast holds jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay i may followup on that but it just did it feels to me like with your potential problems potentially coming down youre really not signaling a lot of stress in credit from here as the way im reading it but i can follow up on that but last one is on the buyback what would you guys need to have the courage is too strong of a word but the comfort or courage to think about restarting the repurchase program thats all i have thanks steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 well this is steven i think what i would say is that we think that the price is attractive and well have to see what the environment looks like we have substantial capital im really happy with our capital position it actually grew this quarter so im not making any specific commitment to buy back or not buy back but i do think its something that we discuss opportunistically here at the bank and well make a decision but its not necessarily off the table like youve seen a lot of banks announce no more buybacks for the year i just were not going to be in that position well evaluate it as time goes across the year and could very well buy back some shares jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp just no firm commitment jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right good thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from jared shaw of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler for jared steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hi timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc id like to just followup on the credit question from the prior caller it looked like the allowance build this quarter was quite sensitive to credit migration and from all the commentary that youre saying it seems like a combination of the improved pricing along with other things is theres going to be some potentially meaningful positive credit migration in as early as the third quarter i guess what would prevent that same level of sensitivity of allowance coming off as migration improves in the coming quarters versus allowing to build when migration worsened in the second quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i mean i think thats the nature of cecl and our models build in a factor for risk grade migration which we had and as marc and stacy pointed out when we did our borrowing base determinations thats when we determined the risk grade of those energy customers and we saw a migration negative and that feeds into our probability of loss or our probability of default calculations in our cecl model bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 so to your point if we get improvement in those grades in the third or fourth quarter when we redo the borrowing basis at that time hopefully at these prices that have come back substantially and in june then we would expect risk grade migration back the other direction which would clearly have a very positive impact on our cecl calculation and the nature of that calculation is if we feel theres reserves that need to come off then well pull those well pull the reserves off we just have to see where that lands in the third and fourth quarter but thats the way we understand it works timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then just last one for me there is a statement in the release talking about repurchasing loans from ginnie mae when certain delinquency criteria is met is that mandatory when certain criteria is met you have to repurchase them back from those pools or is that at your discretion and i guess any kind of color you could provide around that would be helpful steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah its not mandatory its our discretion but you lose indiscernible you basically have controls since you can purchase them back so you bring them back on your balance sheet but it just grosses up the balance sheet so you dont actually purchase them but you bring the loans back and then you have an offsetting liability on the other side so its not mandatory but we have in the past purchased some of those for real and had gain some advantage of that over time but thats the way the accounting works there timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator our next question is coming from gary tenner of da davidson please proceed with your followup gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks i just had one quick followup in terms of billion of the covid19 impact area loans on slide what amount of those have been under a forbearance or modification since this pandemic started marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah this is marc what amount has been under deferral weve actually had our deferral amount is about of our total loans but of the loans that are in that slide actually received ppp as opposed to asking for deferrals so we havent had any significant increase in deferrals on that particular slide relative to any other part of the portfolio because they were primary beneficiary from ppp and that caused a number of them not to take deferrals gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay the slide says ppp loans to those categories are million versus the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp correct gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co billion so thats about marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp correct of those loans
