thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials first quarter financial results starting on slide first quarter net income was million or per diluted share a million decline from last quarter the first quarter ushered in dramatic changes in the economic and geopolitical environment resulting in extreme interest rate volatility this volatility negatively impacted our mortgagerelated businesses especially our mortgage trading activities on a pretax basis our net contribution from our institutional trading group decreased million linked quarter demand for lower coupon us government agency residential mortgagebacked securities was constrained as investors reacted to interest rate volatility and market uncertainty interest rate volatility also negatively impacted outcomes in our mortgage servicing rights hedging results creating a million pretax decline in performance compared to the fourth quarter finally the other material component driving the linkedquarter decline was the million pretax reserve release recognized last quarter the most impressive story for this quarter has been the loan growth experienced excluding ppp loans our core loan portfolio increased million or linked quarter the credit quality of our loan book continues to be outstanding we determined the current reserve for loan losses was appropriate therefore no reserve release this quarter continued strength in commodity prices and improved credit metrics were sufficient to offset this quarters loan growth and changes in the economic outlook our forecast for gdp growth and unemployment while consistent with prepandemic levels are tempered compared to the prior quarter turning to slide total loans grew million or linked quarter but that is net of an additional million in ppp loan forgiveness during the first quarter core ci loan balances are up annualized ci commitments grew as well with relatively no change in the core utilization rate which positions us well with plenty of growth capacity as the economy continues to rebound as expected our commercial real estate group returned a positive growth this quarter with periodend commercial real estate balances increasing million loans attributed to our wealth segment were materially consistent with the fourth quarter average deposits increased million this quarter however period balances were down billion we experienced a significant seasonal inflow of deposits during the fourth quarter in our commercial and wealth business lines with over of that increase off the balance sheet by the end of the first quarter compared to march periodend balances are now billion or higher than last year assets under management or in custody in our wealth management fell slightly this quarter down to billion more than half of that change was market valuedriven compared to march assets under management or in custody are up billion or almost ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion linked quarter increase of million that represents the largest linkedquarter balance increase since the first quarter of total ci loans grew million or linked quarter with growth largely from general ci and energy bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 as expected the payoff trend in real estate abated resulting in commercial real estate growth of million or linked quarter loans to individuals contracted million linked quarter with most of the decline from the resale of loans previously sold into ginnie mae mortgage pools that the company repurchased when certain delinquency criteria were met we continued to see loans repurchased during the pandemic being cured and meeting the resale qualifications loans in the energy space recorded backtoback quarters with periodend outstandings increasing million in the first quarter following last quarters million increase commitments grew slightly less than outstandings this quarter so utilization levels increased but remain low compared to prepandemic levels a return to those utilization levels on our existing customer base would provide an additional million in outstanding balances ancillary business from customer hedging investment banking and treasury for this segment set another new record for fee revenue this quarter topping last quarters previous high with linkedquarter growth just below healthcare balances also increased up million or linked quarter primarily driven by our acute care and specialty hospital sector healthcare line utilization levels were consistent with last quarter looking forward we remain very confident in our ability to perform from both a growth and credit standpoint in our healthcare portfolio as it remains a leader for us excluding energy and healthcare core middle market ci realized positive growth again this quarter with linked quarter growth of million or ci utilization levels continued to run at historic lows but increased slightly this quarter given such low utilization levels we still have significant capacity to increase outstanding loan balances as demand continues to come back online without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition a return to more normal utilization levels organically adds about million of core ci loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty areas based on fourth quarter lending trends we were optimistic heading into the first quarter and the results did not disappoint we remain confident in our ability to produce solid growth throughout the remainder of this year were optimistic that the payoff trend weve experienced since the fourth quarter of in commercial real estate balances has finally turned this quarter as periodend balances grew million or linked quarter industrial multifamily and office were segments driving this quarters results we expect these balances to continue to grow throughout the year as we have plenty of capital allocated for this space to grow in and beyond ppp loan balance forgiveness was million this quarter reducing outstandings to only million of the remaining ppp balances less than million or are of the vintage we continue to work with our clients through the forgiveness process and expect any future remaining balances to be minimal we believe we can leverage the momentum weve experienced in the first quarter and extend that trend to produce a more normal loan growth cycle as we move through turning to slide you can see that as we move further out from the pandemic credit quality continues to improve significantly we continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio and excluding loans guaranteed by us government agencies nonperforming assets fell million linked quarter to million over the last months nonperforming assets are down million or overall asset quality is better than prepandemic levels our overall credit quality metrics combined with continued strength in commodity prices as well as an outlook for moderate growth in gdp and labor markets provided a favorable offset to the significant loan growth realized this bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 quarter so that no increase in the reserve for loan losses was required we realized net chargeoffs of million for the first quarter and the increase of million compared to only in net recoveries for the fourth quarter excluding ppp loans net chargeoffs have dropped to an average of basis points over the past four trailing quarters which is below our historic loss range as we look forward to the next quarter we expect net chargeoffs will continue to be at or below the lower end of our historical range excluding ppp loans the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans and unfunded commitments at quarterend having come through the pandemic the allowance is now migrating towards our post cecl level of back in early first quarter nonaccruing loans decreased million from last quarter primarily due to a reduction in nonaccruing general business and energy loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarterend down from million on december potential problem energy commercial real estate and service loans all decreased compared to the prior quarter with that ill now turn the call over to scott grauer scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the first quarter a million decline from the fourth quarter as stacy noted earlier the first quarter experienced a disruption of fixed income markets caused from a combination of factors such as rising inflation the recent federal funds rate increase expectations of future increases as well as the conflict in ukraine these events dramatically altered the mbs trading environment which reduced demand for our shortduration lowcoupon us government agency residual mortgagebacked securities the result was a million linkedquarter decline in the pretax contribution from our institutional trading group apart from the institutional trading activity all other brokerage and trading revenues were down million linked quarter primarily due to the record fourth quarter we experienced in syndication deals within our commercial segment which are irregular in nature regarding our mbs trading activities we expect the balance sheet usage to moderate through the next several quarters as the mortgage origination market reacts to higher interest rates and continued shortage of housing supply trading volumes and related revenues will react to those market conditions with margins expected to remain under pressure fiduciary and asset management fees were relatively flat linked quarter but up compared to the same quarter a year ago despite a decrease from market valuations assets under management finished the quarter at billion down just linked quarter compared to this time last year assets under management have grown billion or while weve seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances over the past year sales activity remain strong in this space as well our current mix of assets under management is fixed income equities cash and alternatives our relationshipdriven business model is perfectly in touch with clients needs today as we move forward in this new phase of market volatility for example our cavanal hill investment management mutual funds were recently ranked number on barrons best fund families of this is out of asset managers in the lipper database we believe the confidence and appreciation for financial advice weve earned during the pandemic from institutions and individuals positions us well to serve our clients in this period of market uncertainty bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 transaction card revenue decreased linked quarter with seasonal factors impacting the linkedquarter comparison compared to the first quarter of card revenues are up this is largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of the us economy deposit service charges increased this quarter with growth equally spread between our commercial and consumer segments compared to the first quarter last year total service charges have grown million or approximately of deposit service charge fee in the first quarter were consumerrelated nsf fees we continue to monitor the current regulatory environment in this space evaluating various alternatives to arrive at our strategy going forward mortgage banking revenue decreased million or linked quarter primarily due to lower production volumes combined with narrowing margins mortgage production volume decreased million to million as the industry continues to face not only housing inventory constraints but rising mortgage rates as well other revenue declined million or linked quarter primarily as a result of lower domestic letter of credit fees and reduced repossession revenues ill now turn the call over to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you scott turning to slide first quarter net interest revenue was million an million decline from last quarter that was primarily due to an million linkedquarter decline in loan fees with million of that decline directly related to ppp fee recognition business line nonuse fees fell million linked quarter largely due to higher utilization levels the fourth quarter also had the seasonal benefit of million in fees from the sale of transferable tax credits which largely occur in the fourth quarter each year interest on our trading securities fell million as the effective yield decreased basis points linked quarter the decline in trading securities interest income was materially offset with increased interest on our available for sale securities portfolio as the average yield on those securities increased basis points average earning assets decreased million compared to last quarter primarily due to the million decline in the trading securities portfolio used to support our brokerage and trading business average loans increased million linked quarter excluding the million linkedquarter decline in ppp loans average balances increased million interestbearing cash decreased million average total deposits grew million with noninterestbearing balances up million and interestbearing balances up million this quarter net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter with the decrease materially driven by the linkedquarter decrease in loan fees excluding loan fees core loan yields increased basis points as we began to benefit from rising shortterm interest rates our average costs of interestbearing deposits held flat for the quarter at basis points we believe the core margin is at a low point we saw increased yields on our available for sale securities portfolio and our loan portfolio this quarter as shortterm rates begin to move higher our current assetsensitive position has us poised to benefit as we expect the fed to aggressively move shortterm rates higher throughout bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 turning to slide ill briefly highlight our current levels of asset sensitivity which we discussed in detail last quarter we continue to maintain an assetsensitive balance sheet position and expect our performance in a rising rate environment to be similar to that experienced during the last rate hike cycle from to using our standard modeling assuming a parallel shift up basis points gradually over months net interest revenue would increase or approximately million over the following months the total benefit increase is or million with a flatter yield curve expected versus a parallel shift up our estimates for up basis points would be approximately half those levels ill provide more color in a moment when i talk about our specific forward guidance for net interest income on slide you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio increased to this quarter from at december due to the combined impact of a billion decrease in total deposits and a million increase in loan balances this quarter our significant onbalance sheet liquidity leaves us very wellpositioned to meet future increasing customer loan demand our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well above regulatory thresholds with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market turning to slide linkedquarter total expenses decreased million primarily due to decreased personnel expense this quarter and a million contribution to our foundation last quarter personnel expense decreased million linked quarter with cashbased incentive compensation down million from elevated levels in the fourth quarter deferred compensation expense which is largely offset by a decrease in the value of related investments included in other gains and losses net decreased million sharebased incentive compensation decreased million resulting from changes investing assumptions relative to performance versus our peer group these decreases were partially offset by a million net increase in employee benefits expense due to a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan costs partially offset with a seasonal decrease in medical expense costs regular compensation expense continues to run fairly flat as it has for the last four quarters we expect to continue to manage personnel costs effectively going forward but realized that inflation and the tight labor market pose a risk nonpersonnel expense decreased million this quarter with million of that from the fourth quarter contribution to the foundation most expense categories had similar spend levels for both quarters the exception being increased occupancy and equipment which was offset with declines in professional fees and recruiting expenses on slide ill provide guidance in a few key areas for the remainder of loan growth gained momentum this quarter as we expected and we continue to see solid overall loan pipelines and improvement in line utilization both of which support an overall pointtopoint growth in the upper singledigit range we expect growth to come from all of our regional markets and continued growth in our wealth division with much higher interest rates likely during than originally assumed we expect some declines in deposit balances deposits could decline pointtopoint midsingle digits by the end of the year however even with accelerating loan growth and some deposit runoff our liquidity position is expected to remain strong bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 modeling a basis point interest rate increase for the remainder of and taking into consideration the flatness of the forward curve deposit beta assumptions similar to previous rate cycles loan growth guidance and holding the available for sale securities portfolio flat we expect an increase in yearoveryear core net interest income of which excludes million of ppp revenue differential between the two years based on the modeling just described our net interest margins should migrate close to by the end of the year the expected increase in market interest rates has and will have a significant negative impact on our mortgage and brokerage and trading activities on the other hand increasing interest rate improves a portion of our money management and fiduciary fees given the market uncertainty i will provide guidance for our individual diversified fee revenue line items but i will say that in total fee revenues could dip slightly below of total revenues at least for given the dropoff in fee revenues and related variable expenses our goal is to maintain total operating expenses relatively flat for our current loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances is we expect that percentage to migrate towards by the end of very close to day one seasonal levels we expect to continue opportunistic quarterly share repurchases within the total dollar ranges spent over the past several quarters ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven the overall results this quarter did not meet our expectations as the market experienced extraordinary interest rate volatility the markets had to digest high levels of inflation changing sentiment around the magnitude of interest rate hikes and the first meaningful geopolitical conflict in europe since world war ii our mortgagefocused business lines were materially impacted as the markets appeared to reset apart from that reset our core operating business model performed well this quarter as we move forward we believe we are wellpositioned for this new environment we have strong momentum growing our loan portfolio with both actual results and loan pipeline strong weve been intentional about positioning our balance sheet to benefit from rising interest rates with evidence this quarter as core loans and available for sale securities yields improved as federal reserve moves aggressively to increase shortterm interest rates we will see expanding margins and revenue credit quality has long been a differentiator for bok financial and we are wellpositioned should the credit markets begin to show weakness though there is no sign of that today we operate in a fastgrowing regional footprint that we expect to provide stronger growth than the national economy over time looking ahead im excited about the outlook for bok financial with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just starting quickly with the guidance and the rate assumptions do you have any major change to your deposit beta assumptions sort of from the end of last year as we look out over that updated guidance steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp a little bit so the first basis points i think would be very similar to what we guided in the first quarter and then obviously the second basis points it rises i think close to a beta kind of on average for the year is whats in our model jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc so sort of at the end of the basis points cumulative beta steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp correct jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on the securities portfolio the afs portfolio whats duration at march and what you expect for monthly cash flow from that steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 yeah so the effective duration is about years i believe and we are receiving in most rate environments about billion annually from cash flow so you can do the math there by quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on the loan growth side i appreciated the detail on a normalized utilization rate and what that could do to balances what is the for the loan growth are you assuming that you get back to full normal utilization rate to get that growth or if you did would there still be additional upside marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp well this is marc maun were not necessarily assuming were going to get back to full utilization growth weve had our commitment stay at a very stable level and utilization has been only up very slightly so a lot of the growth has come from new customer acquisition we expect to continue to gain new customers throughout the year and expect if we get benefit from increased utilization that will help our overall growth rate jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great thanks and then finally i guess just for me on deposit fees any thoughts of changing sort of policy or procedure on nsf and other retail deposit fees or is that something thats potentially further down the road stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp sure jared this is stacy we continue to look at that we have about million a quarter in consumerrelated nsf fees and we continue to take a really hard look at that over time and i think you can expect over time that line item for consumer will have some pressure on it in terms of getting smaller but as a relative percent of our fee revenue its a very very small percent so its something we think we can replace over time we did introduce a new deposit product this quarter a bank loan product that doesnt have the overdraft fees associated with it and were watching to see the adoption of that too which could also impact that line item but we see as you do the regulatory pressure on that its not a big line item for us weve done weve previously made other changes ahead of this so we feel were well positioned there but therell be pressure on that item going forward jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks for the thanks for the color operator our next question comes from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you obviously you can see the benefits of the diversity of the business model but im just wondering with the pressure on fee income this year do you think you can get positive operating leverage this year or maybe in the back half of this year stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp the efficiency ratio we certainly expect to improve as the year goes along and if you think about i mean that was the kind of the point i think thats important here as we shift from weve had a great two years of fee business on the trading and on the mortgage side and really we benefited from that disproportionate to other regional banks because of that investment weve made in the fee businesses but as the market shifts to a more net interest revenue generated and more difficult for some of those mortgagerelated businesses thats a more efficient revenue stream for the company and so we believe you will see a shift to more positive operating leverage and a lower efficiency ratio as we get to the end of the year peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats helpful and then i saw that you reduced the size of the trading portfolio im just wondering how you think about that going forward will that continue to shrink scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah this is scott grauer so we as we sit today that size of the mortgagebacked securities trading portfolio weve reduced it as of today over from our high watermark and so as the size of that portfolio we clearly feel like weve reduced the where we had basis point exposure to this point so we feel good about the size of our activity and our portfolio that weve got in place today so we think that given a moderation in some of the volatility and the uncertainty in the markets we feel good about where were at today with that stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp so peter think about it like inventory i mean really that will accordion based on sales activity so to the extent that theres lower sales activity then that trading portfolio will get smaller and to the extent that theres accelerated trading activity it could grow but generally speaking were probably pretty close to where well be there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and just my final question stacy youve had a long career at bok but as the new ceo are there certain areas that you might be more focused on versus where steve bradshaw was or is it kind of just business as usual bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp well i think its unlikely you picked the guy whos been at the company for years if youre looking to make dramatic changes i think the changes that youll see from us really are more reflective of the changing environment weve come through two years of pandemic and is the first kind of postpandemic year so were awfully focused on top line revenue growth visibility with our clients being in front and visible being in their offices being active calling top line revenue growth is our number one priority for this year and thats really just a function of a different sales environment that were coming into after really tough couple of years from a sales perspective you can sell deeper into an existing relationship virtually and weve done that successfully but its hard to bring new relationships across if you dont have a previous relationship and so we think thats the opportunity and youre seeing the early fruits of that i think here in but our sales teams are very active theyre in front of customers and were seeing the benefit of that peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking the questions operator our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hi jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey there scott or steven can you help us deconstruct the brokerage and trading line a bit just so we kind of understand whats going on underneath obviously you talked about a loss before but just help us understand whats underneath that scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp so really it relates to the basis point exposure that we had in our mortgagebacked securities when we saw our run rate of trading activity for mortgagebacked securities and as we went into the fourth quarter as activities slowed particularly at the very end of the year they had some pickup in the first couple of weeks of january but then as an apparent accelerated move from the fed we had inflation numbers energy costs energy level spikes and then ukraine that activity halted and so our inventory as stacy mentioned was appropriate given our volume and activity rates coming up to that point and so as we saw activity muted with uncertainty in the marketplace that basis point risk we decided we wanted to reduce that exposure and we did so and we feel like weve addressed it and believed its largely behind us at this point bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp but jon if you think about the line items that typically make up that whether its investmentmaking revenue on the syndication side retail brokerage energy derivatives trading those other core areas were very solid this quarter or very strong it really was the kind of what we call the mortgage trading activity that drove that revenue category down but the other elements of that line item were good this quarter were seeing exceptionally strong activity from our energy customers wishing to hedge in this environment which our brokerage has been very stable and investment banking revenue was down a little bit in the first quarter but its seasonably down so we have really strong syndication pipelines and expect that the second and third quarter are going to be very strong for that category jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc but the big delta is that was that a million number i guess im just trying to get back to what you think is a normal steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah and frankly it wasnt million i mean it was slightly below million but we put million certainly in the 8k because we still had open positions there we still have a view there that we did know what the market would do and i wanted to make sure that we cover kind of what the downside there would be but we did not end up booking indiscernible of losses there it was lower jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats what i was looking for and then steven on slide on your disclosure i just want to make sure i understand it the second scenario the up basis points ramp months to that assumes basis points up from the first months and then through was i dont know what the term residual without any further indiscernible steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well yeah the second year so you go up along the way the first through months and then you stay at up basis points parallel for the next year and thats the kind of net interest income or revenue you would pick up from that scenario on a parallel shift and so im trying to highlight that there is a forward curve thats flatter than a parallel shift and that does cut into that number some if the forward curve and the flatness of the curve were to play out thats kind of how you have to interpret that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah but its the second steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yes the second full year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc like in months or more steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp of going up that full basis points and then it stays at that level thats the kind of pickup you would have that second year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and then maybe marc or stacy just the comment on commercial real estate and just kind of the permanent market alternatives easing a bit do you view that as permanent or temporary and if you could comment a little bit on overall cre expectations with higher rates stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah what i would say about with commercial real estate theres always inherent lumpiness from quarter to quarter but i always kind of looked at commercial real estate over a 12month continuum because you may have outsized growth in one quarter and outsized paydowns in another quarter but i think the more extreme paydown headwind that we saw is largely behind us i think that was really a function of the pandemic and kind of the kind of economic freeze if you will that happened so you had a lot that was eligible to move to the permanent market it did well still have and we got a healthy portfolio so youre still going to have things that move there over time but disproportionate to new activity i think it would be much more stable moving forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning steven thank you for all the detailed fundamental guidance for its really helpful in terms of the loan loss reserve probably going back down to around basis points do you feel like thats the biggest risk in the guidance youve given given we dont know exactly how the macro environment is going to turn out over the next several quarters with all these rate hikes and the geopolitical risk marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah jennifer this is marc no i dont think that thats a significant risk for us in terms of the guidance simply because were starting from a level right now that is probably the best weve seen since pregreat recession not bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 just prepandemic in terms of our asset quality and if we experience a loan growth it will help us balance out that loan growth by managing that reserve to that so i think the loan growth will support that decline as well as asset quality and whether it results in provisions will depend a lot on that loan growth number jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks so much appreciate it operator our next question comes from bradley sic brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah its brady good morning guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to clarify on the trading portfolio so in total on average point of view that went from billion last quarter to about billion this quarter and if you look at it in the period it finished a little under billion so are you guys saying kind of on a goforward basis that volume should be kind of flat to kind of where it exited the quarter at around billion scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp well i think this is scott i think as stacy mentioned thats going to be really more representative of the opportunity in the market and where flows are at and where volumes from a just a client activity standpoint is and we really have seen tremendous just lethargy in the market in terms of people willing to commit anywhere on the curve as weve had such uncertainty about the speed and the magnitude that the fed moves coupled with all the other macroeconomic factors so im not suggesting that its going to stay at that level its going to be reflective of just the overall demand of our customers set in the marketplace and our mix is already reflected reflecting some shift as weve seen the emergence of a little bit of yield availability with taxexempt and municipal yields pressing through taxable equivalents so were seeing higher demand and better activity in other segments of the fixed income markets just not specifically in the mortgagebacked securities area brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i think i heard you guys say your prereleased the million loss there but that actually came in less than a quarter what was the actual loss there for bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp page in the press release highlights i think it was million brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then finally theres another oklahoma bank a lot smaller than you guys put in their conference call last night they mentioned how esg was really driving a lot of the capital providers for the energy sector away and that they were seeing better terms they were seeing better rates it was actually a great time to get involved more actively in energy lending are you all seeing that dynamic with esg pushing some people away and maybe now is a great time to get more involved in the energy business and potentially grow that portfolio for you guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah this is stacy i think clearly our performance through the last really two cycles over the last six years has differentiated us and i think that we are seeing that we had new customer deals in the first quarter alone in in we were third in the league tables and energy deals that we led were deal size less than million so it was ph bofa it was jpmorgan wells fargo and it was bok financial in the first quarter we were second in the league tables for deals that we ran in the energy space so we are seeing opportunity there obviously they have a lot of cash flow so theres some of that new deal flow theyve got a lot of cash flow and may not need debt to drill with but we are seeing growth there and were seeing really strong opportunities and real meaningful recognition of our consistency in this space we havent gone in and got out based on the environment we understand it and were in it in good times and bad times brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then just one last one stacy back to my previous question so the trading loss you said was million which was on the first page of the release it looks like brokerage and trading revenue decreased ph about million so is that are we talking about the same thing steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp a little bit different he did quote the million decrease in brokerage and trading part of that has other items in it like the investment banking revenue mentioned earlier the real loss or the loss we took on those particular bonds was a little less than million scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp and again i think to stevens point that is on specific securities that we identified at those levels so when you look at the aggregate of the activity that it was clearly less than that when you look at the total for the quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah were really kind of isolating the bonds bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp were isolating those securities and those bonds that we were interested in indicating we had negative market movement from steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp exactly thats right brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks for the color guys scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp so if you look at the rollup of institutional trading and sales then that number was a negative million for the entire first quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator our next question is from gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning everybody stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hello gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co just wanted to ask another followup on energy two straight quarters of growth in that book of business theres been talk as to whether or not kind of the spike up in commodity prices with the situation in ukraine would drive any increased activity here are you actually seeing increased activity or is the kind of two quarters or this quarters growth not demonstrably driven by that given that you had growth in the fourth quarter as well marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp i think its a combination of new drilling activity and also theres some return of capital expectations given the high prices a number of the ownership in these various companies is looking to return a little bit of capital on their investment so that combination i think as it goes as time passes though and they need to drill to maintain their level of collateral and reserves well see increased activity as the year moves along and so that we think bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 will help us grow over time this portfolio throughout this year and as long as prices hold and demand holds where we expect it to stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp keep in mind rig counts nationally are below where they were prepandemic still even at these prices so now production levels are more closer to that prepandemic level but actual rig counts are below that so we think that particularly if they can hedge into this in two or three years board at prices that are or higher i mean frankly gas prices are extremely high right now natural gas prices so if they can hedge forward at these levels i think youll see more drilling activity in the latter half of the year but a lot of our growth has been new customer acquisition and deal flow from that but drilling activity is to come and thats part of the upside i think gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you and then a followup for steven in terms of the rate sensitivity and deposit beta outlook given how accelerated this tightening cycle is likely to be and what were going to see in the second quarter and third quarter do you think that the kind of cumulative beta is kind of in the numbers pretty rapidly before the end of the year and then just sort of a modest maybe bleed up in funding costs in or do you think its going to be a you all be able to hold those betas down on the front end steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think for the first basis points clearly we can hold them down i do think they accelerate some on the second basis point increase i think you average that together its about but the second piece of that is i think theres a kind of an inflection point a bit at basis points up where youll see more activity and youll see us half the price up a bit more but overall i feel like we can hold for this basis point move that we expect around that 30mark for the average beta across the whole different product set gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp the other piece of that that we havent spent a lot of time talking about is on our money management area there will be some benefit from rising rates on the fee side because weve been waiving fees about scott million a quarter scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp right stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 and as we scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp waiving or not receiving stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah waiving or not receiving so thatll be to our benefit once weve moved up about basis points and so thats a benefit as we move forward to probably youll see fully reflected in the third quarter but some benefit in the second quarter too scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah and then that also has just an aggregate benefit on total auma given that cash accounts for at quarterend of our total asset allocation dollars of our billion in aum gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah operator operator instructions our next question comes from matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning guys i want to circle back to the trading securities portfolio thats on the balance sheet i think it was around of earning assets in the first quarter i guess in the period close to billion suggests its closer to about of earning assets by late just trying to appreciate steven now on the nii guidance what youre assuming for that trading securities portfolio steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp its at a similar level here than what it ended the quarter i dont think we had a rising indiscernible its back to these guys discussion around the inventory and the opportunity but i think we hold it relatively close to where we ended the quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp as we looked at our modeling going forward for the rest of the year it could be better and so who knows but thats kind of what we used bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 matt olney q analyst stephens inc and i guess and ill follow up to that on the guidance for the year steven what does it assume for the overall average earning assets for the year steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i havent i dont have that in front of me but if you look at the loan growth guidance that we gave which is the upper singledigits you hold afs flat you hold the trading securities pretty flat and then you take a look at the funding side which the mix doesnt change that much although we do model in a slight decline in deposits before the end of the year thats the inputs into the models that generate the nii guidance that i gave matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay okay and i guess going back to the trading inventory help me think about how thats been funded on the liability side the last two years and i guess with the expected average balance contraction of the trading inventory what does that mean on the other side of the balance sheet steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well its a combination of all of our funding sources i mean we dont isolate one to the other necessarily weve been so flush with liquidity that you dont have to isolate and say this one part of the balance sheet is funded by x thats the way i think about it anyway matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and just lastly i think now you mentioned there were still some open trading positions back in march when you disclosed the 8k are there still any open positions that could generate incremental losses from here steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i mean theres always that possibility we do have some of those securities that we were dealing with in the first quarter we still have an inventory of those but like scott mentioned weve sold over of that basket of securities and in fact through now we sold even more so yeah i mean there are some securities that would have that opportunity but we dont see that we dont expect that to happen stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp given the reduction in inventory and the mark that we took any future change would likely not be material as we move forward i mean certainly nothing in the neighborhood of the magnitude that you saw in the first quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from ph taylor broderick with the hub group please proceed with your question q thanks just a couple of highlevel ones for me on fiduciary and asset management just down but obviously equity markets softer i didnt know if there was any other color about customer acquisitions or just increased assets per customer flowing in that maybe soften that decline this quarter scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah this is scott so in the first quarter we actually saw our net reduction in our auma was a result of market value movement and reduction we actually saw good sales activity really across the entire spectrum so our we feel good about our fiduciary assets safekeeping assets brokerage assets under administration and weve seen strong pipelines and very good results from a new asset acquisition across the board so its really reflective of market adjustments in terms of the decline q great and you might have touched on this earlier but on the buyback just obviously what anything changes given where the share price is now and capital still in really good shape or is there maybe more of a inclination to keep that for other organic opportunities steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no i think you can youll see us in the market at the price level were currently at relative to what we bought in the previous couple of quarters i think the dollar amount well use for buyback will be very similar to kind of the average that youve seen the past year that kind of fits our capital allocation towards buybacks and so you should expect us to be in the market q great thank you very much scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp sure operator we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session id now like to turn the call back over to steven nell for closing comments bok
