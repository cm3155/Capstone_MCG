quarter net income was million or per diluted share our team had another solid quarter of earnings driven by our diverse business model which prudently balances interest revenue with noninterest bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 revenues and allows us to perform well in a variety of business climates fee and commission revenues were of total revenue for the quarter this quarter our public and corporate finance group established new record for investment banking fees which materially offset last quarters recordhigh derivative fees additionally we continue to focus on opportunities for growth given the economic vitality of our core geographic footprint as we take advantage of our capital and liquidity strengths total loans have increased almost from last year and our core commercial and industrial loans were up we are poised to introduce our fullservice banking model into the san antonio market with the addition of a fixed income sales and trading office in memphis we are confident both will drive longterm shareholder value turning to slide periodend loan balances increased million or linked quarter with growth in both ci and commercial real estate both periodend and average deposits continued to grow during the quarter our loantodeposit ratio increased just slightly to at the end of the quarter as loan growth outpaced deposit growth our cost for deposits did increase linked quarter however the pace did slow as marty will detail later our reported net interest margin continues to be diluted by the expanding trading activity this quarter with our core margin excluding the trading activity at although it will take a few quarters to become clear we are seeing early signs of loan spreads increasing in our footprint as credit tightens and deposit costs remain high the pressure on our net interest margin from increased funding cost resulted in a million linked quarter decline in net interest revenue resulting in an efficiency ratio above which is more typical for us given the mix of non interest revenue credit quality is still strong and we have a combined reserve of million or of outstanding loans at quarterend which is notably above the median of our peer group finally we repurchased  this quarter to reflect our longterm confidence in the company and attractive repurchase valuations ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to him marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans were billion up linked quarter total ci loans increased million or linked quarter with yearoveryear growth of billion or commercial real estate loans increased million or linked quarter and have increased million or yearover year compared to december cre balances have grown at a modest annualized growth with commitments up during that same period growth this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily properties with an increase of million or linked quarter industrial facility loans grew million or linked quarter which was offset by a million or linked quarter decline in loans secured by office facilities the million in outstanding office loans is at its lowest point since june and is only of total outstanding loan balances the yearoveryear cre growth of million was predominantly driven by multifamily and industrial loans we have an internal limit of of tier capital and reserve to total cre commitment and were presently at the upper end of that limit we do expect continued modest growth in outstanding cre balances as construction loans fund up as of september cre balances represented of total outstanding loan balances a ratio well below our peers bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 combined services and general business loans our core ci loans increased million or linked quarter with yearoveryear growth of million or these combined categories are of our total loan portfolio healthcare balances increased million or linked quarter and have grown million or year overyear primarily driven by our senior housing sector healthcare sector loans represented of total loans at quarterend energy balances decreased million linked quarter and have increased million or yearoveryear with periodend balances at of total periodend loans yearoveryear loans have grown billion or excluding ph triple b loans  extends the linked quarter loan growth to eight consecutive quarters our current pipeline is strong and were confident we have momentum to drive additional growth in the loan portfolio well into next year turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio and well below historical norms and prepandemic levels nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies decreased million this quarter nonaccruing loans decreased million linked quarter primarily driven by a decrease in commercial real estate loans the provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter reflects strong asset quality continued loan growth and modest changes in our economic forecasts we remain in a solid credit position today with a ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate that is substantially less than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles we believe we are well positioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead the markets continue to be focused on the office segment of real estate given the trends in workforce preferences although the verdict is still out as to whether that will be sustained as the pendulum seems to be shifting back to more time in the physical office our office segment maturities are generally ratable over the next three years to four years and we have a ph miniperm option if the markets are not conducive to long term permanent financing the average loantovalue ratio in the office space is below and average cash flow coverage exceeds times based on our most recent review at the end of net chargeoffs were million or basis points annualized for the third quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months far below our historic loss ph range of basis points to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to remain low the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend the total combined allowance is available for losses and any applestoapples industry comparison should include the combined reserves we expect this ratio to remain stable as loan growth continues and economic conditions persist ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the third quarter down slightly linked quarter our wealth segment continues to set new quarterly highs for fees and commissions at million this quarter eclipsing the previous highs set last quarter fees and commissions for the second bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 quarter included record results for energy customer hedging as well as annual tax service fees although energy hedging customer and tax service fees were down linked quarter these were partially offset by record results this quarter in our public and corporate finance groups driving a million increase in other investment banking fees the million linked quarter decline in trading fees was primarily related to fees from our municipal bond trading portfolio down million linked quarter which was influenced by a rising interest rate environment and evolving market expectations during the third quarter this was partially offset by a million increase in our mbs trading activities fiduciary and asset management fees were million for the third quarter a linked quarter decrease due to the second quarters annual tax service fees our assets under management or administration were billion at quarterend our asset mix for assets under management or administration moved slightly this quarter with fixed income equities cash and alternatives we are proud of our diversified mix of fee income which we believe is a strategic differentiator for us when compared to our peers especially during times of economic uncertainty we consistently rank in the top decile for fee income as a percentage of total net interest revenue and noninterest fee income our revenue mix averaged during the last months that consistently supports a revenue stream that is sustainable through a wide variety of economic cycles i will now turn over the call to marty martin e grunst chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you scott turning to slide third quarter net interest revenue was million a million decrease linked quarter net interest margin was a 31basispoint decrease versus  i will note that basis points of the 31basispoint margin decline was due to growth in the trading securities as the trading securities grow it is dilutive to the net interest margin as it grows earning assets at a narrower spread compared to the rest of the balance sheet net of the 8basispoint impact from trading the remaining 23basispoint decline was driven by the competitive deposit environment as average interestbearing deposit costs increased by basis points linked quarter our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta increased to for the third quarter and noninterest dda continued to shift into interestbearing dda as a percent of total deposits was as of september this slide shows net interest margin and net interest revenue with and without the impact of the trading business to better highlight trends and comparability for the third quarter of the net interest margin excluding the impact of trading assets was versus in the second quarter growth in earning assets during the quarter was driven by trading securities and loans partially offset by a decline in our fair value option securities used to hedge our mortgage servicing asset turning to slide liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers total deposits grew million on a periodend basis and the loantodeposit ratio was up slightly from the previous quarter average total deposits increased million linked quarter with average interestbearing deposits up billion partially offset by an million decline in demand deposits bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 brokered cds have recently been a topic for our industry and we note that our usage of that funding source over time is generally low but not zero brokered cds were million or less than of total funding at quarterend and declined million versus the prior quarterend our tangible common equity ratio was down basis points linked quarter due to balance sheet growth and increases in interest rates but up basis points from yearend adjusted tce including the impact of unrealized losses on heldtomaturity securities is consistent with yearend too cet1 is and if adjusted for aoci would be as the recent regulatory capital proposal is largely focused on banks over billion we have ample capital to support continued organic growth while at the same time allowing for our continued share buyback during the third quarter we repurchased  at an average price of per share turning to slide linked quarter total expenses increased by million or personnel expense was flat linked quarter as increases related to our san antonio and memphis expansions were mostly offset by a decrease in employee benefits nonpersonnel operating expense grew to million occupancy and equipment increased million driven by the retirement of certain atms as we upgrade our network fdic insurance expense increased million combined all other expense categories increased million much of that related to an accrual for certain disputed matters yearoveryear total operating expense increased million or personnel expense increased million or however million of the yearoveryear increase was related to a onetime benefit during the second quarter of from the dissolution of our pension plan combined with linked quarter market adjustments for deferred compensation third quarter also includes million of expansionrelated personnel costs cashbased compensation related to new business production increased million the remaining million yearoveryear increase was primarily regular salaries and benefits with that directly related to annual merit increases and a much lower level of open positions yearoveryear other operating expense increased million or occupancy and equipment increased million with million related to the atm retirements fdic insurance increased million as both the assessment base and the rate increased and data processing increased million primarily due to continued investments in technology these were partially offset by a million decrease in mortgage banking costs as msr amortization slowed turning to slide i will note that we are in the middle of our financial planning process so we are not ready to provide forwardlooking assumptions with the same level of detail as we have for the last few quarters however i will provide the following higherlevel expectations for the next months we continue to expect upper singledigit annualized loan growth economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain favorable and continue to be supported by business inmigration from other markets the competitive environment for loans should be a tailwind for us we expect to continue holding our availableforsale securities portfolio flat and to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position we expect total deposits to be stable or grow modestly and the loantodeposit ratio to remain in the low currently we are assuming no additional rate changes by the federal reserve in or we believe the margin will migrate modestly lower over the next couple of quarters as interestbearing deposit betas level out and demand deposit balance attrition runs its course in aggregate we expect total fees and commissions revenue to grow at a midsingledigit growth rate on a yearoveryear basis and our strategic expansion initiatives to positively impact growth rates for bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 we expect expenses to increase modestly as we continue to invest in strategic growth and technology initiatives with revenue growth following at a slight lag we expect the efficiency ratio to increase with net interest margin changes then migrate downward as revenue growth is realized this does not include the impact of the fdic special assessment which could be finalized in the fourth quarter of our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality we expect quarterly provision expense near recent levels to continue and an eventual move towards normal credit costs later in changes in the economic outlook will affect our provision expense additionally we expect to continue our opportunistic share repurchase activity ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president ceo coo director bok financial corp thanks marty this quarter highlights the benefits of our diverse revenue mix and our strong risk management culture as we and the industry experienced pressure on the margin from increased funding costs while margin pressure is a reality for us and our peers our diverse feebased businesses supply a strong core revenue base that sets us apart excluding the volatile mortgage refinance fees during the second and third quarters of the last five consecutive quarters are the highest for fee income in the companys history we continue to grow and invest in our fee businesses as shown by our recent expansion into memphis and our talented teams collaborate well to ensure we grow our company the right way a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles while the market continues to focus on capital liquidity and credit i see this as a unique opportunity to use our strength in these areas to grow organically and invest in new markets where other financial institutions may be more internally focused we are focused on using the strength of our geographic footprint to grow both in todays climate and in the years ahead with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah its brady good morning guys stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was just wondering yeah your guidance for some continued net interest margin pressure we saw a big move in the third quarter how do you think about the magnitude of how much the margin could decline over the next quarter or two martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah good question brady so i think the way to think about the next quarter or two let me give you a little context so number one i kind of set aside the trading impacts theres really no reason to think that that would be any different itll react to the markets and even if its different thats really denominator effect and dont really drive the numerator so much so  margin decline extrading was basis points and so the positive drivers there were the bond portfolio repricing up the fixed rate portion of the loan book repricing up and loan growth the negatives were the dda mix shift and the deposit beta piece so  should basically see the same positives at very similar magnitude but the negatives in aggregate will be smaller so we expect to see a smaller decline than that basis points in the core margin  to  but still probably in the low double digits to basis points and its really the beta slowing down thats going to be the component that helps there going into  we still think that the positives are about the same in magnitude but the negatives will still outweigh those positives to a lesser degree and well see another but probably smaller margin decline and then after that its increasingly likely that the balances that positives balance out or outweigh the negatives but well give you some more color on that in january brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 okay and then loan growth at a highsingledigit pace is pretty robust today i mean relative to your peers theres not many banks growing at that level so how are you able to kind of grow at that elevated pace relative to your peers in the industry today marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah brady this is marc maun fundamentally our balance sheet is well positioned to allow us to grow the liquidity and loantodeposit ratio of about we have the liquidity capacity to grow our credit metrics are as good as theyve ever been i mean with criticized levels at half where they were prepandemic we dont see any significant issues on the horizon so weve been able to focus on our sales efforts and getting out and getting our teams out in the field working with companies to generate loan growth and while some of our peers are pulling back in that space that has allowed us to grow not just in one particular area but pretty broadly across our ci portfolio healthcare and energy real estate we are expecting some modest growth just because of our own internal limits but we dont we have no reason to discontinue that effort and were going to be very focused on that in the this quarter and in stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp brady this is stacy i just might add i think that marc really hit on and its been a real focal point for us as weve seen the disruption in the industry is others are having to manage their liquidity and capital constraints were not this is a really unique opportunity we have that maybe you get once every years or so to definitely take market share and grow when others are less able to do that and so thats been a real significant focus for us and what i like about the growth is how its been core ci growth where really over the last year energy is such an important part of our business but energy hasnt driven that historically a lot of times when we have strong ci growth energy is the big driver weve had huge growth in commitments there but the outstandings have not and so if you think about by market its really been across our footprint each of the markets has really had a strong year in terms of growth in ci particularly and its been a focus for us and so i think that were optimistic that we can maintain that brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it all right and then finally for me is just on the fee income side its been such a great story for bok this year growing fee income is there any pieces of your fee income that you think are overearning right now that could normalize lower or is all this growth real midsingledigit fee growth is great for this year like is that the way we should kind of think about fee income growth longer term for bok in this midsingledigit level martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah brady this is marty yeah we do think that that is good solid franchise growth that weve been able to generate and if you look out over any 12month or so period were able to grow that consistently at that mid singledigit level and we feel the same about that today than we did a quarter ago scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp and brady this is scott i would add that the if you look at the components second quarter to third quarter we had record highs in the second quarter in a couple of different lines so our energy had we had different pieces bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 that were at the top of the list in the second quarter thats alternated in the third quarter where we have investment banking and other areas so its not coming from any one particular segment or piece so youve got diversification of those fee and commission revenue sources just like we do at the top of the house from a revenue perspective so we feel good about the fact that the various business lines have the ability to generate fees and commissions just all types of fee revenues regardless of what cycle were in brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys operator thank you next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning i was wondering can you provide some guidance marty how youre thinking about net interest income in the fourth quarter just there are so many moving parts and how are you thinking about the trading portfolio and where you think net interest income would bottom do you think its kind of the second quarter we could get to the bottom martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so peter let me just give you a little bit of color on the net interest revenue kind of the components so loan growth thatll give you something like we had about million of loan growth and thats coming on at a ph 250basispoint spread thats one of your positives bond portfolio reprice that averages million a quarter and you kind of get a runoff rate around basis points and a reinvestment yield thats whatever the current market rates were but in the third quarter were able to do that at ph basis points fixed rate loan reprice thats about another million thats repricing up each quarter basis points and so those are the positives deposit betas were still a pretty large impact in  we saw a nice slowdown in the pace of increase in september and so we ended the quarter with a cumulative beta and so we can see that flowing until that slowdown will benefit  and forward and then the dda mix shift we still see that as a higher number in  with likely slowdown after that stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp peter this is stacy i think the answer to be specific i think that marty just kind of provided the pieces there but our view is that youll have more margin deterioration in the fourth quarter less in the first quarter and our current view is that its likely in the first quarter that both margin and net interest revenue are kind of where they trough and then we begin to build back from there plus or minus with not a high degree of precision around the absolute numbers but certainly directionally we think that we likely bottom somewhere around the first quarter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay got it thank you and then stacy just expenses if i think about the company and the strategy and i understand with competitors pulling back and youre taking advantage of this opportunity and investing is there any thought of maybe slowing down some of this investment spending next year just given somewhat of a challenging revenue environment bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp no i mean if you think about i mean peter youve followed us for most of my career here it feels like i mean our view is were running this company not for the next quarter or for the next year but for the next years or years or years and so you get these opportunities like this you have to take advantage of it and i understand the optics but because of our mix of fee revenue were not a sub60 efficiency ratio company weve never been and so having a low efficiency ratio doesnt bother us at all because weve got to of our revenues from feebased businesses that carry a higher efficiency ratio and so were going to be prudent about expenses were not going to do anything thats imprudent there but were going to grow the company and were going to think about things from a longterm perspective not a shortterm perspective that may be the most distinctive advantage we have as a financial institution and were going to take advantage of that peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and just my last question just deposit betas i guess the outlook was by yearend im just wondering if you could update that and how youre thinking about it next year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes we are thinking about that still as for the end of this year and then we do expect that to slow quite a bit next year peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co any idea where it kind of settles out on martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah its probably a little too early to tell but quite a bit lower i mean we saw some nice slowdown in september and we expect to see that slowdown continue peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you operator thank you next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc marc maybe a question for you in your prepared comments you talked about some limits on commercial real estate concentrations and im just curious what that means for overall commercial real estate growth and im particularly interested in the multifamily and industrial because theyve been such big drivers of growth for you guys marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp right what i talked about was we do try to manage our exposure in real estate to a certain percentage of capital and were at the upper end of that range so we have seen growth a lot of the growth that weve seen this year has been funding up of existing deals and construction loans and the number of payoffs have slowed due to the situation in longterm market so we expect that we still have room for modest growth in that next year but its not going to be at the doubledigit rate that weve seen yearoveryear in cre so far we are focused on multifamily and industrial thats where the growth has been we dont see those markets slowing down too much were not focused on retail and certainly not on the office piece so we again it will be something modest it wont be in the same kind of growth rate we had overall this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay also on that same slide talk about what youre doing in office i know its not huge exposure for you but i do see its down and you talked you made a comment about a miniperm option to solve some potential issues can you talk a little bit about that marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp well right currently our office portfolio is very strong from a credit standpoint if we reach a maturity with one of the office loans at this point in time theyre all in good shape and we would have the ability to extend that loan for a short period of time until longerterm markets may open up but we really have no credit no significant credit issues at all in the office portfolio at this time stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp so jon for us a miniperm would be some kind of 20year amortization on a 3year term 3year maturity based on the property continuing to perform as agreed and so the borrower doesnt have to find a permanent refinancing source we can give them a short maturity but a longer ph am consistent with the permanent market to like bridge them until when the permanent markets are more healthy bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay makes sense and then your stock is getting beat up a little bit this morning and its on the nii and margin guide i think primarily but youve been active in the buyback im just curious and you bought a lot higher quite frankly so im just curious your kind of buyback appetite and capacity especially where the stock is thanks stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp yeah i think you can assume that given where the stock is today and given where we bought it in the third quarter we would have a very high appetite for repurchasing shares jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and capacity in general martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah we have very strong capital ratios and weve got the capacity we need to do that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thank you operator thank you next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah so i wanted to get more context around how youre thinking about the efficiency ratio trends over next year or so or maybe beyond a year just given your initiatives and how the net interest income is trending and fee income just when do you think that efficiency ratio finally peaks and you finally see maybe some stability or maybe its coming down stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp brandon the efficiency ratio has never been a metric that we manage to and so were obviously in the middle of our budget preparations for next year so were not going to provide guidance around that today but what i can bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 tell you is every business that we have has a target kind of efficiency ratio that we think about and so what changes our efficiency ratio over time more than anything else is the mix of fee businesses when fee businesses are a higher percent of total revenue the efficiency ratio comes up and when net interest revenues are higher percentage then the efficiency ratio will go down but well continue to look at that by line of business and manage each line of business inside of the our kind of implied expectations for efficiency well continue to look for opportunities as we go through this fall season to look for opportunities for efficiency but we dont run our company that way because so much of the mix of revenue guides that efficiency ratio so thats not how we think about nor how we run the company brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and just to followup on that with these initiatives and the expectations for when that revenue growth will be realized and i know theres a lot of moving parts around that but could you just give us some more context on how youre thinking about when and the timing of that which is based off of preliminary plans martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah just to give you a couple of examples brandon so if you think about our memphis expansion as one of those thats sales and trading producers so that has a fairly rapid rampup just given the nature of that business our san antonio investment thats commercial and wealth primarily and so those all have longer sales cycles and so thatll take a little bit longer to ramp that up than when compared to the memphis expansion so its kind of individual investmentcentric so hopefully that helps brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and then on the technology initiatives could you just give us more color on kind of what youre planning on doing that youre currently not doing now and how you expect that to ramp as you try to manage the company over the next five years stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp so brandon over the last several years weve made material investments in our treasury platform and our customer interface into our commercial and corporate interface into our existing technology systems we have significant investments in our wealth platform that are under way that were continuing to work through and so as i mentioned previously were running the company for the long term not the short term and so we continue to make investments to ensure our technology platforms are competitive and providing our customers with a really positive experience when they interface with us brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay i will hop back in the queue thanks for taking my questions operator thank you next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens inc please go ahead bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning i want to go back to loan growth and i think its good to hear you guys talk about the bank taking advantage of some competition pulling back some as they manage their capital liquidity any commentary about how much of the growth is from largersized deals or syndications i just want to appreciate how much of the growth is larger deals existing syndications versus taking on new customers marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp well its a combination of all that actually we have not had any material increase like in the third quarter in the number of sncs that were involved with our leverage loans are actually going down so were focused on businesses where we can develop a relationship thats broadbased and so were getting a mix of new customers as well as finding our way into some club deals et cetera but nothing were not focused on just getting into syndicated deals and buying participation where we dont have a significant opportunity for relationships martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp its core middle market right down the middle of the fairway as we consistently are over time stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp yeah the as marc mentioned the snc number of sncs isnt different for us between second quarter and third quarter to the extent that were in a shared national credit there is a direct relationship with the borrower we typically have other business associated with them and i think the growth that were seeing is really and why im excited about it is because it is core it is direct relationships people that weve been calling on opportunities that are being created and so thats really important to us and its franchisebuilding over the long term matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful guys my other questions have been addressed thank you stacy c kymes a president ceo coo director bok financial corp thank you operator thank you operator instructions next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo securities please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning following up on that last line of commentary do you have the total balance of shared national credits and participations in the quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2023 marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp yeah the shared national credit volumes were about of our total portfolio and thats kind of mostly in the energy and ci space that made those two areas make up about of the total shared national credits we do ph asian about a quarter of those and about of them are in our local market so were not going outside of our footprint in tracking down those kinds of loans timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay switching to the deposit base the decline linked quarter in demand deposits still its pretty elevated demand is now less than of the total base and is below pandemic levels i guess what are you seeing from a liquidity standpoint from your borrowers i know you said that that pressure seems to be abating i guess whats the outlook for demand deposits as we go into the fourth quarter and into martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so we saw dda average balances down million in  to  and when that happens thats a shift from dda to an interestbearing within the firm then so well see going from  to  we expect the decline to be near that amount going  to  and then in  we expect to see that rate of decline slow quite a bit so when we look at kind of deeper into the portfolio and look at size cohorts we can see the rate of change slowing and thats what gives us some confidence that well see a slowdown here over the next six months  will still be a higher number timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i guess as you guys are thinking about funding the highsingledigit loan growth next year and pairing that with the comment for stable to maybe slightly growing deposits how are you thinking about funding that growth and i guess it appears that the spread youre getting on that loan growth relative to the funding sources is shrinking and im just wondering obviously you have a longerterm outlook but why grow loans at such a fast pace when that spread is going to be shrinking and there is broader economic uncertainty out there right now martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so if you look at the incremental loan growth the spread on that incremental loan volume is actually widening so weve been able to see a widening of spreads on new production and the economics of that new production is strong not to mention the fact that thats coming with full relationships so theres deposits et cetera but that incremental loan growth does have incrementally positive and wider spreads so the funding question its going to be a mix of yes some deposit growth and there may be some smaller amount of wholesale funding in there as well but either way it doesnt matter which side of the whether its funded with wholesale or deposits that is incremental and profitable to be sure timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for
