this call ill now turn the call over to stacy kymes stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials fourth quarter and full year financial results im proud of our record year of earnings in a period with tremendous volatility as we continue to reiterate bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 our strong earnings are really due to our diversified business model which has long been called our strategic identity it also reflects extraordinary dedication by our employees who are serving our customers in all aspects of our business in a very difficult environment while there were aspects to our financial performance in that will not recur in the business that created these opportunistic gains this quarter are franchise starting on slide full year net income was million or per diluted share an increase of million or per diluted share shown on slide fourth quarter net income was million or per diluted share that represents a million decline in net income from last quarters all time quarterly high which benefited from a nonrecurring gain on sale of an alternative investment as well as market conditions that were favorable to our mortgagebacked securities activities within our institutional trading business the key items that drove our decline in linked quarter net income were our feebased business units continue to perform well recognizing the fourth quarter is historically lower than the third quarter linked quarter fee income was down million with a million decline in trading and brokerage fees all driven by unfavorable market volatility in our mbs institutional trading activities mortgage fees decreased million as production activity slowed and margins compressed other revenue decreased million as a result of lower operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of a property all other operating revenue was down million linked quarter primarily related to a million gain realized in the third quarter from the sale of an alternative investment net interest revenue declined million on a linked quarter basis largely driven by a million decline in ppp fees this was partially offset by an increase in nonuse fees from low utilization levels and a basis point decline in our interestbearing cost of funds this quarter we continue to experience some compression in yields on our available for sale portfolio however that impact was materially offset by increased balances in our trading portfolio market conditions and credit trends continue to improve allowing us to release an additional million of our loan loss reserve this quarter which was million less than the third quarter reserve release we have released million in loan loss reserves for the full year expense management remains quite strong although linked quarter direct expenses increased million this quarter million of which was a contribution made to our foundation that serves our communities the remaining increase in expenses is generally related to technology spend a slight increase in business promotion and some operational losses im very proud of our expense management this past year as total direct expenses increased only million or with million of that increase from increased employee medical spend coming off an unusually low as medical procedures were deferred from into these results reflect our disciplined approach to expenses despite significant technology and cyberrelated investments turning to slide total loans were down million for the quarter with ppp loan forgiveness accounts for million of that contraction we believe core loan growth turned a corner this quarter with an increase of million or annualized the good news here is that the growth is being driven by our ci book both in our specialized lending and regional and corporate banking areas core ci excluding energy grew annualized and including energy ci commitments grew as well with relatively no change in the core utilization rate which positions us bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 well with plenty of growth capacity as the economy continues to rebound the net linked quarter growth was muted by continued payoffs in our commercial real estate group however we expect growth to resume there after the first quarter loans attributed to our wealth segment grew million this quarter or annualized average deposits increased another billion this quarter and are billion or higher than the same quarter a year ago assets under management or in custody in our wealth management business grew linked quarter to billion surpassing the billion milestone largely due to sales activity and favorable markets compared to december assets under management or in custody are up billion or ill provide additional perspective on our results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide period end loans in our core loan portfolio were billion a linked quarter increase of million as stacy noted were optimistic weve reached a turning point in our loan trends total ci loans grew million or linked quarter with growth in all categories commercial real estate was down million for the quarter but we expect that payoff trend to reverse after the first quarter loans to individuals grew million linked quarter personal loans driven by our private wealth team increased million while residential mortgage loans decreased million this was largely due to the resale of loans previously sold into ginnie mae mortgage pools that the company repurchased when certain delinquency criteria were met many loans purchased during the pandemic have since been ph cleared and meet the resale qualifications energy balances rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter an increase of million or linked quarter commitments grew faster than outstandings this quarter so utilization levels remain low providing ample capacity for continued growth simply from current customer base we expect to have growth in primarily from ma activity in this space with minimal growth from drilling activity given our longterm expertise and continuing strong commitment to the energy sector we are recognized as a leader in this space and we are wellpositioned for strong growth in the coming year ancillary business for customer hedging investment banking and treasury for this segment set another new record for fee revenue this quarter topping last quarters previous high with linked quarter growth just under healthcare balances also increased up million or linked quarter primarily driven by our senior housing assisted living sector looking forward we remain very confident in our ability to perform from both a growth and credit standpoint in this portfolio as it remains a leader for us core middle market ci realized positive growth this quarter with linked quarter growth of million or ci utilization levels have been running at historic lows but ticked up slightly this quarter given such low utilization levels we still have significant capacity to increase outstanding loans as demand continues to come back online without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition a return to more normal utilization levels organically adds about million of core ci loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty area although only one quarter given the broadbased growth this period were optimistic that ci portfolio is beginning to stabilize and with key indicators pointing toward an improving economy were anticipating solid growth throughout this year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 commercial real estate payoffs continued this quarter with balances down another million we continue to see borrowers use this low rate environment to refinance to the longterm fixed rate nonrecourse market was one of real estates lowest years for portfolio turnover as many of the permanent markets were cautious as those have opened up we see some catchup activity that is inherently a sign of a healthy portfolio we expect these balances to grow in after the first quarter where we will still expect some level of payoffs we have plenty of capital allocated for this space to grow in and beyond ppp loan balance forgiveness was million this quarter reducing outstandings to only million of the remaining ppp balances less than million are of the vintage we continue to work with our clients through the forgiveness process and expect any future remaining balances to be minimal we believe the fourth quarter was the inflection point we have been looking for and are confident we are wellpositioned to build off that momentum and return to a normal loan growth cycle as we move into the first quarter of as supply chain constraints ease and the economy benefits from the full impact of the fiscal stimulus bokf will be wellpositioned for accelerated loan growth turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to improve significantly as we move further out from the pandemic we continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio excluding loans guaranteed by us government agencies nonperforming assets fell million linked quarter to million over the last months nonperforming assets are down million or overall asset quality is better than prepandemic levels these and other credit quality metrics combined with continued strength in the commodity prices and outlook for moderate growth in gdp and labor markets resulted in a million release in reserves this quarter we realized net recoveries of for the fourth quarter an improvement compared to million in net chargeoffs for the third quarter net chargeoffs have dropped to an average of basis points over the past four trailing quarters which is at the lower end of our historical loss range as we look forward to the next quarter we expect net chargeoffs will continue to be at the lower end of our historical range the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans and unfunded commitments at quarterend excluding ppp loans nonaccruing loans decreased million from last quarter primarily due to a reduction in nonaccruing energy and commercial real estate loans partially offset by an increase in nonaccruing healthcare loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarterend down from million on september potential problem energy healthcare services and general business loans all decreased compared to the prior quarter with that ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the fourth quarter a million decline from third quarter the third quarter saw recordsetting revenues from our wealth management group largely driven by increased institutional trading and sales related to mortgagebacked securities activities with higher trading volumes and spreads which were heightened by intentional moves to shorter duration paper fourth quarter trading volume declined as many investors moved to the sidelines on the news of the upcoming taper by the fed yearend balance sheet management and concerns over yield steepening in the curve the result was a million linked quarter decline in trading revenues this was partially offset by increased bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 commercial syndication fees and derivatives resulting in a net linked quarter decline in brokerage and trading of million or regarding our mbs trading activities we expect the balance sheet usage to remain fairly consistent through the next several quarters and trading volumes to increase as investors get more active post yearend were expecting continued compression in the margin primarily due to increasing interest rates banking products and services for private wealth clients continue to be a particular area to highlight the total loan portfolio increased million or linked quarter and has increased million or just over since december the deposit portfolio ending the quarter at billion grew linked quarter and was up compared to the same quarter a year ago also in the wealth management space fiduciary and asset management fees were up almost linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago the fourth quarter saw assets under management surpass billion with linked quarter growth of taking those balances to billion compared to this time last year assets under management have grown billion or while we have seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances sales activity remained strong in this space as well our current mix of assets under management is fixed income equities cash and alternatives our relationshipdriven business model is perfectly in touch with clients needs today as we continue to see institutions and individuals retain the increased appreciation for financial advice gained through the past months transaction card revenue increased linked quarter as activity volumes increased for the full year card revenues are up compared to this is largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of the us economy deposit service charges were down this quarter primarily centered in our consumer segment on a total year basis deposit service charges have increased million from commercial activity mortgage banking revenue decreased million or linked quarter primarily due to lower production volumes combined with narrowing margins in addition to normal seasonal declines industrywide housing inventory constraints continue to impact the market our revenue declined million or linked quarter as a result of lower operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of a property although not included on slide i will also note that the net income benefit in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was million in the fourth quarter down million linked quarter also included in our total other operating revenue but not reflected on slide is a million linked quarter decline in gains and losses on other assets this is due to the million net gain we realized in the third quarter from activity in our alternative investment group as we noted last quarter this area of focus is on providing equity and debt capital to growing businesses many of whom have been strong customers of bok financial we expect this area to continue to provide earnings in the future with the timing difficult to predict ill now turn the call to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 thank you scott turning to slide fourth quarter net interest revenue was million a million decline from last quarter that was primarily due to a million linked quarter decline in ppp fees average earning assets increased billion to billion compared to last quarter primarily due to a growth in our average trading securities portfolio to support our brokerage and trading business interestbearing cash increased million average total deposits grew billion with noninterest deposits of billion this quarter allowing us to reduce average other borrowings billion linked quarter net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter with the decrease primarily driven by the continued ppp forgiveness activity dilutive impact of a larger trading portfolio and linked quarter declines in core average loan balances ppp loans supported net interest margin by basis points in the third quarter and basis points in the fourth quarter excluding all ppp impact to both quarters margins fourth quarters net interest margin would be approximately down basis points from last quarter the reinvestment of cash flows from our available for sale securities portfolio resulted in an basis point linked quarter decline in average yields and the yield on our trading portfolio declined over basis points additionally we had continued success driving net interest deposit costs down additional basis point to basis points on average for the quarter we believe the core margin is at a low point however we do not expect any meaningful upward migration in net interest margin until rates begin to rise again turning to slide with anticipated rate hikes on the nearterm horizon it is important to highlight our current asset sensitive balance sheet positioning as well as to recall how well we performed during the last rate hike cycle from to while we cant be assured to repeat the top quartile performance among regional banks that we experienced last time we dont see much that would lead us to believe the experience will be materially different this time around as you can see from our current interest rate risk estimate we anticipate that if rates increased basis points gradually over months net interest revenue would increase over million weve provided some additional context on expectations and assumptions affecting this projection including our view that well continue to hold the available for sale securities portfolio flat keeping our asset sensitivity near current levels additionally the majority of our loan book is variable rate or reprices within a year with most of those repricing in three months or less as weve touched on during previous quarters some of those variable rate loans are impacted by rate floors the impact of which will diminish as rates begin to rise lastly ill highlight our expectation for our deposit betas or the rate at which we expect our deposit rates to increase relative to market rates while individual deposit betas will vary by type we expect total deposit betas to be approximately in our basis point gradual increase scenario similar to those experienced coming out of the last near zero rate environment in fact there is even more liquidity in the system today than before the last rate increase cycle which should diminish the need for the market to move rates up quickly on slide you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio declined from last quarter to just at december largely due to the billion increase in total deposits this quarter this significant onbalance sheet liquidity leaves us well positioned to meet future increase in customer loan demand our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating range minimum with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 turning to slide our expense management efforts were very successful this year with total yearoveryear expense growth of only million or with million of that increase related to return to normal in employee medical expenses linked quarter total expenses increased million however million of that increase was related to a contribution to our foundation for the communities we serve personnel expense decreased million linked quarter with cashbased incentive compensation down due to reduced trading activity this was primarily offset by an increase in sharebased compensation resulting from improved performance versus our peer group regular compensation expense continues to run fairly flat as it has all year for the year total personnel expenses increased million or including the increase in medical spend mentioned earlier we expect to continue to manage personnel cost effectively going forward but realize there is risk here related to inflation that is beginning to show in the current labor market nonpersonnel expense increased million this quarter as already noted million of increase is foundation contribution additionally professional fees data processing and communications expense combined increased million as a result of various project investments on slide ill provide guidance in a few key areas as we begin we expect loan growth to accelerate as we move through the year with periodend pointtopoint growth for the year in the to range line utilization in our ci portfolios is expected to increase in particularly in energy but likely not completely back to prepandemic levels during we expect growth in all of our regional markets and continued growth in our wealth division deposits are expected to decline less than pointtopoint during with no significant change in deposit composition or mix we will maintain the available for sale securities portfolio flat during the year by reinvesting cash flows at current rates by keeping the securities portfolio leveled well be able to maintain our asset sensitivity to up basis points spread across the first year at between to as it relates to net interest income indiscernible second year impact of basis points is expected to be above our deposit betas a key assumption in determining rate sensitivity will vary by type but average for the first basis point move very similar to the experience coming out of the last near zero rate environment a few years ago core net interest income excluding the impact of ppp between the years is expected to grow driven higher as loan growth picks up core net interest margin seems to have bottomed and we expect to see improvement as the federal reserve starts hiking rates and loans begin to grow total fee revenues will not repeat historically high levels of trading and brokerage and mortgage revenue will decline mid to upper single digits compared to last year all other fee categories are expected to post mid single digit growth total fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues is expected to stay at or near our goal is to maintain operating expense growth at or below for this will support operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio in concert with revenue growth from higher loan balances certainly one risk in this environment is labor inflation which well watch closely and attempt to manage appropriately bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 we expect the overall loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances to migrate towards by the end of very close to the day one cecl levels we expect to continue opportunistic quarterly share repurchase within the total dollar ranges spent over the past several quarters ill now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven as i mentioned at the top of the call im very proud of our record year of earnings during another period of tremendous volatility although our lending businesses were challenged with significant deleveraging by our clients we continue to partner with our customer in strategies for their borrowing and expansion needs going forward have been successful in growing our customer base positioning us well for growth in the near future based on what we experienced this past quarter with growth in our core loan commitment and balance levels were optimistic about growth in this area in the coming year this past year has served as an excellent example of the success of our diversified business model as weve seen our feebased businesses and our alternative investment strategy generate earnings while our lending outcomes were slowed by impacts of the pandemic credit quality has improved to the point that we are now better than prepandemic levels over the longterm regardless of the cycle our credit outcomes have long been a differentiator for us while this quarters earnings were down from our third quarter record we believe we are wellpositioned across the company for growth in we expect external forces such as supply chain and labor disruptions will continue to improve as well as other economic indicators that continue to show positive trends all providing opportunities for growth market expectations for a rising rate environment further enhance our potential outcomes as we are well well positioned for a rising rate we operate in a fastgrowing regional footprint that we expect to provide stronger growth in the national economy over time im excited about the future of bok financial with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed q hi this is ph john rowland for jared steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hey ph john stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning q good morning just starting out with expenses steven i know you commented on the weaker trading result is driving the personnel costs a little bit lower this quarter but ph were kind of surprised that seem more of an offset there can we expect kind of a catchup on that in or i guess can you just comment a little bit more on how those two are linked steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no i think the biggest offset to that we did see a decline in the commissionbased expenses that hit personnel costs this quarter but we also offset that going the other direction with some stockbased compensation accruals based on our estimation of our performance relative to our peer group which youll find in the proxy so we take a look at that each quarter we determine how are we going to perform relative to that peer group for a longterm incentive and we had an offsetting kind of that number offset some of the decline that you saw on the commission side for this quarters personnel expense is that helpful q yeah thats helpful and then i guess just turning to the balance sheet youve separately kind of been optimistic on energy lending in energy vertical and healthcare could we expect those to grow a little bit faster than the to growth rate that you put out there and within that guidance is there any improvement in the utilization rate that youre baking into that marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah this is mark maun as far as the energy market goes we do expect to increase outstandings in that as well see more ma activity potentially more drilling activity with prices as high as they are we did do billion in new commitments during so the capacity not only increased as a result of oil prices and gas prices but also because of new customer capacity under the energy portfolio on ci we do expect utilization to recover its stabilized to date but hasnt fully recovered to a higher level but the key is our commitments have remained steady so we really havent lost any capacity in the ci market so as the economy continues to perform we expect utilization to improve another key area of growth is going to be our cre group we did over billion in new commitment approvals in the majority of which were construction loans so as we expect and are guiding there we expect payments to be reduced following the first quarter we will expect a natural funding of our cre portfolio throughout so all of those things combined give us a lot of comfort in our guidance on the loan growth stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp ph yeah on the commercial real estate side that billion i think is a record for new commitments in any single year so strong production there you just have the permanent markets that are creating just a little bit of a headwind but were optimistic that as we get into the second quarter and beyond that what youre going to see there are the hard work that created the strong growth in commitments really show up in cre q okay i guess specifically within that its kind of hard to tell what the payoffs and paydowns in there but are you seeing is the growth in like multifamily or office can get a little bit more give a little more color around the specific areas marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp sure our focus has been in all four areas but we are seeing more of the activity in our multifamily in our industrial areas as strong growth and another component of our cre group is our senior health group that focuses on construction of new senior housing it has a great quality track record in that weve had no issues on it for the past years and we see opportunities for growth in that area as well q okay great thanks thats all from me thanks for answering my questions steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i know youre expecting available for sale balances to remain roughly flat from here but what about the outlook for trading securities i know theyve seen a lot of growth this year especially in the fourth quarter theyre now over billion what do you expect from that line going forward scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah hi brady this is scott grauer so we expect it to be consistent with where were at right now we look for that to really be fairly flat as we work throughout the course of the year we think weve got it at a level that were comfortable with we think it sustains kind of the activity flow that were seeing which obviously was challenged in late october on into november but we did see a pickup in december and weve seen the trend continue to improve as weve operated thus far in january so we think we look to hold that steady at this point throughout the as far as we can see brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then steven when you talk about the guidance of the reserve down to basis points by the end of the year i just wanted to clarify are you talking just about the allowance for loan losses or the allowance for loan losses plus the reserve for offbalance sheet like the or the is what youre pointing to steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think were talking about the so the combined reserve including unfunded commitments indiscernible steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp towards the level brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it all right and then finally for me its nice to see you guys buy back stock in almost every quarter last year in i think you repurchased it at around or and the stock is now north of so how do you think about the buyback going forward and on the flip side with the stronger currency that could potentially lead to bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 better bank ma deals maybe just the balance of how you look at buybacks versus using your currency to acquire steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so let me take the buyback and ill let stacy comment a little bit on ma but i think that buybacks will be kind of an ongoing part of how we utilize some of our capital build and excess capital you saw us buyback a little bit of shares not as much as we did certainly in the third quarter at the mark but we did buy some back in the hundreds range not as many so i think going forward youll see us opportunistically kind of pick our spot but utilize some cash and i think i guided to a similar level across multiple quarters a similar level of total dollars that well spend to buy back shares i think its kind of a normal part of what we do going forward stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp this is stacy on the ma front i think clearly our currency is better but the sector has seen improvement there as well so any target that we might have probably has seen improvement in their stock price as well really from my perspective ma is important but not something that were focused on i think its got to be opportunistic its got to be the exact right fit from my perspective im more interested in product niches technology investments things that we can do that arent necessarily disruptive to the whole company to integrate and to socially and culturally integrate there could be that perfect opportunity covid was just a perfect fit for us and everything that has gone on over time just continues to demonstrate what a great fit that was for our culture and our company and really accelerating our growth in denver and phoenix particularly so it would have to be something bigger than that it would have to be something that similarly would fit our culture that would be something that we could readily assimilate but were more interested in product lines or other niches inside of our revenue streams that would be an addon and not necessarily completely impact the company brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right got it thanks guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from matt olney with stephens incorporated please proceed matthew olney q analyst stephens inc thanks guys appreciate the disclosures around the loan floors on slide and it looks like you gave us that of the commercial portfolios reprice in one year im curious if you have the dollar amount of loans that will reprice immediately with libor or fed funds more of a nearterm disclosure thanks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i dont know if i can answer that specifically i know that inside that i think or more that reprices in less than three months so i mean its very short stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp most of our libor loans are ph in the one month category steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp we dont do a lot of longer term tranches under the libor scenario its going to be the vast majority of that is going to be really quick steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then i guess the guidance does assume that the fed starts the hike in the middle part of the year can you be more specific about what the assumptions are around rates not just for fed funds but also on the long end of the curve which is relevant obviously given the size of your securities portfolio steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so we gave disclosure of what would happen we believe if rates go up basis points but what weve really frankly what weve built in our budget is a couple of rate increases beginning midyear starting whatever the timeframe may or june and then another one out towards the end of the year thats what we built in when i guided to that growth in net interest income on a core basis and that excludes any kind of differential in ppp so that hopefully that helps a bit in knowing kind of how were thinking about it i mean certainly theres lots of predictions out in the market with forward increases maybe even more we chose not to build that that much into our budget were a little bit more conservative perhaps than others but thats how we calculated the guidance on the growth of core net interest income for stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp we think obviously the market is moving around quite a bit here towards the beginning of the year in terms of what they think the fed is going to do as we built our thinking and as steven put together in the guidance that we disclosed today around net interest income we thought that the fed would move likely slower a bit slower than bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 the market anticipated however if someone has a different view weve provided the level of disclosure there so that you can just kind of bake that in and get an understanding of that matt youve done some of the best work ive seen in the analyst community on looking at the last time rates went up but who actually was the most asset sensitive and i think we all disclosed all these different things and everybodys got a different assumption around deposit betas and when the fed moves and all that kind of stuff but i think the core is we outperformed in the regional banks space the last time there was a rising rate cycle and i think theres nothing inherent or intrinsic in our balance sheet or how we operate the bank today that would lead us to believe that there will be a different outcome this time in fact the system overall and certainly us weve got more liquidity than weve ever had and so if anything i think banks will be more likely to move slower than they did last time so we tried to provide kind of the fairway or the boundaries so that if folks have different views about that they can kind of interpolate but certainly i think the last rate cycle if you look across the spectrum is going to be one of the best ways to try to compare banks matthew olney q analyst stephens inc yeah okay thanks for that stacy and agree that the bank is in a relatively really good spot for higher rates and also appreciate that the macro assumptions in the market seem to change week to week so definitely appreciate you guys just disclosing kind of what you did that will allow us to kind of work backwards there switching gears over to the operating expense guidance for i think youre saying you want to maintain this run rate quarterly run rate around that million per quarter that we saw in the fourth quarter thatd be pretty impressive given the wage inflation that were hearing from other banks and just the general tax spend what else should we be mindful of that would allow the bank to have more moderate expense growth in versus many of your peers steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah your first assumption of kind of the quarterly progression around the million thats pretty close i mean frankly we put all our budgets together in a real detailed fashion we think we can control personnel costs i did caution in our guidance that certainly wage inflation is there it hasnt been you see it showing up in some spots in our company but it hasnt been across the board an issue for us at this point now will it become that we dont know we said well watch it closely and manage that expense appropriately we do think we can maintain pretty good control of expenses were allowing some growth i think in business promotion to help support our businesses were certainly allowing continued growth in some of our tech spend and some of the projects that we have going to support those customerfacing type systems so there are some growth characteristics around the expense base in certain categories but we still feel like we can maintain the kind of control that we did in as we move through this current year stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 matt this is stacy just to add on there i think if you look at our turnover our turnover per year in was actually a little bit better than it was in the last kind of precovid year and so while steven alluded to pockets there are some pockets that were watching a little more carefully as a company overall our turnover levels are actually very good and so its a risk factor one were not we certainly see what others are saying in the market those appear to be kind of different types of banks different types of positions and maybe a core regional bank would be here located kind of in the middle of the country but certainly we feel good about our ability to control expenses next year matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay great thats all for me thanks guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from gary tenner with da davidson please proceed clark wright q analyst da davidson companies good morning this is clark wright speaking on behalf of gary tenner most of my questions were already answered just maybe a clarification on one i was just wondering when youre talking your outgoing operating expenses and the that youre guiding to is there any offsetting savings that are factored into that steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp not really i mean i think to the previous analyst question kind of the level that we see going forward of total operating expenses is somewhere around that million mark were just shy of that this quarter although we did include million contribution to our foundation so it would have been lower but thats not a bad place to start from a quarteronquarter basis clark wright q analyst da davidson companies got it thank you very much operator that concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments steven e nell executive vice president chief
