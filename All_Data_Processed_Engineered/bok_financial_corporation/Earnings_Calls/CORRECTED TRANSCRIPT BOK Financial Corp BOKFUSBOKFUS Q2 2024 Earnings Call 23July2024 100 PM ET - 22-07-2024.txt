during this call ill now turn the call over to stacy kymes who will begin on slide stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you heather we are pleased to report earnings in the second quarter of million or eps of per diluted share adjusting for notable items such as the visa gain and related charitable contribution net income would have been million and eps would have been per share last quarter i shared an overview of our strategy which is based on driving longterm shareholder value by focusing on a welldiversified loan portfolio including one of the lowest levels of commercial real estate concentration among peers at of total loans disciplined credit quality which has produced attractive net chargeoff versus peers for more than years industryleading fee income business mix top tier risk management practices with a disciplined focus on capital and liquidity with a loantodeposit ratio below and asset liability management practices that have led to wellcontrolled levels of tangible common equity or tce all of which together allowed us to welcome new business during periods when others were on hold all paired with an attractive geographic footprint in dynamic highgrowth markets these core tenets of our operating philosophy have enabled us to produce attractive returns over time and given us a resilience to market stresses that are unmatched every time youve seen a stress event in the market we outperform as credit issues surfaced during the great financial crisis we performed incredibly well compared to others in our industry being the largest traditional bank not to participate in tarp our loan book performance was also strong when energy prices moved lower in and and again during covid when interest rate risk management issues arose in march of last year after an almost 500basispoint increase in rates in one year we were positioned well with one of the higher levels of tce and more than ample liquidity bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 and now again as the market shows concern over commercial real estate concentration bokf has one of the lowest levels of exposure with less than total loans as a percentage of tier capital and reserves on a committed basis and of tier capital and reserves on an outstanding basis importantly for our shareholders we are wellpositioned for growth and to produce attractive returns as you see on slide weve meaningfully outgrown eps versus the krx index over the last years over that time weve had an cagr versus the index only growing at a median rate of in fact there were only three banks that grew eps at a faster rate than bokf this graph illustrates our ability to profitably grow at an attractive rate while also having a indiscernible risk management culture that provides stability during diverse market conditions it can be tempting to put banks into one of two groupings some banks are high growth and higher risk and others are lower growth and lower risk weve proven over a long history that we can be both a strong stable company and produce a higher longterm growth profile since i spent some time last quarter talking about our longerterm strategy this quarter i want to highlight opportunities we see in the market and how we intend to capitalize on them moving to slide our loan portfolio and credit quality is a good starting point looking at the federal reserves h8 data you will see that loans for the broader industry were generally flat during the quarter however bokf loans increased million or linked quarter with growth driven by commercial loans despite payoff activity in commercial real estate cre payoffs while they made slow loan growth are nonetheless a part of a healthy portfolio all of our payoff activity has been in the normal course of that lending activity the ci portfolio grew at approximately annualized or annualized excluding certain seasonal advances this didnt happen by accident the ci sales process is a long one and our process wasnt created this quarter or last but is rather a reflection of the fruits of our last few years of concentrated efforts to grow this portfolio as youll see from our credit metrics we havent done this at the expense of our disciplined credit underwriting profile net chargeoffs are still very low nonperforming loans have again moved lower and our criticized classified levels are of tier and reserves which is among the lowest of the largest banks and wellbelow prepandemic levels marc will elaborate on this but we believe that strong guarantors and geography play a critical role in the performance of our cre portfolio as part of our underwriting process we stress each loan at origination for a rising interest rate environment we understand the overall credit metrics are below their long term sustainable levels and will revert toward normal as the economic conditions change our fee income businesses remained strong at of total revenue you cannot find another regional bank that has the same level of fee income businesses that have been built over many decades and are all operating at scale these businesses produce attractive returns and offer a diversifying or countercyclical benefit to our net interest income streams regardless of challenging market conditions you also saw it monetize of our visa stock in their recent exchange program many other bank liquidated this asset well before now at deep discount however given our longterm focus we held onto this investment and achieved full value for these assets the gains generated offset the afs repositioning losses you saw it take in the first quarter which produced a million a year benefit to nii with less than twoyear payback period we remain impressed by the progress we are seeing in san antonio and central texas which are still operating ahead of their pro forma projections we continue to look for opportunities to add talent in all of our markets bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 finally we repurchased over  this quarter to reflect our longterm confidence in the company and to take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations im proud of the quarter that bokf team has put together and appreciate the time to review it with you this afternoon and with that ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide overall loans increased linked quarter with commercial loans up and cre down by portfolio yields increased basis point during the quarter i wanted to spend just a moment expanding on some of stacys opening commentary ci loans grew over  even after adjusting for certain seasonal advances we still experienced solid ci loan growth of or annualized the sales cycle for ci is a long one for many there is a greater emphasis on growing ci than there was a few quarters ago especially with the markets concern about the cre space this isnt what youre seeing from us weve been focused for the last several years on growing the ci business segment in our view this is one of our most profitable businesses when we think about growing ci we know that coming with that credit relationship will be deposits and oftentimes core operational accounts treasury management revenue and many other opportunities the results you see reflect our intentional commitment to this effort we feel good about our performance today and our ability to sustain this growth for the remainder of the year overall loan growth was muted slightly by cre payoffs this is a good outcome the normal lifecycle of our cre portfolio involves the bank providing funding while a project is under construction and then a sponsor selling the property once it has been developed this payoff activity reflects the health of this book of business and importantly all of this payoff activity within the normal course of business previous payoff levels were somewhat dampened during the rise in the overall rate environment as well as the limited activity in the permanent lending space which is sponsored primarily by agencies life insurance companies and the cmbs market however recent payoff activity has returned to normal historical level with elevated activity in the permanent space and stable valuations within the bulk of cre asset classes turning to our different loan segments loan balances in the energy business increased linked quarter as a reminder our energy book is composed of approximately oil weighted borrowers and natural gas weighted borrowers our energy customers are wellhedged for at least the next year which means we lowered our commodity pricing risk on the collateral of these loans weve continued to grow commitments over the last several years in this business but are still seeing customers use lower levels of leverage in this space which has kept outstandings at current levels our combined general business and service loans grew linked quarter and adjusted for seasonal advances this remains a core focus from a loan growth perspective for us our healthcare business loans decreased linked quarter credit quality in this portfolio remains strong as a reminder roughly twothirds of the portfolio is in senior housing combining a diversified mix of skilled nursing facilities that are medicaremedicaid based stabilized private pay senior living integrated health systems predominantly with investment grade equivalent ratings and other specialized providers the healthcare line of business has a national footprint but is focused on regional operators with multiple locations the diversity and deep knowledge of their markets we have a long history of strong underwriting in this space bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 our cre business decreased quarteroverquarter we continue to manage to a strict concentration limit which is of tier capital and reserves on a committed basis we know that ebbs and flows over time and this quarter we were down to you have to look back to the fourth quarter of indiscernible with the lower cre concentration we do not have the outsized exposure that others do in this space and while we have capacity and are not afraid to lend in this space we are not chasing deals but numbers on the board we believe client selection plays a leading role in the performance of this product loans are subjected to multiple stress tests in the underwriting process including those with stress interest rates and payment shocks we also believe a few key factors over and above the standard underwriting play a critical role in the performance of this product first is guarantor support we have meaningful support in over of all cre loans with counterparties that we have known for a long time and have demonstrated commitment to supporting their transaction second is geographic location this portfolio is geographically diverse but importantly with most exposure within the strong economies in our footprint and very little exposure in the areas of the country that weve seen the largest pullback in prices as we discussed last quarter our credit culture is fundamental to the way that we do business our strong underwriting standards are calibrated to our experience in each of our lines of business and our process is a consistent disciplined approach designed to avoid fluctuating standards based on the economic conditions approximately of our commercial and cre loan portfolios are floating rate or repriced in the next year so this variable has always been a principal factor for us on slide you will notice credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio and wellbelow historical norms nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies decreased million this quarter an exceptional outcome the resulting nonperforming assets the periodend loans and repossessed assets decreased basis points to and nonaccruing loans decreased million linked quarter committed criticized assets remained wellbelow prepandemic levels as a percentage of capital net chargeoffs were million or basis points annualized for the second quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months extending the trend of performance far below our historic loss range of to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to remain below historical norms we remain wellreserved with combined allowance for credit losses of million or of outstanding loans at quarterend with the million provision reflecting a stable operating environment and loan growth expectations we believe the combined reserve is the most appropriate metric to consider if you want a holistic view of comparative credit reserve levels we expect to maintain an appropriate reserves for a loan growth and reflective of economic conditions weve traditionally outperformed during challenging credit cycles and are well positioned should an economic slowdown materialize and now ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp thank you marc now turning to slide im proud of both the results we posted this quarter and the strategic initiatives our excellent team has accomplished after years of planning and organizational readiness we successfully launched a modernized wealth management platform on july initial results have been very encouraging and the client experience with the transition has been positive this was a complicated project that required much planning and bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 thought we didnt rush to find a solution but patiently orchestrated a positive outcome for the company our employees and most importantly our customers and id like to thank everyone who was involved now turning to our operating results for the quarter total fee income contributed million of revenue this quarter that represents of total revenue which is a peerleading contribution from these businesses and reflects the strength of our franchise in the space ill begin by covering our markets and securities businesses again on slide our trading fees decreased to million during the quarter consistent with broader industry trends for this activity driven by slightly lower trading spreads versus the prior quarter this business is primarily composed of our fixed income trading business and mortgagebacked securities and to a lesser extent municipal bond trading we found a unique franchise in this business as we facilitate the hedging and production of mortgages for more than mortgage originators this line item will be most influenced by changes in mortgage origination volume when volume is higher both our trading spreads and volume will increase importantly were at a very low levels of origination volume and were still seeing attractive results in this business while this may be volatile its often countercyclical with our net interest income businesses and produces good diversification of our existing revenue streams mortgage banking revenue remained relatively consistent this quarter at million reflecting continued improvement in the mortgage origination market and increased volumes from customer hedging has remained steady at million this quarter this revenue stream is associated with the hedging activity we facilitate on behalf of customers we offer our customers the ability to hedge commodities interest rates and foreign exchange the largest component of this revenue is driven by our energy customers hedging their oil and natural gas production in many cases energy customers are required to hedge as part of their loan agreement when markets become more volatile income tends to increase to give a few examples when oil prices increased in the first half of we saw energy customers take advantage of those higher prices and lock in protection on more of their production by putting on hedges with us as a result our income in this segment increased at that time another example is when rates decreased substantially during covid in our customers perceived that it was an attractive time to participate in interest rate hedging and engaged with our desk to use interest rate swaps to convert floating rate loans to fixed the brokerage fee line item previously included insurance business that we sold fourth quarter of last year which explains most of the yearoveryear decrease in this line item however in looking specifically at brokerage excluding insurance weve experienced solid growth in this segment turning to slide to cover our asset management and transactions businesses asset management revenue increased to million this was primarily driven by seasonal tax preparation fee income auma increased by billion as valuations increased there were a couple of primary factors that drive results in this business the first is the amount of assets under management and administration this can change as the valuations of our clients bond and equity portfolios increase or decrease in value as a result of our sales team growing new accounts second is the spread we earn on assets under management this quarter we earned basis points on total auma for managed funds weve earned basis points and for funds under administration we earned basis points within each of these segments the type of customer will also influence the amount of fees earned our revenue will change as you see migration within our business mix transaction card revenue increased by to million driven by an increase in volume of transactions processed during the quarter this business is a top electronic funds transfer business which provides debit and credit issuing processing or eft solutions for almost financial institutions and merchant processing bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 solutions for over businesses throughout the united states and virgin islands again im proud of the results for this quarter and now ill hand the call over to marty to cover the financials martin e grunst chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you scott let me start by commenting on the visa exchange program we covered in our last earnings call this program allowed us to monetize of our visa b shares in the second quarter and recognize a million pretax gain this gain offset the million securities loss we took in the first quarter and enabled us to donate million worth of those converted shares to the bokf foundation to further invest in the communities we serve turning to slide capital and liquidity continue to be very strong cet1 is and tce is tce adjusted for all securities portfolio losses is the capital strength we have displayed over the years and in the most recent year in particular is the result of capital planning and stress testing processes that include tce as well as the regulatory ratios and serves us well in all economic environments our current loantodeposit ratio stands at and our coverage of uninsured and noncollateralized deposits increased to with this quarters deposit growth of million our strong capital position enabled our opportunistic approach to share buyback during the second quarter we repurchased just over  at an average price of per share turning to slide you will see that net interest income grew million versus the prior quarter demonstrating that the trough in this line item is behind us strong loan growth and asset pricing continued to support nii growth and deposit headwinds continue to abate the interestbearing deposit cost increase of basis points for this quarter was less than a third of what it was in the prior quarter the dda average balance decline was also less than a third of what it was in the prior quarter net interest margin was sequentially lower by basis points but basis points of the basis points were driven by the denominator effect of higher average balances for the trading portfolio and the afs securities portfolio that securitiesrelated growth was largely neutral to net interest income we remain confident that net interest income will continue to grow sequentially driven by loan growth and the repricing of the fixed rate portion of our balance with a stable or modestly increasing net interest margin turning to slide linkedquarter total expenses decreased million or personnel expense fell million driven by a number of factors some of which were more timing related such as the incentive compensation items and some are not such as the payroll taxes and the benefits expense in addition to the million visa share donation mentioned earlier on the call we also made a million contribution to the bokf foundation this quarter we recognized million of expense related to the fdic special assessment estimate in  compared to million in  all remaining expenses were consistent with the priorquarter activity turning to slide this provides our outlook for our net interest income guidance of billion presumes one rate cut for in november we expect fees and commissions to be in the neighborhood of million were assuming recent securities trading revenue trend to persist into  and mbs trading is the primary driver of potential variability in that element of guidance we expect the efficiency ratio for the full year to be near we anticipate provision expense to be similar to or somewhat lower than levels given our very low level of nonperforming assets and our stable economic outlook bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 with that i would like to hand the call back to the operator for qa which will be followed by closing remarks from stacy question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions scott maybe for you we can start off appreciate all the color on the fee businesses it looks like maybe the takedown in the guidance really just relates the second quarter results in brokerage and trading line item can you just talk as we hopefully get a few rate cuts here or at least if we bake in the forward curve and then whats into next year how you would expect that business really to perform and it seems to me just based on some of your explanations around some of the fee businesses especially that and mortgage that were probably at or near a low point and those businesses look like they have some tailwind as we move into next year if we do get some cuts thanks scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp you bet and so in essence you answered your question exactly how i would as i mentioned i agree with you i think that we have settled into the current rate environment and the current mortgage production levels so what were seeing there we think is it has in essence bottomed what will stimulate further activity in the mbs piece specifically which is the biggest variable there that marty mentioned is whether or not we get a fed rate cut which will stimulate greater mortgage production which picks up the tba piece the mortgage originator hedging activity for us that increased volume will help us there additionally our downstream activity to our financial intermediaries that we actively serve with mbs product on managing their portfolios will move out the curve once we get some clarity out of the fed move so we do think that as we move into an environment where fed cuts well see a pickup in activity and the net mortgage production will increase the volume and the flows michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate it and then maybe just as a followup for marc it sounds like loan pipelines are pretty good at this point i would expect some of those cre paydowns to slow as we move into the back half of the year but we are seeing ci companies generally delever a little bit particularly in the clients that you would serve and just given this quarters strong growth how do you kind of reconcile the two just based on what were seeing at some other banks and would just love some color there thanks marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 well i think the main thing here weve been doing on the ci side is we have been actively doing this for quite some time ci loans take a while to obtain because its more of a relationshiporiented business and not driven by transactions around capital and asset acquisition and so its not been a matter of lower usage by our existing customer but weve been able to obtain new customers and so weve actually had a broader growth pattern than weve had for quite some time so we think we can continue to sustain that maybe not at the level we saw in the second quarter but excluding the seasonal advances we expect to see something similar to that for the rest of the year and on cre youre right we do expect payoffs to slow but we have the opportunity to look for the right kind of deals to add new deals and it will mostly be in the construction phase so itll take some time for those to fund up but we expect to see that over the next months stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp michael this is stacy i mean i think our geographic footprint here is awfully helpful but to go back to the original thesis here weve been focused on this but at the same time we were really gearing up our sales effort here is when a year ago last spring was when the markets felt disruption and so others who may not be seeing that there are those who are ostensibly pulling back to manage their liquidity and capital in a different way and so part of the growth that were seeing is adding talent adding market share and being in really great markets to grow from and so its kind of the confluence of all those that are creating the outsized growth for us this quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful i appreciate all the color and marc congratulations on your upcoming retirement thanks marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banking bok financial corp oh thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good afternoon everyone stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good afternoon brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc i wanted to start with hey guys wanted to start with i know you dont give explicit margin guidance but wanted just if you take a look at the nii guide for the full year it basically implies that the margin is up about basis points for the back half of i just wanted to see if im thinking about that right and if there was anything that might change that outlook and maybe the variables that are going into that thesis that you guys were focused on bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah let me just talk about the nii guidance and then how we think about margin and how that connects to it and the variability i think thats a good question so we just made two small changes to our outlook and neither one was very large we took out the  rate cut and reflected the cre payoffs that we saw in  and yes we do view that the margin was really pretty stable this quarter because the decline was really only driven by a denominator effect of the afs portfolio and the trading account so underlying that really the pretty good stability there and we do expect that as the both dda and the deposit rate trends continue to just slow down incrementally even from what we saw in  that that ends up giving us a tailwind on net interest margin percentage plus or minus the usual quartertoquarter noise that you just naturally get but the underlying trend we do see that as up and then on your question of kind of what are the pluses and minuses around how we think about that trajectory it would be certainly positive relative to how were thinking about the nii outlook could be positive if we could get the  rate cut could be positive if we have better loan growth than weve got incorporated in our thinking about that guidance and then on the negative side of cre payoffs end up being higher or the dda or the interest bearing trends dont pan out quite as we expect and those could be really pluses or minuses brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then sticking on guidance i was a little surprised that you didnt tweak down the expense growth for the full year just kind of given the second quarter and just wanted to go back to that line and just see what i know theres obviously probably some inflation on salary in the back half of the year from merit raises but wanted to see if there was anything else in particular that was keeping that midsingledigit number unchanged from the prior guidance martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp well brett keep in mind we did bring down the efficiency ratio guide from last quarter it was and this quarter so id focus on that as you think through the guide i mean we did have a good quarter i would just note that some of the incentive comp declined quarteroverquarter thats not really run rate we should probably had a little bit of that back but we do feel good about being able to have good expense control through the rest of the year now weve got some it projects that are going to bring the data processing line up just a bit brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful appreciate the color operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 hey jon martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i just want to make sure i understand your loan growth guide back on michaels question but i think what youre saying is when i look at the guidance it suggests a pretty consistent pace of net growth from here to get to the middle of the guidance range is that a fair way to look at it scott bradley grauer a executive vice presidentwealth management chief executive officerbok financial securities inc bok financial corp yes i think thats the right way to look at it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp jon and if you go back to january i mean were really outperforming our loan growth expectations from a ci perspective and we said back in january that the real question for us was commercial real estate paydowns we didnt know exactly what was going to happen there and i would still say thats still the case i think were getting closer to the trough there but we dont know if thats second quarter or third quarter in terms of net paydowns there but on the ci side were very optimistic we feel very good about the pipelines there and if it was just cionly guidance that we provided wed probably guide it up a little bit but its the cre uncertainty that really is the headwind in the near term although that will create a tailwind for and as we begin to rebuild that portfolio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah you can sure see that on slide i guess another question would be on the other side on deposits can you talk a little bit more about the drivers of deposit growth this quarter and stacy earlier in your comments you talked about your low loantodeposit ratio so im just curious philosophically how you look at that do you continue to grow deposits faster than loans or do you somehow try to bring that ratio back up over time stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp i answered a couple of ways jon i think one is we typically think about deposits funding the loan book and the securities portfolio is largely selffunded through wholesale fundings and thats the way weve run the bank for bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 most of my career here however we will look for opportunities where we can incrementally fund the securities book cheaper than we can from a wholesale perspective with deposits and so were seeing incremental opportunities to grow the deposits that are incrementally better than wholesale funding and so well continue to do that where it makes sense but i think as you see us where we think were positioned from a growth perspective we want to maintain ample liquidity were comfortable letting that loantodeposit ratio slide up but in the context of other incremental deposit funding opportunities to displace wholesale weve allowed those to continue to happen and to grow and feel good about that were wellpositioned in the marketplace people see us as strong and capable and so thats created opportunities for us and so were continuing to take advantage of that where those opportunities exist for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good afternoon im just wondering on the deposit beta its been at the upperend of peers with the increase in rates but whats the outlook for the downrate beta because it does look like were finally going to get some rate cuts martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah peter and youre right our deposit beta just simply reflects the fact that weve got a more commercial and wealth mix in our deposit base and so you saw the effect when rates went up youre going to see the same effect when rates come down were going to be able to have a deposit beta thats easily in the mid in down rate scenarios were very confident and know exactly how thatll play out so thatll be helpful for us once we start to see rate cuts coming through peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co so would it be in the high you think a downrate beta martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp weve all learned those arent necessarily just linear from the getgo and they stay flat so i think that using something thats in the mid to start with and as rate increases continue that might migrate up its definitely possible i mean higher beta so as rates decline that beta can increase just as we saw on the indiscernible peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 got it and then just on deposits right so periodend deposits they were up yearoveryear in the second quarter certainly a lot stronger than i would have thought but you maintained that deposit outlook for modest growth and just how youre you thinking about deposit growth then in the back half of the year martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp hey peter one thing that you should pay attention to the dda the ending balance of dda was high just customer activity right at the end of the quarter drove that up pay attention to the average balance in dda as youre thinking about looking forward i think thatll help clear up your question stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah thats the right answer peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp you want to focus on averages on the deposit side theres a lot of volatility that happens in any one period so averages are a better way to look at deposits from our perspective peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and just you gave periodend as your guidance but i hear you and then if i could just get one more followup question just the outlook on expenses midsingledigit growth do you exclude the fdic assessment and charitable contributions im just wondering whats the base youre using for martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah so especially when we think about the efficiency ratio were leaving all that in just as it was and i think that the same is true on the growth rate peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co so the growth rate for expenses is really on a reported basis stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thats correct were not normalizing for the special assessment or for the charitable contributions for the whole year efficiency ratio peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 operator our next question comes from the line of woody lay with kbw please go ahead wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey hows it going stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hey wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a quick question on deposits just looking at the deposits broken out by market it looks like you saw really strong growth in your texas markets but on the demand side and interestbearing side and maybe theres some volatility with that between average and periodend but can you just give some color on what youre seeing in the texas markets specifically on deposits stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp if you think of it this is stacy i mean one of our key growth objectives for our company for the last several years has been to grow texas and so you saw us with the expansion in san antonio and on the wealth side were in austin so really the focus on central texas but weve added talent in dallas and fort worth and houston we are very focused on that market and part of how were growing is through deposit acquisition and so youre seeing kind of the fruits of that labor there and clearly from our perspective its something that we expect wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then maybe lastly just shifting over to capital capital remains really strong the buybacks were good to see but obviously weve seen the stock price move up from here just further appetite for buybacks with the current stock price martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah id just note that as you well know were price sensitive in how we think about share buyback our goal is to add shareholder value through that activity and the share buyback that weve done over the past year has been very accretive to shareholder value were very happy about that but with incrementally higher prices you should expect to see us incrementally scale back and have a cooling effect from higher prices wood lay q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thanks for taking my questions stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens inc please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks for taking the question most of mine have been addressed ill just ask about ma weve seen a handful of transactions kind of in or around the footprint would just love somewhat better thoughts around the banks appetite for ma and the opportunities you see in and around your footprint stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah matt weve talked before i mean ma is something that we would be interested in but were going to spend our capital thats going to be for the right opportunity and its really hard to find a type of franchise that would be a good fit with us both culturally which is significantly important but even levels of concentrations in real estate strength in core deposits and things like that you start to run the filter we want to expand outside our footprint we want those strong characteristics of the bank that weve acquired so that we dont have to diminish the value by running loans off that dont fit our profile so the practical answer is theyre just not a lot that really fits the filters that we would look for there and so its unlikely that you would see us do something like that in the near term we do have an appetite but its got to fit our profile for what fits for us matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay makes sense sounds consistent with kind of the past and i guess just lastly on capital if the buyback is potentially less attractive these current valuations it sounds like youd be okay with allowing capital levels to build in the near term or are there other uses of capital we should think about martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah weve got a history of being patient and making sure that were thoughtful about when and where we deploy capital so yeah to continue to recognize that were happy to be patient and watch for the right opportunities matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you matt operator again as a reminder the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi maybe circling back to the line of questioning around deposits maybe if you can quantify just the late quarter inflow into dda and whether the average kind of down is the right way to be thinking about it and maybe just when you see some of those dda pressures starting to abate martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah timur i think an easy way to think about that is the  average for dda was billion the june average was almost exactly the same number so weve really seen a nice leveling off of activity there and while we may not be exactly at the bottom were feeling pretty good about just the trajectory weve seen really since february timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just looking at bond cash flows and reinvestments kind of with all the work being done on the bond book can you give us a sense of where those yields ended the quarter kind of whats the bond yield looking like in given both the reinvestment opportunities and some of the restructuring activities martin e grunst a chief financial officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah i think if you look at the average yield for the bond portfolio in  i mean thats fairly representative because the restructuring activity that was all right at the end of  so  was fairly clean and so probably the important thing to think about is were still getting like million average a quarter this quarter was million but kind of durably million a quarter of cash flows that get reinvested each quarter and this quarter we were able to gain basis points between what the cash flows came off at and what we were able to reinvest in and so that trend will just keep continuing and thats going to be an important driver of margin expansion over the coming multiple quarters timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then just last for me your comments around uncertainty just with cre paydowns i guess that messaging has been a little bit mixed throughout the industry but im just wondering whats driving the elevated paydowns in your book is your maybe cre exposure a little bit insulated from what were seeing in other geographies and other asset classes or i guess what are the categories that are driving the payoff activity and im wondering if theres anything lumpier in the backend of the year that might be driving indiscernible bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp its really just a function of we have a portfolio that largely starts with construction and once there is a level of occupancy that it can be refinanced in the permanent noncourse market it is and thats whats happening so marc in his prepared comments talked about its going to lifecos its going to cmbs its going to agency permanent nonrecourse financing and thats the way that portfolios work its just slower to rebuild behind it is some of those borrowers that we have are slower to start the new project are being a little bit more cautious and so the rebuild behind that but the portfolio paydowns is really very healthy and very typical of our portfolio you just dont have the advances that are kind of offsetting that today that i think youll see in future periods as more confidence around this sector begins to emerge timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the color operator that concludes our qa session i will now turn the call back over to stacy kymes for closing
