call bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 ill now turn the call over to steve bradshaw steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter financial results this quarter was another in which our diversified revenue strategy was a key differentiator for us as we grew pretax preprovision earnings by on a linked quarter basis and eclipsed million in net income for the first time in the history of our company shown on slide second quarter net income was a record million or per diluted share that represents growth in net income of nearly from last quarter and a result of our longterm commitment to our balanced earnings model and our breadth of business capabilities the key items that drove our success this quarter were another outstanding contribution from our feebased business units with total fees and commissions up million or from last quarter the contribution from our wealth management team continues to be a differentiator for us offsetting narrowing margins and housing inventory constraints that impacted our mortgage company this quarter net interest revenue stabilized as a similar amount of ppp forgiveness was recognized again this quarter as it was in  additionally deposit costs reduction outpaced rate compression on loan yields and in our available for sale portfolio the increasingly favorable economic outlook combined with improving credit trends allowed us to release million of our loan loss reserve and lastly expense management remains excellent with total expenses relatively flat linked quarter when you exclude the million charitable contribution we made in the first quarter that did not reoccur in the second quarter turning to slide total loans are down billion for the quarter but ppp loan forgiveness accounts for million of that contraction core loan growth did remain a challenge this quarter as our energy and commercial real estate customers continue to paydown debt or refinance in longterm markets that said we saw stable loan balances in our core ci book stacys going to cover that momentarily which reaffirm our belief that we are poised for growth opportunities as the economy continues to rebound average deposits were up nearly this quarter and nearly from the same quarter a year ago as the growth trend weve seen there for the past months continues assets under management or in custody in our wealth management business were also up they were up in this quarter ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill just now turn the call over to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp thanks steve turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion down just under for the quarter as we continue to see borrowers in some specialty winning areas continue to reduce leverage that said certain areas of portfolio saw increasing pipelines and real growth that outpaced paydowns energy balances continue to decline albeit at a slower pace than in previous periods bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 both oil and natural gas prices have moved up swiftly in leading to improved credit metrics and providing material cash flow for energy companies us rig counts are moving up very modestly and are just a little over half of what they were before the pandemic as we move into the fall when capital budgets are established i suspect we will begin to see more drilling activity if prices remain near current levels this would organically increase loan demand ancillary business from hedging investment banking and treasury were all very good for this segment this quarter healthcare balances grew this quarter driven by our senior housing sector looking forward we remain very confident in our ability to perform both from a growth and credit standpoint in this portfolio as it remains a leader for us core middle market ci today is at the lowest level of utilization as any measured period back to march of which shows we have capacity to move up as demand starts to come back online without it being predicated on new customer acquisition overall seeing the broad ci portfolio begin to stabilize is a real positive coming out of this quarter and bodes well for our outlook for returning loan growth later this year and in the next year commercial real estate balance has contracted this quarter we continue to see borrowers use this low rate environment to refinance to the longterm fixed rate nonrecourse market was one of the real estates lowest years for portfolio turnover as many of the permanent markets were cautious as hose have opened back up we see some catch up activity thats inherently a sign of a healthy portfolio but can create some quartertoquarter volatility ppp loan balance forgiveness was substantial this quarter with million forgiven shrinking the portfolio by nearly we expect to have another period of forgiveness activity early in the third quarter from the vintage of ppp before it slows in the remainder of looking ahead we remain positioned well for loan growth later this year and next year when economic activity creates borrowing needs for working capital we are hopeful the stability in our ci book this quarter signals we are turning the corner on loan demand in our core markets turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to improve as we move further out from the pandemic we saw meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio with nonperforming assets and potential problem loans both down significantly this quarter these factors coupled with the rebound in commodity prices to multiyear highs and strong economic forecasts for gdp growth and labor markets led us to release million in reserves this quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points annualized excluding ppp loans in the second quarter thats essentially flat from last quarters million net chargeoffs averaged basis points over the last four trailing quarters which is at the lower end of our historic loss range as we look forward to the latter half of we expect net chargeoffs to be at or modestly better than the result of the first half of this year the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at quarter end excluding the ppp loans nonaccruing loans decreased million from last quarter primarily due to a reduction in nonaccruing energy loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarter end down significantly from million on march potential problem energy services and general business loans all decreased compared to the prior quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 we will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have we are generally positive about the credit outlook for the remainder of the year future allowance levels will be impacted by economic activity commodity prices asset quality and loan growth turning to slide you can see that our wealth management team had another outstanding quarter total wealth management revenues were million up nearly from the previous quarter this includes the fee income lines that investors see in our corporate income statement brokerage and trading and fiduciary and asset management as well as net interest income from loans and deposits in our private wealth group and net interest income generated as part of our brokerage and trading group banking products and services for private wealth clients continue to be a particular area to highlight the total loan portfolio bordering on billion grew linkedquarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago the deposit portfolio ending the quarter at billion grew linkedquarter and was up compared to the same quarter a year ago total net interest income also saw strong growth in this quarter up total brokerage and trading revenues increased million or linkedquarter this is largely due to a shift in product strategy this quarter in our institutional trading and sales business coupled with adding new financial institution clients importantly as we look forward we believe the revenue from this shift in product focus and expanded customer base is sustainable in the third quarter before modest seasonal declines as you get into the fourth quarter also in the wealth management space fiduciary and asset management fees were up nearly linkedquarter as well as from the same quarter a year ago a portion of the linkedquarter growth is due to the annual tax fees that are charged in the second quarter but we still saw a strong growth in assets under management and we have seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances sales activity remains strong in this base as well our relationshipdriven business model is perfectly in touch with the clients needs today as we continue to see institutions and individuals retain the increased appreciation for financial advice gained through the last months transaction card revenue was up million or this quarter this is largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of the us economy as we saw both merchant and atm transaction volumes increase this quarter deposit service charges were up million or nearly this quarter primarily centered in our commercial businesses lower earnings credit rates due to lower interest rates resulted in higher service charges this quarter mortgage banking revenue decreased million linkedquarter due to the broader economic factors currently impacting the industry increasing average mortgage interest rates in particular were a factor this quarter as that moved the mix between refi and purchase funding from refi last quarter to refi this quarter industrywide housing inventory constraints and the recent preferred stock purchase agreement delivery limits on second homes and investment properties imposed on fannie and freddie both impacted the quarter in addition to volume the increased competition for inventory impacted gain on sale margins which were closer to pre pandemic levels this quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 we expected mortgage revenues to dip this year due to changing environment but our mortgage team is doing a good job managing the transition to a purchased market we are better positioned than most of our nonbank competitors as the market shifts to more of a home purchase financing while this quarters contribution was down from the record levels we saw throughout the past year the rate pressure did ease as the quarter unfolded we still expect this business to be a significant contributor to our diversified fee revenue strategy going forward although not included on slide i will also note that the net economic hedges in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges were a positive million during the quarter other revenue increased million this quarter due to higher production level from repossessed oil and gas properties which was largely offset by increased operating expenses looking forward this level of revenue and expense will diminish as these properties are sold ill now turn over the call to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide second quarter net interest revenue was million largely unchanged compared to last quarter average earning assets decreased million compared to the first quarter and average loan balances decreased million available for sale securities decreased million as we continue to reinvest most of the quarterly cash flows from the portfolio average trading securities grew by million to support our brokerage and trading business noninterest deposits grew million this quarter which also helped support net interest income net interest margin was down just basis points from the previous quarter the reinvestment of cash flows from our available for sale securities portfolio was stable this quarter due to prepayments from commercial mortgagebacked securities however the expectation is that there will be continued supply pressure due to a reinvestment of this lowrate environment additionally we had continued success driving interestbearing deposit costs down basis points to basis points on average for the quarter ppp loans supported net interest margin by basis points this quarter unchanged from last quarter there are many moving parts to consider but we believe the extensive pressure felt on net interest margin since early is beginning to wane we think we could be nearing a bottom in net interest margin but do not expect any positive migration there until rates begin to rise again with sooner than anticipated rate hikes now potentially on the horizon its important to recall how well we performed during the last rate hike cycle from to in the top quartile of regional banks while we cant be assured to repeat that experience we dont see much that would lead us to believe the experience will be significantly different in fact there is even more liquidity in the system today than before the last increased cycle which should diminish the need for the market to move rates up quickly turning to slide expense management remains prudent with total expenses down linked quarter personnel expense was essentially flat this quarter a regular compensation decrease of million was mostly offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense all told we are very happy with our ability to hold the personnel cost efficiencies earned through the pandemic and expect to do so going forward bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 nonpersonnel expense was down million this quarter mortgage banking costs decreased million due to the decrease in prepayments combined with lower accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs and loan service for others data processing and communication expense decreased million as a result of reduction of system conversion expenses other expense increased million primarily due to increased operating expense on repossessed assets also of note last quarter we made a million charitable contribution to our bokf foundation that did not reoccur this quarter on slide our liquidity position remains very strong our loantodeposit ratio declined from nearly last quarter to just over at june largely due to the significant decline in ppp balances this quarter this significant on balance sheet liquidity leaves us very wellpositioned to meet future customer needs our capital position levels remain strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating minimum with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchase optimistically repurchasing nearly  at an average price of per share in the open market one additional thing of note is that we plan to redeem our million subordinated debt issue in june of using existing capital given the strength of our capital levels we have decided not to reissue this debt this will impact only the total capital ratio at the holding company level by basis points but will save the company approximately million annually on a goforward basis on slide ill leave you with some general outlook for the near and mid term we believe net activity and loan growth will continue to improve with our company positioned for positive growth in the second half of the year if borrower demand exists we expect the overall loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances to continue to migrate towards prepandemic levels net interest margin may continue to move down slightly largely from continued downward repricing in our available for sale securities portfolio we believe we are close to the bottom in our interestbearing deposit pricing at basis points that said we believe the significant pressure on net interest margin seen in past quarters is largely behind us now our diverse portfolio of fee revenue streams should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue pressure being felt in our spread businesses we expect most fee revenue categories to grow modestly for the remainder of we will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and nonpersonnel costs with growth budgeted at lowsingle digits in our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing multiyear technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength we will continue looking for share buyback opportunities and plan to maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven as i mentioned at the top of the call it was another exceptional quarter for bok financial we continue to do the right things in the right way for the benefit of our longterm investors adding shareholder value without compromising credit discipline or foregoing investment that might hinder the companys future and as witnessed by our credit outcomes and the outsized wealth management contribution this quarter we continue to do that in a prudent diversified way bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 while this quarter was once again about the contribution from our feebased businesses the vastly improving outlook for growth in our footprint as we emerge from the pandemic is driving customer confidence in a way we havent seen for quite some time while supply chain and workforce disruptions might be hampering some areas in the near term economic indicators remain strong which portends well for the future with growth returning to our healthcare book this quarter and pipelines returning to prepandemic levels in other areas as ci we are very optimistic about the restart of some of our largest growth drivers in the company additionally we were pleased to welcome back our remote workers this quarter and believe that the energy and teamwork thats core to our company will also play a role in our growth expectations in the second half of the year with that were pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator and at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks good morning i wanted to ask about the loan growth obviously some trends are improving but it seems like theres still some pressure on loan growth and im just wondering if you could talk about the third quarter because it does seem like average loans could still be down in the third quarter im just wondering if you could talk about some of the puts and takes stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp peter this is stacy i think the story for us as you think about the second quarter and then going to the third quarter was really stability in our core ci book weve had growth in our wealth lending platform for a while now and that was a real strong story for this quarter and we think that will continue into next year but if we can get past the paydowns in energy and commercial real estate i think youre going to see that core ci begin to grow as we get into the latter half of this year we actually saw it in may were hoping we could string two months together and then have something really fun to talk about this quarter but we backed up a little bit in ci in the month of june so but were we really reached the point where those balances are real stable at this point were seeing months where we pop up and have some poor growth in the ci energy paydowns its hard to know when weve reached the bottom there i think were awfully close but weve worked through a lot of the issues there from a credit perspective that have created some of the paydown activity those borrowers are flush with cash flow with prices much higher than what they would have budgeted at as we go into the fall thats typically when ep companies do their capital budgeting i think that at these price levels youre going to see more drilling activity which will create more demand on the energy side commercial real estates a little bit of a different story weve had real consistent loan generation there even through the downturn but the capital markets in many respects were closed last year with covid and so a lot bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 of those stabilized properties that can move to the permanent nonrecourse side of things have done that and so its created some paydowns that created some lumpiness and when we looked at the quarter and how it was unfolding i mean really the story for us was the ci balances were very stable that it was really the headwind from energy and commercial real estate which we think if its not behind us its very close to being behind us but when you talk to the core ci guys about their pipelines about what theyre seeing about the borrower optimism i cant remember a time when borrowers have been more optimistic about economic growth and thats going to create organic demand but i think were close were optimistic about the latter half of this year certainly optimistic about next year in terms of the ability to grow that core ci portfolio we mentioned in the prepared remarks about utilization rates utilization rates in our corporate are the lowest weve seen in a long long time so as we begin to get borrower need for capital thats going to have an opportunity to grow and create organic demand as well so when the market provides the opportunity to grow i think were going to get our share or disproportionate share because of how wellpositioned we are peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats really helpful very helpful if i could switch gears about the securities portfolio steven average securities were down this quarter and i just assume with rates even lower not really a lot of interest moving excess cash into securities i was just wondering if you could talk about the outlook for the securities and if youre planning on replacing maturing securities steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp we are peter well still have around million i would say in cash flows off of the afs portfolio each quarter and our plan is to continue to reinvest that now rates have moved down a little bit here but well continue to look for opportunities the quarter was down i think million i think that was just timing really theres no particular strategy to move that balance down i think we want to continue to reinvest those cash flows on a goforward basis and keep the portfolio relatively level around that billion to billion kind of range in the afs portfolio peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and what are new yields going on at today steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp roughly peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great okay thanks for taking my questions bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp sure operator our next question is from jennifer demba with truist please proceed with your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey this is brandon king on for jennifer demba good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hi good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah so i wanted to touch on deposit growth i saw average balances were up in the quarter but on a period end basis balances were down a little bit and i want to just know what was going on there if there are any seasonal factors to note of and what is the expectation for deposit growth for the second half of the year stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp sure i think one the entire industry is seeing enormous liquidity in the system and weve certainly benefited from that enormous deposit growth for us yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter i think if you start to look at period end numbers you get a lot of fluctuation between deposit balances and things that happen there we have a lot of customers who have benefited from stimulus funds that have come in over the course of the first half of the year those will go back out those are going back out weve had some energy customers whove done things where weve had an influx of cash for a period of time that goes back out to some place other than the balance sheet and so really the focus for us is kind of the average balances because that really is more representative of kind of the core growth there i think if we knew the answer to what deposit balances were going to do in thatd be a helpful thing for all of us i think the industry is going to struggle with that as we begin to formulate plans for specifically we have so much liquidity in the system today its beyond what any of us have experienced in our career and so the timing of when that begins to flow back out into investment or out of consumers pockets as the stimulus continues to impact them as well is a fair question to ask and i dont think our crystal ball is much different than anybody elses i mean it clearly will begin to go probably not as fast as we think that it will it tends to be stickier this time last year third quarter fourth quarter we were predicting a lot of those deposit balances would move out of the banking system that hasnt happened the system has grown and we certainly have grown as well and were not paying above a market rate for sure to be able to do that its just kind of organic relationship driven deposits there bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and i know the loan to deposit ratio is sub50 now and i know this is hard to gauge based off how you just answered my previous question but are you hopeful that loan growth could outpace deposit growth later this year and into next year is that the thought stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp i think if you look at our company i mean weve typically been kind of closer to loantodeposit ratio overtime and i think what happens when you get the economy moving again that youre going to have both sides of the equation youre going to have loan growth and youre going to have deposit outflows and the result of that is going to be a loantodeposit ratio thats probably much more reflective of our history than the current period is and so clearly the opportunity for thats going to create positive momentum around earnings one of the things that steven alluded to in his remarks i think thats very important is how wellpositioned we think we are when the fed does begin to move i think theres a lot of net interest revenue that will come back into the forefront theres a lot of fee revenue in scotts wealth world that will come back into the forefront whenever rates begin to move a little bit and theres been a lot of analysis that weve seen that kind of seems to focus on how everybody is modeling an increasing rate environment when that day does come and i think from our perspective weve been through that i think the actual results are probably a better indicator of the future than how everybodys models are working because theres so many different assumptions that go into that and so we would ask the community investment community to really focus on who performed well the last time there was an increasing rate cycle and i think youll find that we performed exceptionally well and have pinup earnings that will show up once rates begin to move brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats all i have for now thanks for answering my questions operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so we have talked about or you guys have talked about ci utilization rates being still pretty low can you just tell us what that percentage is in the quarter and then what a more normalized level would be stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp the core ci was below and if you look at kind of the history in that segment something closer to to and even thats a little bit misleading because youre a lot of our core ci is borrowing base driven with accounts receivable and inventory so those borrowing bases those commitment levels can increase and decrease depending upon inventory and receivable levels which so its not a perfect applestoapples because i think youll see those commitments increase as well once not just utilization increase but the commitments will organically increase once kind of a more normal economic environment exists so i think theres a lot of organic opportunity im not downplaying the customer acquisition process because were very focused on that but i think theres a lot of it of built up loan growth that will show up on the balance sheet once the national economy kind of looks normal again brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then on the buyback its great to see some buyback this quarter the stock is cheaper today than kind of where you guys bought it back in the second quarter so should we expect a step up in the buyback as you guys potentially get a little more aggressive and you have excess capital the stock is cheap should we expect more buybacks going forward steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah well be active i dont know if well end up spending the million or million that we did like we did this quarter but i we do have the capacity we stay opportunistic with it scott and i work together on a daily basis to figure out what were going to do and i think well be active as we were in the second quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me we havent talked about any accretable yield levels from cobiz is in the last couple quarters is that down to a pretty small amount that its not even worth mentioning or whats the cobiz accretable yield level nowadays steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so in the first quarter of it was million and this quarter it was million and we have about million remaining of accretable yield that will come in over the course of couple of years i would say brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you guys bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 operator our next question is from gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning i just wanted to kind of revisit the discussion about the loan growth outlook my interpretation of your comments on whats in the deck kind of suggest that the outlook for the back half of the year may be a bit more modest than youd previously expressed is that a fair interpretation from what were hearing today stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp i dont think so i mean i think what were trying to communicate is that seeing stability and even some modest growth from in some of the months interquarter inside of ci was a real positive for us and the total loan growth headwind was really driven by kind of specific factors inside of energy where they are have a higher level of cash flow than what they would have anticipated probably when they were setting their budgets and plans and higher level of capital markets activity within our commercial real estate portfolio its hard to predict when an energy customer is going to begin to drill and quit paying down debt or when borrowers will not use the third party or the publics nonrecourse financing markets i think absent those headwinds i think you would have begun to see some real positive growth there were seeing good new customer acquisition inside of energy today and we were continuing to originate a good pace inside of our commercial real estate area healthcare showed a good loan growth this quarter and so i think that its just hard to tell you with great certainty what quarter is going to show the loan growth but the underlying activity that you would expect to see so that that would make you think its certainly close were seeing and im optimistic were going to see that but i dont i cant tell you that its going to be the third quarter or the fourth quarter or in july it certainly seems like were awfully close and the biggest thing to me was the real core stability in those ci balances and in fact we were up a little bit in may down a little bit in june but very stable there which we saw as a real positive going into the end of the quarter gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thank you and then just on the capital front you talked about the buyback a few minutes ago just in terms of kind of the target capital ratios can you just remind us kind of where you would like to optimize the cet1 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i like where they are today at that roughly or a little bit lower i dont have any kind of idea that its going to move lower than that i think we have sufficient capital and continue to pay a competitive dividend to be in the market as i mentioned earlier on actively in the market on buyback and well have i think plenty of capital that well build to support loan growth that comes back so i dont see a pulldown in the capital ratios i think they stay relatively level bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thank you operator and our next question is from matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning guys i want to circle back on the ppp i think youve mentioned that ppp fees in were similar to the levels steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matt olney q analyst stephens inc whats the dollar amount of this i cant find that in my notes from last steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well the first im sorry the first quarter ppp fees were million and in the second quarter it was million the interest that we recorded net interest revenue on the ppp dollars was million in the first quarter and about million in the second quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp so youll continue to see that taper obviously as those balances are forgiven or pay out over the course of their term matt olney q analyst stephens inc and steven whats the remaining dollar amount of those fees to be recognized steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think theres million remaining matt olney q analyst stephens inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 okay thank you and then i guess switching over to the mortgage side i guess in we saw it impacted by both volume and gain on sale margin headwinds do you think were in a bottom here in or you think we could continue to bleed lower from here stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp well theres seasonality embedded in mortgage and so i think third quarter tends to be a good quarter second quarter and third quarter tend to be your better quarters there and i think well have a better quarter in the third quarter i think now the fourth quarter would be different depending on the rate environment and theres seasonality that moves against you a little bit in the fourth quarter there but i think its relative to second quarter i would expect third quarter to be similar or better and frankly a little bit better based on kind of what were seeing early in the quarter and believe will transpire there obviously rates make a big difference there but weve seen some backup there in rates which will help weve seen some changes around the adverse fee that the agencies were charging should help i mean theres some things that are creating a bit of a modest tailwind for the third quarter in addition to some positive seasonality impacts that will happen there as well matt olney q analyst stephens inc and i think the press release mentioned that the realized gain on sale margin was around which was obviously higher than steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matt olney q analyst stephens inc the yeah are you trying to signal this is more of a longerterm or more of an intermediateterm level we should think about for our forecast stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp the gain on sale margin is awfully influenced by what the pipeline looks like and whether youre building a pipeline or whether its net over net declining and so i think what we are signaling the broader is that margins last year and early this year were much wider than what is typical for the industry i think that everybody was managing the pipeline if you will in a manner that widened the margins i think youre seeing margins coming down as rates began to go up and thats what were signaling is that margins are not where they were pre pandemic but that they are moving in that direction matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you operator and our next question is from jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared maybe starting on asset sensitivity if i remember correctly during the last cycle bok employed hedges to remain somewhat assetneutral is that a similar environment or a similar strategy thats going to be employed in the future raising rate cycle with the kicker just being added liquidity in the system or i guess if you could just maybe provide some color on how youre positioning the bank heading into the net rising rate environment steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i mean i think as stacy said we were assetsensitive coming out of the last cycle and we dont really see any reason to believe wed be much different i mean our modeling is hard to compare to other banks but we think were kind of middle of the pack frankly and youll see some numbers when we come out with our 10q i dont know exactly where theyll land but i think well be somewhere around assetsensitive and thats on our calculation and our model i think in the last cycle we actually outperformed that a little bit but im not predicting that will happen but i dont see any reason to believe that itll be a lot different than it was coming out of the last nearzero rate environment stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp and in fact theres an opportunity to even outperform our strong performance last time when rates went up because i think theres more inherent liquidity in the system today and so the banks overall are not going to feel as compelled to move rates up as quickly once the fed starts to move on shortterm rates and so i think that will allow the industry overall to lag deposit rates perhaps even more than they did in the last time that rates went up so i continue to focus on actual results because theres a nearterm period where you guys can go back and look at how did banks actually perform the last time rates went up and i think thats a better indicator of the future than everybodys varied assumptions around deposit modeling and so i think thats what i would certainly continue to point people to timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then if i can just have one more followup on the loan growth commentary looking specifically at your energy customers and the confidence that balances could start heading up in the back end of the year i guess just given how much liquidity your borrowers have as well and the fact that energy customers are still paying down debt and refinancing i guess what gives you confidence that when the capital budgets are established later this year that borrowers are going to choose to lever up and borrow to drive that growth rather than digging into their own pockets for at least the initial period stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp well i think theyre savvy financial people a modest amount of leverage can enhance the return of their capital investment and so thats been the case for a long time and so i think that well i believe that well begin to see bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 that i mean you look out on the hedging curve its backwarddated but you can still hedge above for sure out almost three years and so i think youre going to see folks begin to look at hey i can lock in my cash flow i know what its going to cost me to drill and i know how much im of that im going to get back in that first three years because i can hedge at that level im very optimistic our energy team is exceptionally strong theres not a bank in the us that i would trade our team for and were seeing lots of opportunities there and were going to get our disproportionate share because we remain very committed to this space and its core to who we are its a big part of the economic development of our footprint states in colorado texas and oklahoma and we have every expectation to grow energy in the latter half of this year and into next year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay then just finally for me more of a modeling question but looking at trading securities balances period end versus average average balance was a couple billion higher than periodend can you just talk to the dynamics there and is that something where balances are higher during the entire yeartoquarter and then then dip down towards the end and how should we expect that to impact nii in the coming quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so yes we allow those trading balances to be on average a little bit higher during the quarter we did that intentionally to take advantage of the market and allow scott and the traders in that group to generate some revenue i dont think you see those average balances go up really any higher than that i think theyre around billion and were comfortable with that level but we always look at the market we look at the opportunities we look at the balance sheet and we decide how much capital we want to allocate towards businesses this particular quarter we allowed a little bit more in terms of the balance sheet that that group could use and reap the benefit of that so well evaluate that every quarter but i dont see it going to much higher on average than that billion scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah and this is scott so as steven mentioned we finished just under billion so about billion and thats versus a billion previous quarter and its kind of moderated since so i think thats a level that we feel pretty good about i wouldnt look for that to increase as we move forward stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp but i think the big takeaway from that for us is we had a really strong quarter there and we believe that we can sustain that in the third quarter that as we think about the product mix and the customers that weve added we think that thats a level that we can sustain into the third quarter now theres some seasonality in the fourth quarter that will impact that but certainly we think we can sustain that level of revenue into the third quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 okay great thank you for the questions operator and our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp hi steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey steven question for you just on how you want us to think about the provision talking about migrating to pre pandemic reserve levels is that are you flagging day cecl as the benchmark for us is there something else going on there steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i think thats right i mean in that million to million range was pretty much day cecl thats kind of prepandemic level so i guess were using those two terms and then in the same light i think we migrate that direction so long as the economy continues to improve were very comfortable with our credit quality it continues to get better all of the metrics internally from potential problem loans nonaccruals classified criticized all those areas continue to decline chargeoffs are right at the lowerend of the historical levels and dont really see any change in all of that so and if you get loan growth added to it the mix then i do think we migrate the percentage downward i think were at on a combined reserve when you exclude ppp and that migrates i dont know how long that it takes well just have to see but year year and a half who knows well migrate that direction we believe jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah you got my next question so i appreciate that thats its open ended but i guess another one weve talked of a lot about lines of business in terms of growth are there any differences geographically in terms of what youre seeing on in terms of optimism or reopenings may be the wrong term for your geography but any differences that youre seeing stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 no not that theyre apparent and i think that the same dynamics that exist in kansas city are similar to what is in dallas i mean if you think about just our geographic footprint overall well weve got a great footprint for long term economic growth if you think about texas and colorado and arizona awfully wellpositioned in those states that are going to have disproportionate economic growth we think over the next years so but in terms of the near term theres nothing different that we see in the markets themselves jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay stacy competitive environment in energy has that changed at all and people really pulled back are you seeing new entrants come back in stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp were not seeing a lot of new entrants at this point i mean all the discussion about loan growth and everybodys seeking that i mean i think at some point youre going to have some folks relook at that and come back in but clearly were seeing good opportunity for us to lead deals we think about energy from a lending perspective but theres probably not another segment that we have a fuller revenue suite than in energy where weve seen our investment banking dollars go up our syndication revenue go up our hedging revenue go up i mean our customer portfolio is the best hedged that ive ever seen into my career here and theyre doing a lot of that business with us and so from a full business perspective thats been a and continues to be a wonderful business for us were not seeing some of the folks who left come back yet you may but clearly were seeing opportunities and were being rewarded for our consistency in this space jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc one last one i hate to ask it but it and i ask this respectfully but how do you guys answer the esg question i know theres a lot of subjectivity to it but how do you think through that and for the public stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp sure jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc record how should we think through it stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp i mean because there are a couple of things most of the esg analysis that happens today is kind of at the corporate level so what are we doing from an environmental what is bokf doing from an environmental perspective not necessarily what are your customers doing and that is where esg is today for the most part bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 but certainly as it evolves therell be more in terms of what your customers are doing but as we think about esg in our relationship to energy you think about it a couple different ways number one we exist in large respect to provide capital to help those in our state do well so if you think about where our footprint is energy is a big part of that in colorado texas and oklahoma but one of the most expensive taxes on people in lower income brackets is energy and so an inexpensive source of energy that exist with oil and natural gas is clearly a positive and if youve been and i have been if youve been on rigs with folks who work in the permian or some of those areas they hunt and fish on those same lands that theyre drilling on they care deeply about the environment that theyre drilling on and so this will evolve i think that a lot of the technology that we think about with respect to energy will also impact carbonbased energy so whether its methane capture technology or things like that i think that were a long way away from peak carbon demand if you will to propel the domestic economy and theres a place for that and were happy to provide capital to those who help produce that for our country jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc
