steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results the fourth quarter concluded a second consecutive record year for bok financial both from a net income and an earnings per share perspective for the full year net income was million up over from diluted earnings per share were for that compares to last year was a broadbased earnings year with significant expansion of our fee businesses and continued strength in our specialty lending channels while we also had accelerated growth in our core deposit franchise additionally saw us achieve our business integration and financial goals for our acquisition of cobiz which will help drive momentum in two of our most critical highgrowth markets going forward looking at the fourth quarter specifically net income was million or per diluted share down from our record third quarter but up from the same quarter a year ago and as a reminder we closed on cobiz at the start of the fourth quarter of so the like quarter comparison is appropriate fee and commission revenue was up yearoveryear though seasonal slowdowns in mortgage volumes along with slightly lower consumer service charges left our fee and commission revenue down from the previous quarter expense management remains prudent though expenses did increase this quarter due to elevated severance expenses as we worked to rightsize our business units heading into coupled with our annual charitable contribution to the bok foundation sic bokf foundation which provides support to many nonprofit partners in the communities that we serve our loan loss provision was million this quarter due to some migration in our energy portfolio and stacy will cover that in more detail here in a moment turning to slide average loans were billion thats up yearoveryear though down from last quarter due to general paydowns in energy and commercial real estate and two anticipated large yearend paydowns in our ci portfolio having said that we feel good about our pipeline opportunity in the early start here in average deposits were up from the previous year and up over on a linkedquarter basis even with the strong growth this quarter we were able to bring overall interestbearing deposit costs down from in the third quarter to in the fourth quarter growing deposits to fund loan growth was a significant area of emphasis for bok up in and you can see that in our results this focus will continue into allowing us to fund future loan growth assets under management or in custody were up over for the quarter and more than yearoveryear strong sales activity coupled with favorable equity markets were really the key drivers of that expansion and we saw an opportunity to further invest in our company at a favorable price this quarter as we bought back bokf shares at per share in the open market ill provide additional perspective on the results at the conclusion of our remarks but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio and credit in more detail ill turn the call over now to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 thanks steve as you can see on slide periodend loans were billion down more than for the quarter while paydowns impacted our quarter end numbers was a growth year for bokf from a loan perspective up on average yearoveryear total ci expanded nearly in though paydowns in our two largest growth engines energy and healthcare left total ci down linked quarter energy had a fantastic year in growing nearly while the segment was down million for the quarter the trends in the industry weve discussed remain true and pipelines remain full i expect our energy growth to return to a positive level as we head into our healthcare channel also had an exceptional growing over though the quarter was flat steady growth in commitment levels and our expertise in the senior housing space bodes well for another great year for healthcare in a slowdown in general ci seems to point to increased cautiousness in the general middle market business community tariffs trade disputes and the questions that arise heading into a new election cycle seems to have caused pause for some of our clients future clarity around the regulatory trade and economic environment should help reenergize the middle market segment continued discipline around concentration limits in commercial real estate coupled with latequarter paydowns left the segment down for the quarter commitment volume is still solid in this space and well continue to highgrade through stringent customer selection as we manage the portfolio on slide you can see that credit quality overall remains good nonaccruing loans increased million this quarter primarily due to million increase in a nonaccruing community development credit net chargeoffs were million or basis points on an annualized basis up from million or basis points in the previous quarter all relatively consistent with what we have seen over the past months potential problem loans which are defined as performing loans that based on known information caused management concern as to the borrowers ability to continue to perform totaled million at december up from million at september this increase largely comes from the energy portfolio as the capital markets environment is requiring certain customers to work through their liquidity needs this situation may lead to additional nonaccruals and some impairments however as weve discussed previously our senior secured collateral position should protect us from material loss content based on evaluation of all credit factors including changes in nonaccruing and potential problem loans as well as specific impairments of two shared national energy credits which we are not the lead agent the company determined that a million provision for credit losses was appropriate for the fourth quarter of ill turn the call over to steven now to cover the income statement in more detail steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy as noted on slide net interest income for the quarter was million down million from the third quarter as the full realization of the last two federal reserve interest rate cuts were felt in the quarter net interest margin was down from the previous quarter i have provided on the slide a roll forward to highlight significant items impacting the nim calculation first accretion levels were million less this quarter due to the lower cobiz loan payoffs which reduced nim by basis points second higher loan fees in the fourth quarter improved nim by basis points third there was a basis point decline in our noninterestbearing funding profile with a decrease in demand deposits and an bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 increase in receivables from our trading activity in addition our earning asset yield decline excluding accretion and fees of basis points was effectively offset by a basis point decline in funding cost while net interest income and margin have moved down over the past few quarters the projected flat interest rate environment in should allow some stability going forward on slide fees and commissions were million an increase of quarterly yearoveryear fueled largely by strength in our brokerage and trading business brokerage and trading increased over from the same quarter a year ago while overall brokerage and trading was relatively flat in the quarterly comparisons growth in trading revenue was up million but was offset by lower customer hedging revenue and loan syndication fees mortgage banking revenue was down from an expected seasonal slowdown however was a great year for the mortgage channel as the favorable rate environment allowed us to grow the business compared to as we enter we remain confident in our origination capabilities even in an expected flat rate environment fiduciary and asset management revenue was up over linked quarter and yearoveryear as strong sales gathering activities and favorable equity markets had fueled steady growth other revenue was down due to the variable nature of repossessed asset revenues from certain oil and gas properties that are contained in that line item turning to slide total operating expenses increased million to million personnel expense increased million for the quarter incentive compensation increased million linked quarter due to an increase in cashbased incentive compensation primarily from the sales activity and wealth management and commercial banking regular compensation increased million largely due to the severance cost from a realignment of personnel for the operating environment headed into nonpersonnel expense was up million from the third quarter largely due to our typical yearend charitable contribution to the bokf foundation of million the mentioned pressure on net interest revenues moved our efficiency ratio back over this quarter while a or lower efficiency ratio is still our longterm goal it will be influenced by the mix of revenue going forward slide has our current outlook for average security balances remain comparable to current levels as we manage to a relatively neutral interest rate risk position average loan growth around to with lower growth in energy compared to average deposits are expected to cover loan growth for the year net interest revenue is expected to remain relatively flat compared to given overall lower interest rates for the year stable net interest margin from the current level with a bias towards slight improvement if the overall minute interest rate environment remains flat fee revenues grow midsingle digits with continued growth in brokerage and trading and assets under management and wealth efficiency ratio is slightly above as fee revenues grow faster than net interest revenue day two cecl provision levels will provide for loan growth and will be influenced by changing economic outlook we are not expecting any meaningful changes in the historic loss rates during that drive our models tax rate approximately of pretax income we will continue to provide sufficient capital for loan and balance sheet growth a competitive dividend payment and a modest level of opportunistic share repurchases capital ratios are expected to improve slightly over the course of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 and lastly i want to share the updated transition impact of cecl that we expect to book on day one after many test runs we expect the pretax transition adjustment to range between million and million which is in the middle of the range we provided last quarter we have elected to phase in the impact of cecl transition on regulatory capital over a threeyear period ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven was an outstanding year for the organization and one thats really a testament to the diversity of our revenue model proved more challenging for the industry as a whole compared to as we faced some pretty significant revenue headwinds when interest rates moved lower starting in midyear while this pressure typically contracts the earnings potential of regional financial institutions we saw a strong surge in revenue from our feebased business units that performed exceedingly well when rates decline this was no accident we are purposefully built to perform under any economic cycle and though we remain optimistic in our ability to continue to grow our business in the headwinds of lower rates and the economic uncertainty thats always exaggerated in a national election year may well prove challenging however we have always taken a longterm approach to building shareholder value and that focus will continue to guide our decisions on how and where we invest in the company going forward with that were very pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting the questionandanswer operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc just wanted to start off with expenses hoping to get a little more clarity in terms of maybe amount of expenses because it looks like this quarter was certainly higher than expected even backing out the severance and the bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 charitable contribution and i know your guidance is that its going to be above on the efficiency ratio but can you just probably little more guidance in terms of like what dollar amount is the right number to be thinking about here steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think when you look at and the kind of revenue that we think well create in the fee businesses i think thats one of the reasons i feel like the efficiency ratio is going to be a little higher than is because our fee business revenue growth is going to be more than our net interest income growth and when you have fee revenue growth it comes with a little bit higher expense base commissions and other activities there that just drive a little bit higher efficiency business in terms of the percentage and so i think a level you want me to point to an exact dollar level i think its out in the its going to be closer to where we are here at this million somewhere plus or minus in that area i think going forward for is probably a pretty good expense level to use steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah ken and this is steve bradshaw one thing thats always a bit of an anomaly in fourth quarter is that that we have a number of people not only just in the fee businesses but also in a lot of our lending areas that have annual incentive targets and it becomes while we accrue for those throughout the year as we track it it becomes more certain when you get in the fourth quarter so we always see a little bit of lumpiness on the incentive comp side as were accruing for the yearend bonuses so i dont disagree with the way steven characterized that but i do think  always has a little bit of incremental incentive comp cost in it ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got understood and then two really quick questions for you the first question is when you see your capital ratios youre willing to improve i guess whose perspective is that i mean do they go up or they go down over the course of the year steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think what were trying to do is just improve those ratios just modestly okay ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc meaning theyll go higher steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp they go higher ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp so how the percentages go just a little bit were not talking about a lot of capital accumulation here i think well continue as i mentioned to pay a good strong competitive dividend well take advantage of the market where we can opportunistically and stock buybacks but i would like to see the ratio go up just slightly over points ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay perfect and then and just the last quick question how many energy credits i mean what percentage of your energy portfolio are you not the lead on in the particularly in the sncs steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp its about of the portfolio on the snc portfolio that we are not the agent on ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and sncs as a percentage of total steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp as a percent of total energy ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes yeah steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp its going to be a relatively high percentage a steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah half ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect okay thank you very much operator our next questions come from the line of brady gailey of kbw please proceed with your question bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning brady stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc when you look at the guidance for you say stable nim from current level im assuming that means a stable nim from the fourth quarter level of million is that the way to read that steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats correct thats what we think brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then how i mean when you look at accretable yield levels the million in the fourth quarter was the lowest level you had in all of i know that is a shrinking bucket but how do you think yield accretion will trend in steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think that million was a little bit lower than i honestly expected and i really think will fall somewhere in the kind of million to million range of accretable yield i dont know how its going to fall by quarter but i think thats the level that you should probably expect brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally just on deposit costs i know when we spoke days ago you guys were saying deposit costs could be flat to if not up a little bit you saw deposit costs down in the fourth quarter maybe talk about the option of continuing to reduce deposit costs from here or do you think theyve kind of bottomed at this level stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 this is stacy i mean i think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter where we increased deposits about billion but yet reduced overall deposit costs as you mentioned i think that was a huge win for us in terms of continuing to move deposit costs down as we looked forward i still think youre going to find opportunity to continue to lower deposit costs if libor moved immediately as the fed moved deposit costs lagged they lagged going up theyre going to lag going down that gives us some opportunity as we move into to continue to improve our deposit costs as part of our funding and hopefully that translate into improvement in the nim as we move into as well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys operator our next questions come from the line of michael rose with raymond james please proceed with your questions michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys just wanted to touch on the loan growth outlook looks like to full year average to full year average i guess im trying to reconcile that with the difference between the period end balance and the average balance for the quarter looks like there might have been some paydowns or some chargeoffs obviously at the end of the year and trying to reconcile that with some of the comments around some softness around the middle market and energy not growing as much as we move forward so if you can just help me square that id appreciate it thanks stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp absolutely well we had really pretty good loan growth throughout the quarter it was really in the last couple of weeks of the quarter that we saw paydowns in both energy and commercial real estate weve seen a nice rebound in outstanding balances early in january so were hopeful that some of those paydowns that you saw are revolving in nature and will come back if you look at where we grew last year energy grew at were clearly not forecasting energy to grow at that level as we move forward we dont think youll have you will have some lumpiness as weve had in previous periods around quarteroverquarter growth but as you look at longterm growth being in that to range is something that we feel very good about we dont think that the fourth quarter was a trend in any respect as we looked at the nature of some of those declines there was seasonality in some of the businesses that we have on the ci side they tend to fund up in the middle of the year and then pay down at the end of the year energy had paydowns we had paydowns in commercial real estate we dont think thats really representative of what were going to see as we move forward and certainly that has held to be true here very early admittedly in this new year so i feel very good about the guidance that weve provided in that to range and certainly dont see anything today that would make me think that thats not achievable bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for the color and then maybe just switching gears to energy maybe for marc where can you just give some greater color on maybe what caused some of these issues for these two energy sncs i assume it probably has to do with the companys run out of cash if you can just give some color there and whether they were gasrelated or oilrelated and then has anything changed as it relates to your thoughts around energy lending as we move forward as an asset class thanks marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well first on the taking energy as a class whats nothings really changed on how were approaching it what were seeing in the market is really there is an impact from the capital markets and the ad market being a bit closed in certain circumstances and natural gas prices and ngl prices are lower right now so that is causing some issues for certain credits but again were continuing to be ep first lien secured deals from a gas price perspective of our customers have some form of hedging like we dont really look at it on a portfolio basis but we are pleased that weve seen our customer base pursue hedging as a way of protecting their downside risk as it relates to specific credits we kind of monitor those on an individual basis and dont really get too detailed about whats going on on particular deals and will i can tell you that we feel very strongly that our workout team is in certain circumstances is taking all steps necessary to minimize whatever exposure we have and minimize the amount of loss such that we really feel like going forward in we will continue to have our 12month loss in the base to basis points which is consistent with what weve had in the past maybe a little lumpy in the first quarter but going forward we dont see it getting out of whack with what weve had historically michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for taking my questions operator our next questions come from the line of peter winter of wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning peter stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp good morning bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc can you talk about some of the drivers to the to average loan growth because especially with energy which was the main driver for is going to slow and just general middle market a little bit of caution there stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp this is stacy peter certainly energy will continue to be a driver for us i certainly dont want to indicate that its going to not grow next year we think theres going to be opportunity there we grew i dont think well grow but i think we can grow mid to highsingle digits inside of energy which is obviously a large portfolio for us we have ample room under our commercial real estate limits to continue to grow there our teams there are continuing to see opportunities that we think are positive and reasonable from a credit risk to take at this point in the cycle so we think well see growth there healthcare has been an area that we continue to grow and invest in and you see that good growth for the year in healthcare we have high expectations for that team in and we think well continue to grow there where some of the softness is is maybe on the lower end of ci where you may have a sole proprietor or a single business owner who is kind of a little bit more cautious about the macro environment but we think that clearly if you think about what weve done on the wealth side we grew our lending side in the wealth space strong double digits last year and we think that will be a growth driver for us in as well so as you kind of add the pieces together and roll that forward into we certainly feel very confident that something in the to range is very achievable for us peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and on the fee income side you talked about brokerage and trading and wealth im just wondering can you talk a little bit steven about the outlook for mortgage banking in steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so i think we have good origination capability across our footprint we feel very confident with the purchase market there and our ability to serve that market and so i do think itll be a little lower in total for the year of but i think weve got a great approach and a good process and were pricing pretty well weve got good discipline there and so i feel confident that we can achieve some pretty good results in mortgage it may not be at the same revenue level that we achieved in given the different rate environment but i do feel pretty good about the continued growth in that sector peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then just my last question i know you guys have done a lot of work on reducing expenses at the bank im just wondering with a tougher revenue environment are there still opportunities to cut expenses at the bank bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah peter this is steve we actually really worked in earnest on that initiative really going back into the fall when it became apparent that we were going to see further rate cuts and have more pressure on the net interest revenue side in you saw us take a little over million in severance cost in the fourth quarter and that was really just identifying where we thought we had some opportunities across the board were also curtailing some of the expansion of new positions across the bank as well theres always opportunities and were always seeking an opportunity to improve efficiency were being careful not to do that on the backs of reducing our investment commitment from a technology perspective thats important to us competitively and we continue to make strides there but no question well have a hyperfocus on expenses really throughout peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp okay steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you peter operator our next questions come from the line of gary tenner of da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co hey so two questions one on the deposit side you gave obviously steven the sequential quarter change in deposit costs could you give us any interquarter color in terms of deposit cost maybe where they were in december bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no i mean i dont have that in front of me exactly what they are in december i just know the composite deposit cost for the quarter as stacy mentioned earlier we were happy to see that go down from to as he mentioned i think there is opportunity there to continue to drive that down a bit but beyond that i probably wouldnt comment further gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and then broader perspective on the oklahoma economy were hearing that maybe theres a bit of a slowdown there lower tax receipts theres been some job cuts i think at some of the larger energy companies in the state can you talk about kind of the perspective for the broader oklahoma economy steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp oklahoma is doing well i think the decline in tax receipts is largely driven by declines in gross production taxes as theres been less drilling in the scoop and the stack here in oklahoma but kind of corporate taxes and personal income taxes have held in very well and are actually slightly up a little bit so i think the oklahoma economy is doing well we dont see any weakness really the job cuts seem to be being able to be absorbed by the economy in a reasonable period of time so were not seeing kind of inherent weakness there understanding that there is some dislocation from time to time with certain companies but theres job growth here too thats able to absorb that and state is doing well gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next questions come from the line of matt olney of stephens inc please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning guys stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp morning matt steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 hey matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc i want to go back to i think it was peters first question on loan growth drivers in and stacy it sounds like energy will be a decent part of the driver and i think energy is now around of loans outstanding can you just remind us what your internal limits are on this asset class and with the higher chargeoffs that we saw this quarter from energy is there any pause or concern about growing this book in the future thanks stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp sure we have ample room inside of our concentration limits we dont see anything that would be a constraint on our ability to grow it other than the opportunity to find good deals and if you look at actual net chargeoffs weve been in this million to million per quarter now for a while i dont see the fourth quarter as an anomaly from that perspective i think its very consistent and actually if you go back and look at the fourth quarter last year i think net chargeoffs fourth quarteroverfourth quarter almost identical so were as marc alluded to were kind of providing some guidance that we think net chargeoffs will be in that to basis point range next year for the full calendar year there could be some of that thats front loaded earlier in the year as some of these nearterm issues work themselves through the process but we still feel very good about this space you talk about net chargeoffs in energy this year they were higher than last year they were at about basis points or so in the ep space but if you think about the sector overall were getting to basis points additional spread on those loans we think well continue to see some opportunity to improve that in as others think about their exposure here but we like this business through the cycle we understand that this has been a longer term ebb and flow in this industry than weve seen in a while but we have a great team the credit teams and the line are working great together we have a great engineering staff we think that were wellpositioned to be able to manage through this and do it in a way that is good for the shareholders and good for us i think weve talked about there will be some lumpiness in criticized and classified and nonaccruals and you see that a little bit but even with all that our nonaccrual loans are less at the end of the fourth quarter than they were at the end of the second quarter so theres a little bit where were going to go up theres a little bit where were going to go down but it will ebb and flow and its at a level that we believe is very manageable and for the full year were going to have basis points in net chargeoffs for the company we think thats going to compare very favorably to our peer group and so its an asset class that clearly is in the media a lot there is issues with around liquidity in the space to a large extent but were working through that and i think were very wellpositioned to manage that were still as energized if you will around energy as we ever have been because we think that its an important part of our dna as a company and we continue to want to emphasize that as a core product offering for bok financial matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that color stacy and then sticking on the credit discussion the press release mentioned that nonaccrual loans did tick up and i think it was pointing to a million increase from that multifamily community development credit can you tell us more about this credit and is that part of the senior housing portfolio bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp it is not a part of the senior housing portfolio this is a very low income housing tax credit deal that we made as part of our investment in the communities that we serve it has demonstrated some weakness since it has been slower to lease up but leasing is commencing its just moving at a slower pace we dont foresee any real significant loss i wont say zero loss but certainly not any thats significant related to that new nonaccrual loan in the fourth quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay guys thank you steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next set of questions come from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning all steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc few followups steven maybe for you early on when you talked about the nim you said it was the full realization of the last two cuts we talked a little bit about deposit pricing but im just curious are you saying that you feel like the earning asset yield pressure that we saw last quarter has essentially run its course is that the message that youre sending steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think a good portion of it is yeah when you think about the number of the percentage of liborbased loans that we have theyve repriced effectively and so i think the majority of that is in the numbers jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 okay good and then stacy or steve maybe for you this general slowdown in ci that you talked about and i think you used the term pause and maybe its a confidence issue obviously three months ago it was maybe a little bit more pessimistic and things are a little more optimistic today have you seen any of that pause or confidence improve a bit in the last three months or is it just more of the same stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp i think the environment on the middle market and lowerend middle market ci side has been relatively consistent over the last few months i think as we begin to get more certainty around some of these things i think youll see continued opportunities for people to invest in their business buy a new piece of equipment add a line grow and expand the business but today thats not been an area that weve seen a lot of growth in certainly outpacing gdp growth weve talked for many years about kind of being able to outpace gdp growth you can do it a little bit but not a much and not consistently and if you do then be careful and so i think thats kind of what were seeing is just kind of slow steady growth not highsingle digit kind of growth in that space jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good talked about two large yearend expected paydowns can you give us an idea of the size of those how material they were stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp no we didnt have we had paydowns broadly in both in really three areas in energy and commercial real estate and in our wholesale retail sector just portfolio paydowns they werent large credits some of that cyclicality on one of those in the wholesale retail sector tends to fund up in the summer as they go through the kind of christmas selling season and they buy inventory and they tend to sell down as cash flow comes in during that period of time energy and commercial real estate were just kind of the nature of the business nothing unusual there particularly but as i look at the early part of i see a nice rebound there and so im certainly optimistic as we move into that that was not a trend but just kind of a late fourth quarter anomaly sometimes you see those kinds of things jon i dont know if its balance sheet dressing for some of those companies or not window dressing but well see that and tend not to react to that real strongly based on what we see late in the fourth quarter as we move forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right i may have misheard you on that but that helps and then last one it sounds like you still you have quite a bit of room in commercial real estate but you mentioned concentration limits a couple of times can you just remind us of the themes and kind of the guardrails on that stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 so commercial real estate is based on both of our limits in energy and commercial real estate are based on committed not outstanding there are of tier capital in reserve for commercial real estate i think its of tier capital in reserves for energy that weve got ample room to grow consistent with the guidance that we provided above those faces we dont have any overwriting concerns that our internal concentration guidelines will be a constraint for growth in those areas in a meaningful way in jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you operator our final questions come from the line of jared shaw of wells fargo security please proceed with your questions timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp okay timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc first question i just want to circle back to some of the commentary on energy im wondering if some of the weakness in energy market is manifesting itself in other industries and if so how much of that is driving the commentary around the sluggishness in middle market ci stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp youre talking just a broader spillover effect in the broader kind of colorado texas and oklahoma economy timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc correct stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp its a natural conclusion to see that and wonder about that its not obvious to me at this stage that thats what were seeing if you think about really from my perspective this is the kind of a tail of this original downturn that happened in i think it was more pronounced in that period of time i think where we are today its not nearly as pronounced and its a little bit more steady state from that perspective im not necessarily its a good question but im not necessarily seeing a direct tie at this point to the slowdown in general ci to the weakness to some weakness thats being demonstrated in it could be i think that was more obvious and pronounced several years bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 ago but as weve stabilized in this kind of to price for oil particularly in our footprint markets i think that thats less of an issue timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe switching gears to the deposit growth this quarter pretty impressive was that just the culmination of the work thats been going on that kind of allhit in the fourth quarter and i guess looking at some of the initiatives that have been taking place whats still remaining and how should we think about deposit growth heading into stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp so deposit growth is something that steve laid out for us as an important initiative to kind of try to grow deposits to fund the loan growth in and as you go through that process its a hard its a ship that doesnt turn immediately it takes a lot of time and effort to begin to cultivate and identify the opportunities if you look in the fourth quarter scott grauer in our wealth team really did an exceptional job of bringing in great deposits priced at reasonable levels they were a big driver for the deposit growth in the fourth quarter but the commercial businesses did a great job with that as well really just as a result of the longterm effort kind of the culmination of an effort thats been going on for a while in terms of moving the deposit needle as we think about i think our really desire is kind of growth at a reasonable price we want to grow to continue to fund the loan growth but were very mindful of ensuring that were paying attention to the cost of those deposits and doing everything we can to minimize the impact to our net interest margin as we think about growing deposits in timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last one for me looking at mortgage banking revenue versus expense and the disconnect there this quarter is that a timing issue or was that a trueup on incentive for the strong year and if steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp the biggest driver of the revenue side is commitment levels and then the expense side is really tied more to loan fundings and so if you look at loan fundings theyre pretty level and so the work that had to take place to get loan fundings completed in the mortgage banking cost line item is there but the revenue side is more influenced by the commitment levels at the end of the year which did drop off so thats kind of the disconnect this timing timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session i will now turn the call back over to steven nell for any closing
