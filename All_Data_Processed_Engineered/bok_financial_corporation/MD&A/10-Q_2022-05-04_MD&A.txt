assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the first

benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities was basis points for the first quarter of a decrease of basis point compared to the first quarter of our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately percent of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest

mortgage servicing rights interest rate volatility during the first quarter had a significant negative impact to our mortgagerelated fee businesses reducing the ratio of fees and commissions from our historical range of percent to percent we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading as we experienced in the first quarter of the velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized as interest rates are expected to move higher we expect to experience increased benefits to our net interest margin which provides an offset to reduced mortgagerelated fee income generally for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates we expect growth to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the recent impact of the covid19 pandemic regulatory constraints increased

consumer banking and wealth management commercial banking includes lending treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses middle market and larger commercial customers commercial banking also includes the transfund eft network consumer banking includes retail lending and deposit services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private banking services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds and capital costs credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered the difference between credit costs attributed to the lines of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to funds management in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table net income attributable to

pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs credit risk and profit the customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our
