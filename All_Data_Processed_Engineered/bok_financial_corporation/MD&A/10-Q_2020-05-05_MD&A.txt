are not limited to oil and gas entertainment and leisure and senior housing energy loan balances comprise percent of total loans senior housing comprises percent and entertainment and leisure comprises approximately percent while our liquidity remains strong given the extraordinary impact of the pandemic on the capital markets weve taken a number of precautionary measures to ensure it remains so including enhanced daily monitoring of liquidity by tracking deposit inflows and outflows by customer analyzing loan advances by segment optimizing our borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank and increasing our collateral at the federal reserve discount window among other things financial highlights net interest revenue totaled million a decrease of million compared to the first quarter of net interest margin was percent for the first quarter of compared to percent for the first quarter of the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate a total of basis points

the covid19 pandemic average earning assets were billion for the first quarter of compared to billion for the first quarter of net interest revenue decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of while net interest margin decreased basis points fees and commissions revenue totaled million an increase of million over the first quarter of brokerage and trading revenue increased million and mortgage banking revenue increased million as lower mortgage interest rates have increased mortgage production and related trading activity fees and commissions revenue increased million over the fourth quarter of largely due to increases in brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenue other operating expense totaled million a million decrease compared to the first quarter of personnel expense decreased million largely due to a decrease in deferred compensation costs nonpersonnel expense increased million over the first quarter of primarily due to increases in data processing and communications expense and professional fees and services operating expense decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of personnel expense decreased million with a decrease in deferred compensation and incentive compensation partially offset by a seasonal increase in employee benefits nonpersonnel expense decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of led by decreases in mortgage banking and business promotion expenses the allowance for loan losses totaled million or percent of outstanding loans and percent of nonaccruing loans at march excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by us government agencies the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was million or percent of outstanding

december interestbearing transaction deposits increased billion while demand deposit balances increased million average deposits increased billion including a billion increase in interestbearing deposits partially offset by a million decrease in demand deposits strong deposit growth was driven by a combination of our continued focus on growing core customer deposits inflows from external money funds and seasonal inflows the common equity tier capital ratio at march was percent other regulatory capital ratios were tier capital ratio percent total capital ratio percent and leverage ratio percent we have elected to implement relief afforded by the cares act which allows us to defer a portion of the impact to regulatory capital impact resulting from our adoption of cecl over the next two years followed by a phase out of that deferral over the following three years at december the common equity tier capital ratio was percent the tier capital ratio was percent total capital ratio was percent and leverage ratio was percent the company repurchased  at an average price of per share in the first quarter of and  at an average price of in the fourth quarter of we view share buybacks opportunistically but within the context of maintaining our strong capital position the company paid a regular cash dividend of million or per common share during the first quarter of on april the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per common share payable on or about may to shareholders of record as of may critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates the following discussion represents significant changes to critical accounting policies and estimates during in the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company significant changes to critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from loan commitments the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters resulting in a subjective calculation which contains a certain amount of imprecision because of the subjective forwardlooking nature of the calculation changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events in future periods management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods as of january bok financials accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic assets measured at amortized cost asu or cecl prior years are not restated prior to january general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses see note to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments for the majority of riskgraded loans the accruing loans expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario and judgmental allocations for risks otherwise not captured in the calculation probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses probability of default is based on risk grades a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan this subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss other subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios both of which are overseen by a senior management committee with members independent of the allowance process determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters which may be reflected as industry or product judgmental allocations or nonspecific allowances this results in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents managements best estimates at the time actual credit losses will differ from managements estimate portfolio composition will change over time actual economic conditions will differ from probabilityweighted assumptions borrowerspecific circumstances will change as well as other factors differences between actual losses and managements estimates may materially affect the companys results of operations results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of net purchase accounting discount accretion was million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of table shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities net interest margin was percent for the first quarter of compared to percent for the first quarter of the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was percent a decrease of basis points compared to the first quarter of the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate a total of basis points since the middle of three basis point cuts were made in the second half of and an additional basis points in emergency cuts were made in march in response to the economic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic the latest reductions reduced the federal funds rate to nearly zero the impact from these latest cuts will more fully be felt in the second quarter loan yields decreased basis points to percent primarily as a result of the decrease in shortterm interest rates the yield on trading securities decreased basis points to percent the yield on interestbearing cash and cash equivalents decreased basis points to percent the available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased basis points to percent and the yield on fair value option securities decreased basis points to percent funding costs decreased basis points compared to the first quarter of the cost of other borrowed funds decreased basis points and the cost of interest bearing deposits decreased basis points the benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities was basis points for the first quarter of a decrease of basis points compared to the first quarter of average earning assets for the first quarter of increased billion or percent over the first quarter of the average balance of available for sale securities which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by us government agencies increased billion we purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk we have increased the size of our bond portfolio in order to reduce our exposure to falling shortterm interest rates fair value option securities which we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights increased billion average loans net of allowance for loan losses increased million interestbearing cash and cash equivalent balances increased million trading securities balances decreased million receivables from unsettled securities sales primarily related to our us agency residential mortgagebacked trading operations increased billion growth in average earning assets and noninterest bearing receivables was primarily funded by an increase in average deposits and other borrowed funds average deposits increased billion compared to the first quarter of as we have focused on acquiring and growing deposits to enhance liquidity and support balance sheet growth interestbearing deposits increased billion while demand deposit balances decreased million average borrowed funds increased billion over the first quarter of primarily from federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements taxequivalent net interest revenue decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of the first quarter of included million of purchase accounting discount accretion while the fourth quarter of included million average earning assets increased million compared to the fourth quarter of average available for sale securities increased million as we repositioned the balance sheet for the current rate environment fair value option securities balances increased million interestbearing cash and cash equivalents increased million average loan balances decreased million in addition receivables from unsettled securities sales that support our mortgage trading activities increased billion growth in average earning assets and noninterest bearing receivables was largely funded by a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits net interest margin was percent compared to percent in the previous quarter while the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate in multiple rates cuts in the latter half of and first quarter of libor has remained elevated relative to the rate cuts this combined with our ability to move deposits costs down preserved a large portion of our margin the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points and the yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points the yield on the available for sale securities portfolio decreased basis points and the yield on interestbearing cash and cash equivalents was down basis points funding costs decreased basis points the cost of interestbearing deposits decreased basis points and the cost of other borrowed funds decreased basis points the benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to basis points which is the primary component of the basis point decline in net interest margin from the prior quarter our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixedrate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the market

first quarter of excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as falling interest rates resulting in compression in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also increase mortgage related trading activities and mortgage production volumes we expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the recent impact of the covid19 pandemic regulatory constraints increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases brokerage and trading revenue brokerage and trading revenue which includes revenues from trading customer hedging retail brokerage and investment banking increased

economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities trading revenue was million for the first quarter of a million or percent increase compared to the first quarter of lower mortgage interest rates increased customer mortgagebacked trading activities in addition trading revenue growth reflects a shift in the mix of our tobeannounced residential mortgagebacked securities contracts

rates than nonfiduciary andor managed relationships fiduciary and asset management revenue increased million or percent compared to the first quarter of fiduciary and asset management revenue was relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of the decline in the fair value of assets was primarily related to the final month in the quarter as a result revenues remained strong relative to the

services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private banking services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business the operations of cobiz were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of prior to april cobiz operations were included in funds management and other we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds actual net credit losses and capital costs in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm libor rate and a moving average of an intermediateterm swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the shortterm libor rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediateterm swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain rate sensitive deposits to five years economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table net income attributable to our lines of business decreased million compared to the first

prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans a primary risk of holding residential mortgagebacked securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during

various risks including fluctuations in energy cattle and other agricultural product prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates each of these programs work essentially the same way derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the company offsetting contracts are executed between the company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates the counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs credit risk and profit the customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our customers and from the counterparties customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures the effects of changes in commodity prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer customers may also be required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit

each of the counterparties individual limits are established by management approved by credit administration and reviewed by the assetliability committee margin collateral is required if the exposure between the company and any counterparty exceeds established limits based on declines in the counterparties credit ratings these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required a deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in bok financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts

established limits also changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets these risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs based on current prices a decrease in market prices equivalent to per barrel of oil would not be great enough to create a scenario in which we are owed by our customers this is due to the price of oil being within the weighted average fixed price of the portfolio rather we would be owed by the counterparties however due to our margining status with counterparties one would not see any impact here an increase in prices equivalent to per barrel of oil would not yet create a scenario in which we are owed by customers as the price of oil would still be within the weighted average fixed price of the portfolio further increases in price to the equivalent of per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of our derivative assets by million with lending customers comprising the bulk of the assets liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating at march a decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately million the fair value of our tobeannounced residential mortgagebacked securities and interest rate swap
