the available for sale securities portfolio at lower current market rates net interest revenue was consistent with the second quarter of net interest margin increased basis points fees and commissions revenue totaled million a decrease of million compared to the third quarter of mortgage banking revenue decreased million due to a combination of lower mortgage production volume and margin compression brokerage and trading revenue decreased million largely due to a shift from trading revenue to net interest revenue on trading securities these decreases were partially offset by growth in

banking revenue also increased million other operating expense totaled million a decrease of million compared to the third quarter of personnel expense decreased million due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense nonpersonnel expense decreased million compared to the third quarter of as lower mortgage banking costs and fdic insurance expense were largely offset by increased data processing and communications expense and operating expenses on repossessed oil and gas properties operating expense was consistent with the second quarter of as a million increase in personnel

per common share payable on or about november to shareholders of record as of november results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the third quarter of and million for the third quarter of net interest revenue increased million from growth in average earning assets and million from changes in interest rates table shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities net interest margin was percent for the third quarter of compared to percent for the third quarter of the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was percent a decrease of basis points the available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased basis points to percent as principal cash flows received from maturities of the available for sale securities portfolio continue to be reinvested at lower current market rates loan yields increased basis points to percent largely due to increased nonuse fees related to lower credit line utilization as discussed in the managements discussion and analysis loan

securities increased billion the average balance of available for sale securities which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by us government agencies increased million we purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk average loans net of allowance for loan losses decreased billion largely due to purposeful deleveraging by our customers as borrowers continue to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty combined with the reduction in ppp loans fair value option securities that we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased million average deposits increased billion compared to the third quarter of deposit growth is largely due to customers

to net interest margin from assets funded by noninterest liabilities was basis points for the third quarter of an increase of basis point compared to the prior quarter our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity

revenue diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented percent of total revenue for the third quarter of excluding provision for

offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading we expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the

revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets rates applied to asset values vary based on the nature of the relationship fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than nonfiduciary andor managed relationships fiduciary and asset management revenue increased million or percent compared to the third quarter of an increase in trust and managed account fees from higher client asset balances was partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund fees as the low rate environment has put pressure on our mutual fund revenue streams we had

money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the current shortterm interest rate environment fiduciary and asset management revenue was up slightly compared to the second

risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds actual net credit losses and capital costs in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is updated annually at the beginning of the year and transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is updated annually at the beginning of the year and is based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm libor rate and a moving average of an intermediateterm swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the shortterm libor rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediateterm swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have

profit the customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our customers and from the counterparties customer credit risk is monitored through existing
