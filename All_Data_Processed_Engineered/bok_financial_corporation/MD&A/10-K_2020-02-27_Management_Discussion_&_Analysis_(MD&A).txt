quarter of table end critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates the following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk is assessed quarterly by management based on an ongoing evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio and probable estimated losses on unused commitments to provide financing a consistent welldocumented methodology has been developed and is applied by an independent credit administration department to ensure consistency across the company the allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to certain impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover general allowances for unimpaired loans that are based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class there were no material changes in the approach or techniques utilized in developing the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk during loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements including loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring internally risk graded loans are evaluated individually for impairment substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and personal loans are risk graded through a quarterly evaluation of the borrowers ability to repay specific allowances for impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover are measured by an evaluation of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loans initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for certain collateral dependent loans collateral value of real property is generally based on third party appraisals that conform to uniform standards of professional appraisal practice less estimated selling costs appraised values are on an asis basis and generally are not adjusted by the company updated appraisals are obtained at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values may have declined collateral value of mineral rights is determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows under current market conditions the value of other collateral is generally determined by our special assets staff based on liquidation cash flows under current market conditions collateral values and available cash resources that support impaired loans are evaluated quarterly historical statistics may be used as a practical way to estimate impairment in limited situations such as when a collateral dependent loan is identified as impaired near the end of a reporting period until an updated appraisal of collateral value is received or a full assessment of future cash flows is completed estimates of future cash flows and collateral values require significant judgments and may be volatile general allowances for unimpaired loans are based on estimated loss rates by loan class the appropriate historical gross loss rate for each loan class is determined by the greater of the current loss rate based on the most recent twelve months or average gross loss rate over the longterm credit cycle recoveries are not directly considered in the estimation of historical loss rates recoveries generally do not follow predictable patterns and are not received until wellafter the chargeoff date as a result of protracted legal proceedings for risk graded loans historical loss rates are adjusted for changes in risk rating for each loan class the weighted average current risk grade is compared to the weighted average longterm risk grade this comparison determines whether the risk in each loan class is increasing or decreasing historical loss rates are adjusted upward or downward in proportion to changes in weighted average risk grading general allowances for unimpaired loans also consider inherent risks identified for a given loan class inherent risks include consideration of the loss rates that most appropriately represent the current credit cycle and other factors attributable to a specific loan class which have not yet been represented in the historical gross loss rates or risk grading examples of these factors include changes in commodity prices or engineering imprecision which may affect the value of reserves that secure our energy loan portfolio construction risk that may affect commercial real estate loans changes in regulations and public policy that may disproportionately impact health care loans and changes in loan product types nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class these factors include trends in the economy in our primary lending areas concentrations in loans with large balances and other relevant factors fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date an orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale a hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly level and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities level fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a nonrecurring basis fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs level are considered critical accounting policies and estimates additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in notes and of the consolidated financial statements mortgage servicing rights we have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders occasionally mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value we carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds assumed servicing costs earnings on escrow deposits ancillary income and discount rates assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset a separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates housing turnover rates estimated loan curtailment anticipated defaults and other relevant factors the prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio the discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements at least annually we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model the assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful considering all related assumptions we expect a basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by million we expect a million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates valuation of impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets the fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a nonrecurring basis the fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted thirdparty appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on level inputs fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on thirdparty appraisals are considered to be based on level inputs significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets uncorroborated expert opinions or managements knowledge of the collateral or industry the fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production sales prices operating expenses severance ad valorem taxes capital costs and appropriate discount rate fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on level inputs income taxes determination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws rules regulations and interpretations it also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates interpretations and judgments management evaluates the companys current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income tax credits and statutory tax rates annually we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized we also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence it is morelikelythannot that our position would prevail upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation based upon the technical merits of the position unrecognized tax benefits including estimated interest and penalties are part of our current accrued income tax liability estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in facts and circumstances results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled billion for up from million for taxequivalent net interest revenue increase d million over

prior year primarily from increased borrowings from federal funds purchased and the federal home loan banks our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report as shown in table approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rateneutral position we purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the market risk section of this report fourth quarter net interest revenue taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the fourth quarter of a decrease of million compared to the fourth quarter of

commercial banking includes lending treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses middle market and larger commercial customers commercial banking also includes the transfund eft network consumer banking includes retail lending and deposit services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private bank services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business the funds management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled the operations of cobiz acquired on october were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of prior to april cobiz operations were included in funds management and other we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds actual net credit losses and capital costs in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm libor rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term libor rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years during the funds transfer pricing rates for nonmaturity deposits became inverted due to the flattening of the yield curve short term rates continued to increase while long term rates remained relatively flat in order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business effective january we made adjustments that attribute more deposit credit value to the business lines with the offset to funds management and other economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes

exceeds established limits based on declines in the counterparties credit ratings these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required a deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in bok financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the

the fair value of derivative assets by million with dealer counterparties comprising the bulk of the assets an increase in prices equal to the equivalent of per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by million further increases in prices to the equivalent of per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of our derivative assets by million with lending customers
