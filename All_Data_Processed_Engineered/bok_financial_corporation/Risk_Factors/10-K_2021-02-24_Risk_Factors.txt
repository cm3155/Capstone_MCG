item risk factors bok financial corporation and its subsidiaries could be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations as well as on its common stock and other financial instruments risk factors which are significant to the company include but are not limited to general and regulatory risk factors adverse factors could impact bok financials ability to implement its operating strategy although bok financial has developed an operating strategy which it expects to result in continuing improved financial performance bok financial cannot ensure that it will be successful in fulfilling this strategy or that this operating strategy will be successful achieving success is dependent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond bok financials direct control factors that may adversely affect bok financials ability to implement its operating strategy include deterioration of bok financials asset quality deterioration in general economic conditions especially in bok financials core markets inability to control bok financials noninterest expenses inability to increase noninterest income inability to access capital decreases in net interest margins increases in competition a breach in the security of bok financials systems and adverse regulatory developments substantial competition could adversely affect bok financial banking is a competitive business bok financial competes actively for loan deposit and other financial services business in the southwest region of the united states bok financials competitors include a large number of small and large local and national banks savings and loan associations credit unions trust companies brokerdealers and underwriters as well as many financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those of bok financial large national financial institutions have substantial capital technology and marketing resources such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than bok financial does which may adversely affect bok financials ability to compete effectively bok financial has expanded into markets outside of oklahoma where it competes with a large number of financial institutions that have an established customer base and greater market share than bok financial with respect to some of its services bok financial competes with nonbank companies that are not subject to regulation the absence of regulatory requirements may give nonbanks a competitive advantage the increasingly competitive environment is in part a result of changes in regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers our success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of financial technology innovations developments in fintech and cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business investment in new technology to stay competitive could result in significant costs and increased cybersecurity risk our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment which is important to retention and acquisition of customers government regulations and political environment could adversely affect bok financial bok financial and bokf na are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit the type of acquisitions and investments that we may make in addition certain permitted acquisitions and investments are subject to prior review and approval by banking regulators including the federal reserve occ and fdic banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve proposed acquisitions and investments in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other things the effect of the acquisition on competition the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including our record of compliance under the community reinvestment act and our effectiveness in combating money laundering they will also consider our financial condition and our future prospects including projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of our management and our record of compliance with laws and regulations regulatory authorities may change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations including the occ our primary regulator and the cfpb our regulator for certain designated consumer laws and regulations violations of laws and regulations could limit the growth potential of bok financials businesses we have made extensive investments in human and technological resources to address enhanced regulatory expectations including investments in the areas of risk management compliance and capital planning political developments including recent federal executive and legislative changes add additional uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of changes in the regulatory environment for the banking industry and for the broader economy bok financial has a longstanding relationship with the energy industry and the local economies within bokfs geographical footprint have a concentration in energyrelated industries the energy industry is facing increased pressure from investors and the government to mitigate greenhouse emissions which could significantly increase costs hinder financial results and shrink the industry our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect bokfs business financial condition liquidity and results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees customers clients counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants and the effectiveness of actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the spread of the covid19 virus and the resulting stay at home orders travel restrictions and closed schools and work places caused severe disruptions in the us economy which has in turn disrupted the business activities and operations of our customers as well as our business and operations the covid19 outbreak was first reported in wuhan hubei province china in december and has resulted in millions of confirmed cases identified around the world many in the us as a result of the pandemic many businesses were shut down or continue to be shut down supply chains were interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable and many individuals have become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions while multiple vaccines have been developed the timing of administration of the vaccines to the full population number of people who will take the vaccines and the efficacy on new variants of the virus remains unknown specific to our operations we face the following risks the pandemic combined with preexisting factors including but not limited to international trade disputes inflation risks and oil price volatility could further destabilize the financial markets and markets in which the company operates the resulting impacts on consumers including the sudden increase in the unemployment rate could cause changes in consumer and business spending borrowing needs and saving habits which will likely affect the demand for loans and other products or services the company offers as well as the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers governmental mandates forced shutdowns of many of our customers and vendors facilities while some have reopened others may extend for indefinite periods this may cause customers thirdparty service providers and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to the company the covid19 virus may have an adverse effect on customer deposits the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations the demand for our loans or other products and services or on financial markets real estate markets or economic growth which could adversely affect our liquidity financial condition and results of operations the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to to on march and announced a significant quantitative easing program in response to the economic downturn caused by covid19 these reductions especially if prolonged could adversely affect our net interest income and margins the value of mortgage servicing rights and our profitability widespread outbreaks of the covid19 virus in our primary geographies could adversely affect our workforce resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism social distancing measures enacted for working employees such as working from home working in different locations and working different shifts could further disrupt the workforce and normal internal control environment this could lead to the inability to adequately meet customer needs maintain adequate financial controls and cybersecurity controls and meet regulatory deadlines the determination of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current expected credit losses the covid19 pandemic and the unprecedented governmental response could make these subjective judgments even more difficult the economic impact of the pandemic and government responses may have an adverse effect on current and forward prices for oil and natural gas which could result in significant credit losses the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans may also be adversely affected as a result of the preceding and other risks if the covid19 virus continues to spread and the response to contain the pandemic is unsuccessful the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations these adverse impacts could lead to a material impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to our reporting units credit risk factors adverse regional economic developments could negatively affect bok financials business at december loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in texas represented approximately of the total loan portfolio loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in oklahoma represented approximately of our total loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in colorado represented approximately of our total loan portfolio these geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas poor economic conditions in texas oklahoma colorado or other markets in the southwest region may cause bok financial to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in bok financials loan portfolio a regional economic downturn could also adversely affect revenue from brokerage and trading activities mortgage loan originations and other sources of feebased revenue extended oil and gas commodity price downturns could negatively affect bok financial customers at december of bok financials total loan portfolio is comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry the energy industry is historically cyclical and prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices could negatively impact borrowers ability to pay in addition the company does business in several major oil and natural gas producing states including oklahoma texas and colorado the economies of these states could be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices resulting in increased credit migration to classified and nonaccruing categories higher loan loss provisions and risk of credit losses from both energy borrowers and businesses and individuals in those regional economies other adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have a negative effect on bok financial customers and their ability to make payments to bok financial certain industryspecific economic factors also affect bok financial for example bok financials loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans a downturn in the real estate industry in general or in certain segments of the commercial real estate industry in the southwest region could also have an adverse effect on bok financials operations regulatory changes in healthcare may negatively affect our customers legislation affecting reimbursement rates along with the continued transition to managed care in place of fee for service payments could affect their ability to pay adverse global economic factors could have a negative effect on bok financial customers and counterparties economic conditions globally could impact bok financials customers and counterparties with which we do business the ongoing covid19 pandemic has affected economies around the world the united kingdom continues to work through issues regarding brexit trade related issues remain between the united states and china and tension exists amongst the united states and opec plus countries including russia and countries in the middle east over oil production levels we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt and limited exposure to european and chinese financial institutions we have not identified any significant customer exposures to european sovereign debt european financial institutions or chinese financial institutions bok financial its customers and counterparties may also be negatively affected by global events such as natural disasters and other external events beyond our control including public health issues terrorist attacks and acts of war these global events may significantly affect longterm and shortterm interest rates energy prices the value of financial assets and ultimately economic activity in our primary markets the adverse effect of these events on the company may include narrowing of the spread between interest income and interest expense a reduction in fee income an increase in credit losses and a decrease in demand for loans and other products and services liquidity and interest rate risk factors fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect bok financials business bok financials business is highly sensitive to the monetary policies implemented by the federal reserve board including the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements which affect bok financials ability to make loans and the interest rates we may charge changes in prevailing interest rates due to the dependency of the subsidiary banks on interest income changes in depositor behavior open market operations in us government securities a significant increase in market interest rates or the perception that an increase may occur could adversely affect both bok financials ability to originate new loans and bok financials ability to grow conversely a decrease in interest rates could result in acceleration in the payment of loans including loans underlying bok financials holdings of residential mortgagebacked securities and termination of bok financials mortgage servicing rights in addition changes in market interest rates changes in the relationships between shortterm and longterm market interest rates or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices could affect the interest rates charged on interestearning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interestbearing liabilities this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income which would reduce the companys net interest revenue in a rising interest rate environment the composition of the deposit portfolio could shift resulting in a mix that is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than is the current mix an increase in market interest rates also could adversely affect the ability of bok financials floatingrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs which could adversely affect bok financials business in the uk financial conduct authority announced its lack of confidence in libor as a market benchmark rate and that it would no longer persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after us regulatory authorities voiced similar support for phasing out libor the federal reserve bank of new yorks alternative reference rate committee has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as an alternative to libor in november of the ice benchmark administration iba the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor announced its intention to cease usd libor for oneweek and twomonth tenors at the end of but extend the anticipated cessation date for the remaining usd libor tenors to the end of june us regulators released a joint interagency statement about their expectations that banks cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december we have a significant number of loans securities derivative contracts borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor given these uncertainties it is not possible at this time to determine the impact of the transition away from libor on the valuations pricing and operation of our financial instruments however the proposed extension of our primary libor tenors to june of reduces our exposure to the libor transition significantly as a large portion of our legacy financial instruments that matured after will mature before june of in order to be well prepared for the transition the company has established formal governance for the libor transition including a libor transition working group the group whose purpose is to guide the overall transition process for the company the group is an internal crossfunctional team with representatives from all business lines support and control functions and legal counsel its responsibilities include but are not limited to monitoring industry developments tracking direct and indirect exposures developing and implementing remediation plans and communication with internal and external stakeholders key loan provisions have been modified so that new and renewed loans include libor fallback language designed to ensure the smoothest possible transition from libor to the new benchmark when such transition occurs all existing financial contracts with direct exposure to libor have been inventoried and are being tracked indirect exposures in the form of liborrelated systems models and processes have been inventoried evaluated and prioritized and remediation is underway changes in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect mortgage banking operations along with mortgage servicing rights as well as bok financials substantial holdings of residential mortgagebacked securities and brokerage and trading revenue bok financial derives a substantial amount of revenue from mortgage banking activities the production and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans in addition as part of bok financials mortgage banking business bok financial has substantial holdings of mortgage servicing rights revenue generated from the production and sale of mortgage loans is affected by mortgage interest rates and government policies related to economic stimulus and home ownership falling interest rates tend to increase mortgage lending activities and related revenue while rising interest rates have an opposite effect mortgage servicing revenue is a fee earned over the life of the related loan however mortgage servicing rights are assets that are carried at fair value which are very sensitive to numerous factors with the primary factor being changes in market interest rates falling interest rates tend to increase loan prepayments which may lead to a decrease in the value of related servicing rights we attempt to manage this risk by maintaining an active hedging program the primary objective of the companys hedging program is to provide an offset to changes in the fair value of these rights due to hedgeable risks primarily changes in market interest rates due to numerous unhedgeable factors hedging strategies may not offset all changes in the fair value of the asset such unhedgeable factors include but are not limited to changes in customer prepayment or delinquency behavior that is inconsistent with historical actual performance in a similar market environment changes in the longterm or shortterm primarysecondary mortgage spreads and changes in surveydriven assumptions such as the cost of servicing and discount rates we also hold a substantial portfolio of residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government agencies the fair value of residential mortgagebacked securities is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates a significant decrease in interest rates may lead mortgage holders to refinance the mortgages constituting the pool backing the securities subjecting bok financial to a risk of prepayment and decreased return on investment due to subsequent reinvestment at lower interest rates a significant decrease in interest rates may also accelerate premium amortization conversely a significant increase in interest rates may cause mortgage holders to extend the term over which they repay their loans which delays the companys opportunity to reinvest funds at higher rates we mitigate this risk somewhat by investing principally in shorter duration mortgage products which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates in addition the company actively engages in trading activities that provide us government agency residential mortgagebacked securities and related derivative instruments to our customers trading activities generate net interest revenue trading revenue and customer hedging revenue trading revenue and customer hedging revenue varies in response to customer demand the value of trading securities will increase in response to decreases in interest rates or decrease in response to increases in interest rates we mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities through appropriate economic hedging techniques market disruptions could impact bok financials funding sources bok financials subsidiary bank may rely on other financial institutions and the federal home loan bank of topeka as a significant source of funds our ability to fund loans manage our interest rate risk and meet other obligations depends on funds borrowed from these sources the inability to borrow funds at market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations operating risk factors dependence on technology increases cybersecurity data privacy and technology failure risk the company is dependent on its technological ability to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions and store and protect a significant amount of sensitive customer information our customers use of our internetbased services and our customer and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security and reliability have increased over time we face compliance risks and costs relating to the data privacy laws existing in multiple jurisdictions congress and the legislatures of states in which we operate regularly consider legislation that would impose more stringent data privacy requirements resulting in increased compliance costs cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the increased use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and ever changing cyberattack techniques used by organized crime hackers terrorists hostile foreign governments and other external parties to obtain confidential customer information and misappropriate customer funds such parties may seek to gain access to our systems directly or use equipment or security passwords belonging to employees customers third party services providers or other users of our systems accordingly our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions breakdowns and cyber attacks our business financial accounting data processing systems and other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled as a result of a number of factors that may be wholly or partially beyond our control in addition to cyber attacks there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters pandemics events arising from political or social matters including terrorist attacks third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing houses financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations could also be sources of operational or information security risk to the company including breakdowns or failures of their own systems capacity constraints or cyber attacks cybersecurity risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect the company from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data from external and internal intrusions disaster recovery and failures in controls used by our vendors a material breach of customer data security or operational or system failure may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers result in increased expense to contain the event andor require that we provide credit monitoring services for or reimburse affected customers result in regulatory fines penalties or intervention or result in litigation all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches or operational failures there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a high priority for us as an additional layer of protection we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage our cybersecurity insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a breach or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms we depend on third parties for critical components of our infrastructure we outsource a significant portion of our information systems communications data management and transaction processing to third parties these third parties are sources of risk associated with operational errors system interruptions or breaches unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and misuse of intellectual property if the service providers encounter any of these issues we could be exposed to disruption of service reputation damages and litigation risk that could be material to our business risks related to an investment in our stock although publicly traded bok financials common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the nasdaq national market system a relatively small fraction of bok financials outstanding common stock is actively traded the risks of low liquidity include increased volatility of the price of bok financials common stock low liquidity may also limit holders of bok financials common stock in their ability to sell or transfer bok financials shares at the price time and quantity desired bok financials principal shareholder controls a majority of bok financials common stock mr george b kaiser owns approximately of the outstanding shares of bok financials common stock at december mr kaiser is able to elect all of bok financials directors and effectively control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of bok financials common shareholders mr kaisers ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for bok financial or any other change in control could have an adverse effect on the market price for bok financials common stock a substantial majority of bok financials directors are not officers or employees of bok financial or any of its affiliates however because of mr kaisers control over the election of bok financials directors he could change the composition of bok financials board of directors so that it would not have a majority of outside directors possible future sales of shares by bok financials principal shareholder could adversely affect the market price of bok financials common stock mr kaiser has the right to sell shares of bok financials common stock in compliance with the federal securities laws at any time or from time to time the federal securities laws will be the only restrictions on mr kaisers ability to sell because of his current control of bok financial mr kaiser could sell large amounts of his shares of bok financials common stock by causing bok financial to file a registration statement that would allow him to sell shares more easily in addition mr kaiser could sell his shares of bok financials common stock without registration under rule of the securities act although bok financial can make no predictions as to the effect if any that such sales would have on the market price of bok financials common stock sales of substantial amounts of bok financials common stock or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect market prices if mr kaiser sells or transfers his shares of bok financials common stock as a block another person or entity could become bok financials controlling shareholder statutory restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other distributions and debts of bok financials subsidiaries could limit amounts bok financials subsidiaries may pay to bok financial a substantial portion of bok financials cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by bokf na statutory provisions and regulations restrict the amount of dividends bokf na may pay to bok financial without regulatory approval management also developed and the bok financial board of directors approved an internal capital policy that is more restrictive than the regulatory capital standards in the event of liquidation creditors of the subsidiary banks and other nonbank subsidiaries of bok financial are entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary before bok financial as holder of an equity interest in the subsidiaries is entitled to receive any distributions
