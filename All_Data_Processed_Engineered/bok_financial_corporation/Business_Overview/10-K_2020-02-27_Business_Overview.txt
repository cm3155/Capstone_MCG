the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place these regulations and others are designed to promote safety and soundness protect consumers and ensure the stability of the banking system as a whole the purpose of these regulations is not necessarily to protect shareholders and creditors as detailed below these regulations

grammleachbliley act and federal reserve board interpretations activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting merchant banking operating a

associations and leasing personal property on a full payout nonoperating basis a financial holding company is required to notify the federal reserve board within thirty days of engaging in new activities determined to be financial in nature bok financial is engaged in some of these activities and has notified the federal reserve board in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhca each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must be well capitalized and well managed and have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act a financial holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries are considered to be well capitalized if they meet the requirements discussed in the section captioned capital adequacy and prompt corrective action which follows a financial holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries are considered to be well managed if they receive a composite rating and management rating of at least satisfactory in their most recent examinations if a financial holding company fails to meet these requirements the federal reserve board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any new financial activities without prior approval the bhca requires the federal reserve boards prior approval for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than five percent of any class of voting stock of any nonaffiliated bank under the federal bank merger act the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank in reviewing applications seeking

combined organization the applicants performance record under the community reinvestment act and fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities a financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited under the bhca from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in connection with the provision of any credit property or

the customer obtain or provide additional credit property or services from or to the financial holding company or any subsidiary thereof or the customer may not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to insure the soundness of credit extended the company and other nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations for example bok financial securities inc is regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra the federal reserve board and state securities regulators such regulations generally include licensing of certain personnel customer interactions and trading operations volcker and swap rules title vi of the doddfrank act commonly known as the volcker rule prohibits the company from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for our own account and having certain ownership interests in or relationships with private equity or hedge funds the fundamental prohibitions of the volcker rule apply to banking entities of any size including the company and its bank subsidiary trading activity remains largely unaffected by the volcker rule as most of our trading activity is exempted or excluded from the proprietary trading prohibitions title vii of the doddfrank act commonly known as the swap rule subjects nearly all derivative transactions to the regulations of the commodity futures trading commission cftc or sec this includes registration recordkeeping reporting capital margin and business conduct requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants under cftc and sec rules entities transacting in less than billion in notional value of swaps over any month period are exempt from the definition of and registration as a swap dealer the company currently estimates that the nature and volume of its swaps activity will not require it to register as a swap dealer enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act directed the federal reserve board to monitor emerging risks to financial institutions and enacted enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and nonbank covered companies designated as systematically important to the financial stability oversight council often referred to as systemically important financial institutions the doddfrank act mandated that certain regulatory requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions in february the federal reserve board adopted rules to implement certain of these enhanced prudential standards beginning in the rules required publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees and required bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced capital liquidity and overall risk management standards in may the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act regulatory relief act raised the threshold for systemically important financial institutions from billion to billion while providing the federal reserve with authority to establish incremental prudential standards for banks between billion and billion consumer financial protection we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers these laws include the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the truth in savings act the electronic fund transfer act the expedited funds availability act the home mortgage disclosure act the fair housing act the real estate settlement procedures act the fair debt collection practices act the service members civil relief act and these laws respective statelaw counterparts as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices these and other federal laws among other things require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts provide substantive consumer rights prohibit discrimination in credit transactions regulate the use of credit report information provide financial privacy protections prohibit unfair deceptive and abusive practices restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers including actual damages restitution and attorneys fees federal bank regulators state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies including regulatory sanctions customer rescission rights action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also damage our reputation and result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including among other things the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers i lack of financial savvy ii inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or iii reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumers interests the cfpb can issue ceaseanddesist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws the cfpb may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act of cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice under the cra each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by among other things providing credit to low and moderateincome individuals and communities depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the cra and are assigned ratings in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhca or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the bhca each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra furthermore banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction bokf na received a rating of outstanding in its most recent cra examination which is above satisfactory financial privacy the federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and is conveyed to outside parties capital adequacy and prompt corrective action the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic have issued substantially similar riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to united states banking organizations to ensure capital adequacy based upon the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels whether because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components risk weighting and other factors federal reserve board riskbased guidelines define four capital metrics based on three categories of regulatory capital common equity tier capital cet1 includes common shareholders equity less goodwill most intangible assets and other adjustments tier capital consists of cet1 capital plus certain additional capital instruments and related surplus supplementary capital tier consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities limited amounts of subordinated debt other qualifying term debt and allowances for credit losses subject to limitations assets and offbalance sheet exposures are assigned to categories of riskweights based primarily upon relative credit risk riskbased capital ratios are calculated by dividing cet1 tier and total capital by riskweighted assets in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the company is also subject to the leverage ratio the leverage ratio is determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets additional capital rules were effective for banks and bank holding companies including bok financial on january as part of a package of regulatory reforms developed by the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector commonly referred to as the basel iii framework several components which had previously been deferred were finalized in these have either already been implemented or will be effective april we do not expect capital to be materially impacted as a result failure to meet minimum capital requirements would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the fdicia among other things identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions failing to meet minimum capital requirements within such categories fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive covenants on operations management and capital distributions depending upon the category in which an institution is classified the various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by fdicia using the total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized stress testing the regulatory relief act eliminated the requirement for periodic company run capital stress tests known as the doddfrank act stress test for banks with assets less than billion although the mandate has been lifted the company still continues to perform capital stress testing on a regular basis executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder the federal reserve board has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking this guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group based on key principles that i incentives do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to identify and manage risk ii compensation arrangements are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii compensation arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective board oversight deficiencies in compensation practices may affect supervisory ratings and enforcement actions may be taken if incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to safety and soundness deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits held by the subsidiary banks are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif in the fdic released a final rule to implement provisions of the doddfrank act that affect deposit insurance assessments among other things the doddfrank act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio drr from to of estimated insured deposits removed the upper limit of the designated reserve ratio required that the designated reserve ratio reach by september and required that the fdic offset the effect of increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio on depository institutions with total assets of less than billion the doddfrank act provided the fdic flexibility in implementation of the increase in the designated reserve ratio but it ultimately resulted in increased deposit insurance costs to the company the doddfrank act also required that the fdic redefine the assessment base to average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity on september the drr rose above accordingly the surcharge for depository institutions with assets of greater than billion ceased base assessment rates will remain unchanged but are scheduled to decrease when the drr exceeds as of the third quarter of the drr was dividends a key source of liquidity for bok financial is dividends from bokf na which is limited by various banking regulations to net profits as defined for the year plus retained profits for the preceding two years dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements and the companys internal capital policy bokf nas dividend limitations are discussed under the heading liquidity and capital within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations source of strength doctrine according to federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support transactions with affiliates the federal reserve board regulates transactions between the company and its subsidiaries generally the federal reserve act and regulation w as amended by the doddfrank act limit the companys banking subsidiary and its subsidiaries to lending and other covered transactions with affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions a banking subsidiary or its subsidiaries may enter into with an affiliate may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of the banking subsidiary covered transactions with affiliates are also subject to collateral requirements and must be conducted on arms length terms covered transactions include a a loan or extension of credit by the banking subsidiary including derivative contracts b a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary c a purchase of assets by the banking subsidiary unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve d acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan and e the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit by the banking subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate bank secrecy act and usa patriot act the bank secrecy act bsa and the usa patriot act of patriot act impose many requirements on financial institutions in the interest of national security and law enforcement bsa requires banks to maintain records and file suspicious activity reports that are of use to law enforcement and regulators in combating money laundering and other financial crimes the patriot act is intended to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to access the us financial services system and places significantly greater requirements on financial institutions financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiaries must have a designated bsa officer internal controls independent testing and training programs commensurate with their size and risk profile as part of its internal control program a financial institution is expected to have effective customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence requirements for highrisk customers as well as processes to prohibit transactions with entities subject to office of foreign asset control sanctions documentation and recordkeeping requirements as well as system requirements aimed at identifying and reporting suspicious activity reporting must increase with the institutions size and complexity failure to implement or maintain adequate programs and controls to combat terrorist financing and money laundering may have serious legal financial and reputational consequences governmental policies and economic factors the operations of bok financial and its subsidiaries are affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities and in particular the policies of the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has statutory objectives to maximize employment and maintain price stability among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board to implement these objectives are openmarket operations in us government securities changes in the discount rate and federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits the effect of future changes in such policies on the business and earnings of bok financial and its subsidiaries is uncertain in response to the significant recession in business activity which began in the federal reserve took aggressive actions to reduce interest rates and provide liquidity while many of the crisisrelated programs have expired or been closed government legislation and policies continue to be accommodative including increases in government spending reduction of certain taxes the continued use by the federal reserve of a materially expanded balance sheet and promotion of affordable home programs in an effort to boost the economy as a result of risks caused by the trade war between the us and china and a global slowdown the federal reserve decreased its target rate by basis points three times during real gross domestic product is forecasted to remain around percent in the unemployment rate dropped to historic lows of percent in and is anticipated to stay below percent in the inflation rate is expected to remain close to percent we expect energy prices to continue to be volatile due to economic political and environmental factors the current political environment trade tensions and the upcoming election could result in a volatile environment in foreign operations bok financial does not engage in operations in foreign countries nor does it lend to foreign governments
