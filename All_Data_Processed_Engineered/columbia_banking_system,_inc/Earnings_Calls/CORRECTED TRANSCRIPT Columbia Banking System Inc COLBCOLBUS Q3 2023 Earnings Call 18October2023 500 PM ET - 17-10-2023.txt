despite industry headwinds we continue to see stabilizing deposit trends integration activities are winding down as we are now in our eighth month since the merger closed im pleased to report we achieved million in annualized cost savings through quarterend surpassing our originally announced target of million these savings are net of franchise reinvestment which included investments in

financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint and for those on the call who want to follow along i will be referring to certain page numbers from the earnings presentation slide lays out our  performance ratios noting stability in the nim our operating efficiency ratio at and our return on tangible common equity just over these are fivequarter views and recall we closed the combination at the end of february this year slide shows our summary balance sheet noting that our billion of deposit growth exceeded net loan growth resulting in the loan to deposit ratio falling back to we also reduced our shortterm federal home loan banks borrowings this quarter by billion which lowered our onbalance sheet interestbearing cash position to billion on slide we highlight the income statement trends gaap earnings were per share impacted by declining merger expense as we complete the integration along with fair value changes due to higher interest rates on an operating basis we earned per share in  about flat with  as the increase in provision for loan loss was offset by declining noninterest expense as we realized cost synergies operating ppnr was up to million in  turn to slide we break out  gaap earnings to help investors understand the nonoperating and merger related impacts on results first column represents our  gaap fully combined results with net income of million or per diluted share and return on tangible common equity of the second column includes our nonoperating designation for income statement changes again mostly related to fair value swings along with million of merger and exit and disposal costs including noninterest expense which are further detailed out in the appendix these net to a million reduction in  earnings resulting in the third column for operating income and again our operating income for  was million or per diluted share with our return on assets at and return on tangible common equity at we added pages to the appendix with trending on each of these columns the discount accretion will be a steady and reliable source of interest income over time as the majority is driven by rate not credit providing us with a steady build of capital over time and recall the cdi amortization does not impact tangible book value so the per share from merger accounting was the equivalent of per share added to tangible book value in  well continue to highlight and trend here to aid investors in valuing all our earnings streams and our tangible book value excluding aoci increased during the quarter to per share moving to the next slide on section we highlight net interest income and margin our nim was steady from  at resulting in million of net interest income the nim excluding merger accounting was weve reduced excess liquidity and cash late in  which should have a positive effect on our nim in  both measures were at the upper end of our prior guidance driven by the increase in customer deposits this quarter slide breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio noting is fixed is floating and are adjustable columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 slide provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios weve taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate environment you can see here the trending over the past year where our ratesdown risk has been reduced significantly and noted below we calculate our cycletodate funding basis which are calculated on a combined company basis over the periods presented for comparability as of the third quarter our interestbearing deposit portfolio ph has priced in of the fed funds rate increases notable here is the cost of interestbearing deposits which was for  and for the month of september and again the lift this quarter was influenced primarily by the additional broker deposits which were used to pay off maturing federal home loan bank advances for a relatively neutral impact on our funding costs the cost of interestbearing liabilities was for the month of september and at september 30th relatively in line with the for the entire quarter slide breaks out noninterest income items noting we had continued growth in service charges and card based fees due to higher revenue from customerrelated products the change in loans held at fair value at the bottom was a direct result of the increasing longterm yields this quarter next up on slide were happy to report weve exceeded our original cost synergy target of or million as of quarterend weve achieved million in annualized goforward cost synergies as we finalized our integration we expect that will lift to million by yearend again these amounts are net of reinvestments made in various areas normalized in the month of september expense excdi was million which would be million for the quarter in the middle of our prior  guidance range which we reiterate at million million note on the right side of the waterfall from the prior quarter this reduction is driven by lower comp occupancy and contract costs to better help investors given the combination accounting and moving forward on slide we provided an updated outlook for on several key financial statement items our current outlook is consistent with last quarters update with a tighter band around the margin as the third quarters results came in at the upper end of guidance given favorable customer deposit flows moving ahead to the next section on the balance sheet on slide we detailed out the investment portfolio the table takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value noting the difference between current par and amortized cost is the combined net discount which will be accreted to interest income over time the decline in market value this quarter of course resulted from higher market yields across the curve as you can tell im excited about this portfolio as it gives us a significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality and the overall book yield was with an effective duration of as of quarter end slide covers our liquidity including deposit flows during the quarter for comparability we presented the table on the left as we were combined for all periods presented total deposits increased billion or in the third quarter and customer accounts increased million and again we used the brokered along with excess cash to fund a portion of the home loan bank borrowing reduction the upper right table details our offbalance sheet liquidity with billion available as of quarter end and below that we had cash and excess bond collateral not pledged ph for loans to arrive at total available liquidity of billion this represents of uninsured deposits as of quarter end slide provides the loan roll forwards noting we sold million of marked nonrelationship resi loans in  our loan portfolio increased on an annualized basis from the sale of indiscernible columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 turning now to slide we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter and at closing for the afs portfolio the acquired discount was reduced million via accretion to interest income and our earnings release detail we include this million along with million of higher bond interest income from the portfolio restructure we completed postclose to arrive at the million total accretion for loans on the loan side we had million of rate accretion and million for credit the total marks declined million in  through a combination of accretion to interest income and the loan sale and finally in the back on slide we highlight our regulatory capital position noting our riskbased capital ratios increased roughly basis points as expected in  we expect to quickly approach our longterm capital target of on total riskbased capital which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders and with that ill now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron slides through provide select characteristics of our loan portfolio including the composition of our commercial books and an overview of our office loans that highlights this diversified granular portfolio primarily supported by properties located in suburban markets moving on slide displays our reserve coverage by loan category additionally the remaining credit discount on loans provides a further basis points of loss absorbing capacity the million provision expense recorded in the quarter accounts for several factors including shifts in the loan portfolio mix and trends in credit migration the slight uptick in nonperforming loans during the quarter suggests a move toward a more standard credit environment following a phase of exceptionally high quality slide provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends in general our credit performance is and has remained positive excluding the anticipated trend in finpac chargeoffs finpac chargeoffs remained elevated during the third quarter still centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio however the plateau and related earlystage delinquency trends we discussed on last quarters call resulted in a reduction in finpac net charge offs which react on a lag to delinquencies excluding finpac chargeoff activity at the bank remains at a very low level ill now turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank turning to deposits slide highlights the quality of our granular deposit base as ron noted customer deposit balances increased during the quarter despite the continued effects of market liquidity tightening and inflation our teams remain active in their markets and are focused on customer acquisition and retention resulted in net deposit increases throughout many of our business lines strategic expansion also supports our business generation activities we opened our first retail branch in utah during the third quarter supporting our intention to columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 big businesses their owners their employees and any others in the communities we serve throughout our eight state western footprint we also selectively added to our talented associate base including the addition of two key bankers in northern california one in commercial and one in wealth management we continue to capitalize on opportunities our expanded customer base provides and our commitment to our relationshipfocused model im pleased to announce our wealth management team had the best quarter in our companys history we are positioned well throughout our markets to win business and drive balanced growth i will now turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks chris our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide we remain above both well capitalized and our internal threshold targets and as ron discussed we expect capital to continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters providing us with ample flexibility for future shareholder return this concludes our prepared comments the team is now available to answer your questions valerie please open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment for our first question our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co wanted to kind of look at that margin guidance you got for the full year looks like you hit the low end of the for the full year youve got to be it looks like youve got to kind of really tank in the fourth quarter in terms of margin what would i guess if you could kind of frame up the environment of how you hit the low end of the guidance for the full year on margin ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 jeff its ron hey good morning or good afternoon thatll be similar to what we saw last quarter right so it depends on customer deposit flows if were on the upper if were positive on that front well be on the upper end and if were negative on that front wed be on the bottom end feel pretty good about that at the end of the quarter jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so again all right it seems pretty well ill move on on the credit side maybe just on the increase in nonperformers could we kind of breakout what type that was in and perhaps where within the footprint clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc it was really centered in two commercial accounts with the bank both of them had been struggling for quite some time and one of them just decided to cease operations and so that one migrated into nonperforming and the balance of it is really associated with in terms of nonperforming assets is that slight escalation in the 90day plus in residential construction in terms of geography they were located one of them was located in portland kind of the pearl district of portland and another one was located in california jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it and i guess the expectation if we kind of track finpac losses like you said kind of a lagging indicator on and tied to delinquencies is that still the case that weve seen that plateau and if we follow delinquencies that continue to come down on that end clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc it is still the case i mean i will say that things the third quarter has a few holidays in it that impacts collection activity any impact to collection activity really hampers obviously reducing those past dues and we had that in the third quarter had we not had that in the third quarter we would have seen some further improvement but that trend should continue obviously into the fourth quarter fourth quarter is usually another difficult one for collection activity but we make sure that were staffed up to handle it so we feel were continuing to be on track jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay one last one on the expense front i dont know if its possible to launch a expense growth expectation yeah its a big year of cleaning up and you got a little extra on the cost savings on the deal in the fourth quarter but if and maybe not if you cant go into a figure just talk about kind of big picture i think you kind of spoke to clint sort of continuing to optimize is sort of the message but any big picture sort of branch consolidation or larger investments that may come in in clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah were always looking at how can we become more efficient and i do think that theres opportunities for us to do that as weve already started were well into our planning process so thats what i was alluding to there were going to continue to invest especially in our de novo markets and chris and tory have made some strategic hires in existing markets in chris prepared remarks he mentioned california northern california so columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 were going to continue to be opportunistic within legacy markets but also invest in those newer markets in those highgrowth markets but were going to challenge ourselves to do that by finding offsets and efficiencies in other parts of our organization as opposed to just simply letting expenses ramp up in terms of kind of a launchpoint for modeling purposes im going to only defer to ron on that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah and jeff well talk about that with an updated guide in january as we look into jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and just curious on the you said that cost saves are net of investment is there a ballpark number that youd pass along in terms of what you think you invested against the cost saves of million ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jeff this is ron again yeah its actually a specific number million so weve got gross of million then down to million jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay great thank you christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey jeff this is chris and to answer your question you asked about branch consolidations we have five left over from the original ones that we did and when we look at our goforward were very pleased with our footprint we think were in a good spot with those and dont anticipate anything further jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks chris operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of david feaster of raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi david columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i was hoping maybe we could just touch on the funding side and specifically focusing on the core funding side exclusive of the broker deposit increases that we talked about earlier im just curious what youre seeing there as we dig in it sounds like core trends are stabilizing that youre actually having some success attracting new clients which may be difficult for us to see in some regard just given clients utilizing excess liquidity im just curious some of the underlying trends that you see there within your core deposit franchise where youre seeing the most opportunity to drive core deposit growth and attract those new deposit clients and how new core deposit pricing is trending torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc david hi this is tory nixon ill talk a little bit on the commercial side of the house and let chris kind of chime in on the consumer side of the house for commercial banking i mean youre seeing just a few different things one folks are using excess cash to invest in their companies when and where appropriate rather than borrow so the borrowing side is just less robust than it was a year ago folks are also kind of looking for yield where they can with any excess deposit we have done i think a really nice job connecting with our existing customer base and just looking holistically at their relationship and with that in mind kind of focusing on where they may have funds at other places and talking about bringing those funds to umpqua bank and have a lot of success with that that will continue without a doubt weve had a lot of success this quarter with it and weve got i think a really nice pipeline as we kind of move into  so chris christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah pretty much the same piece on that david i would add that on the new side our rates are very competitive in the market but where were really seeing the opportunities to deepen relationships is in talking with the customers taking them through our relationship model asking questions about what else they have out there and we continue to source deposits from other institutions as well the teams have really kind of moved towards theres still some minor integration but not technology types of things and our teams are out jointly calling together in all of our markets and winning new business just with their outwardbound efforts david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc sounds good torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey david tory again i thought id just add one more thing on there one of the things kind of going on in our marketplace is tremendous disruption from other financial institutions and were looking weve got it gives us a lot of opportunity and so were working hard in the markets in our footprint to talk to anybody and everybody do we think thats the bank and having some success with that david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc you bet thats great and maybe stepping back a bit it seems like were going to be in a higherforlonger environment for some time im just curious maybe and look i know its still early but im just curious how you columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 think about maybe the margin trajectory and the business performance more broadly in a higherforlonger environment and how youre looking to manage the balance sheet and the business for that kind of environment ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey david its ron and again ill come back to comments we talked about earlier do we see continued customer deposit growth and i feel really good about where were at in a higherforlonger environment i think maybe in terms of specifically well definitely give you an update on that in january and our view as we look into the year but its going to be the basic blocking and tackling you heard chris and tory talk about continued customer deposit growth well look there on that front david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then last one from me you guys have been accreting capital at a rapid pace youre getting close to your total riskbased target im just curious as you approach those targets how do you think about capital management is there any interest in potentially returning capital maybe early next year or at this point in the cycle would you primarily be focused on capital preservation clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well i think our focus is we always want to be good stewards of capital and we have our longterm targets and weve spoken about those and been very consistent with those even on a standalone premerger basis our thoughts around capital levels were pretty consistent and so essentially at basis points to whatever the criteria is to be considered well capitalized and thats our longterm target you know total riskbased capital has been the constraint you mentioned the absolutely were going to look at all capital deployment opportunities i dont think that as soon as we hit like or something that were going to look at a major shift but if were accreting bps bps of capital a quarter it happens pretty quickly where then suddenly or basis points basis points basis points over that target and still growing capital weve mentioned that with our forecast and expectations and the earnings power of this company that theres not a level of what we think would be prudent organic growth that would absorb all of that capital so by default yes we will be looking at capital return and how we do that as we manage those ratios now i dont think you should expect it next quarter necessarily but i do expect that it will be a nice problem that well have as progresses david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc absolutely thanks for the color everybody thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thanks david columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of timur braziler of wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon for the brokered deposits that were added during the quarter can you just talk through kind of the timing during the quarter they were added their costs and then the expected duration ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is ron good afternoon that was later in the quarter roughly two to four months in tenor thats how we managed all of this from a wholesale standpoint including the home loan bank advances and youre talking probably mid in terms of cost timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess as you look at your borrowing position where is that today relative to where you want it to be and as that continues to mature maybe just give us a schedule of how that matures and if the expectation is to replace that with additional brokered ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah and again the home loan bank advances are also in that two to fourmonth tenor so theyre all repriced in that call it mid5 area as well and that just gives us the most flexibility right and back to your second question were obviously sitting on more borrowings than we would like its in response to of course whats happened with just liquidity drain in the overall system over the past year ideally over time deposit growth continues to exceed loan growth customer deposit growth exceeds customer loan growth and were able to pay those down indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and so the first question it seems like the low end of the margin guide seems fairly conservative and im just wondering as we look at nii is that also kind of for an inflection point next quarter or even though there is some stability in the nim we could see another quarter of nii compression prior to that higherforlonger really kicking in and benefiting the top line in ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean specific to that question in  and the guide if were talking about material move its going to coming down again to customer deposit growth i feel good about youre not going to see a significant you should not see a significant change in the net interest income dollars if we do have continued customer deposit growth in the fourth quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 okay okay and then the finpac earlystage plateauing last quarter chargeoffs still somewhat elevated this quarter so focused on trucking i guess does that is that more of a ph quarter one event where that pretty much subsides going forward or is that going to be more of a tail where this lingers for a couple of additional quarters prior to subsiding clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc its going to be a slow reduction over time over multiple quarters to my best estimation timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just last for me the resi loans that were sold about million what was the discount they were sold at if you can provide that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah the par value was in the million to million range so discount was in ballpark ph million timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it great thank you for the questions ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone how are you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good afternoon doing well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just wanted to follow up just on the loan waterfall chart ron i just want to make sure i understand the million from payoffs or sales the single family ph sale i think is the million thats in there and then the remainder of that is just payoffs correct columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thats correct brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then the million of prepayments i just want to ask kind of like what was the success rate in kind of maybe converting those into new originations this quarter torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah this is tory brody so ill be just real quick on that i think the success rate is very very high thats what we want to do we had growth in the commercial side and our ci teams of about million or million and then growth in the cre teams at about million so a lot of success in the rollover of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then could i ask just a generic question on the loan portfolio what portion of it is shared national credits and then of that what do you lead on torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc so our total commitments in the snc portfolio is around billion our outstandings are roughly billion we lead a couple deals today but most of them are just a participation with ancillary business and it is not a part of the organization that we are growing really at all we have really strict guidelines of what we want to be in and what were going to do and it obviously has got to have significant ancillary business including deposits to even consider brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for that and maybe just on the office portfolio you give great detail there but i was wondering if you happen to have what the alll for the office portfolio was clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah yeah thanks for the question brody we choose not to provide that much detail surrounding acl on that portfolio we feel that theres enough detailed information provided elsewhere for the group to really ascertain the quality of our loan portfolios which is high very good quality brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay cool and then i did want to ask this was more of interest for me just on the multifamily originations this quarter i just noticed that there was like a big difference i think between the debt service coverage ratios that you had originated last quarter i think they were like and this quarter they were and like thats still healthy but it was just a big difference and so i just want to know if there is anything specific that kind of caused that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc nothing specific brody without having that detail in front of me its hard for me to say but what i would intimate from this is that we had extremely strong sponsorship on those deals and they were relationshipbased opportunities so we had the banking relationship and knew the client brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then i just have a couple last quick ones for you just on the nonaccruals that i wanted to understand was any of that included in the delinquencies just because when i looked at the buckets that you disclosed on page i noticed that the dq rates had kind of moved higher for owner occupied and ci and mortgage and then finpac as well i just wanted to make sure was there any kind of overlap between the nonaccrual moves and the dq moves clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc explain dq moves brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc the delinquencies so the mortgage went from to the ci went from to on the total delinquencies owner occupied from to clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah that was primarily centered in a couple of loans brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay were those the ones that you talked about earlier clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc correct brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then this is my last one on the one that you talked about earlier where they just decided or i guess you said they had been struggling for a bit and then they ceased operations what was the collateral that was backing that specific loan and i guess like how does the workout process evolve here from when a business just decides to shut down kind of what are the steps look like columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc that was an owner occupied commercial real estate piece of collateral what we do initially obviously is we downgrade it we then get the property reappraised which did come in and ive said on these calls historically about our lending discipline and our aversion to leverage well it played out in this case because we got the property reappraised we still have equity in the property and we continue to work with the borrower on trying to structure an orderly way out of this we will not take a loss on this piece of property brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thats fantastic to hear i appreciate the detail thank you very much everyone operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks ron im starting on slide the rate disclosures so i think somebody had asked before about higherforlonger you do have i guess a back book narrative so i guess im interested in a little bit more color in a higherforlonger environment your views like in terms of the opportunity to defend margin i guess is the first question the second question is i know you provided the spot deposit rate do you have the september margin thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yes september margin was within a couple of bps of the  margin and just back to the first part of the question again i think it was around the loan replacement maturity schedule higher rate environment for longer et cetera again ph the seasonal downtick and we continue to be successful at growing customer deposit balances that is going to be one of the single biggest drivers in terms of where our indiscernible over time because that can continue to reduce highercost wholesale funding right to help offset christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then whats the approximate difference between rolloff yields and new production yields for loans torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc this is tory i dont know on top of my head i dont know rolloff yields but i can tell you production on the commercial side for the quarter ranged anywhere from at the low end to in the highest weighted average just over christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then last one on the tax rate any help on kind of goforward tax rate columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah the ballpark of still is a go forward rate yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks ron ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you on just the deposit flows during the quarter it seems like deposit growth is back and so ron ill take the over on customer deposit growth but what was the difference between  and  i think some of us were disappointed in the  deposit growth and this is obviously rebounded but whats driving these increases is it rate driven or something else ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i think theres a little bit of both in there as far as the market has calmed down somewhat as far as the rapid increase in rates we didnt see as much of that in the third quarter were farther past our initial conversion and things of that nature where ill just say it again that our teams are out in the markets winning new business using the expanded capabilities that we have and when you put those things together the value proposition really comes to play of weve got great bankers that are externally oriented and theyre doing it in a collaborative manner and that allows us to keep our deposit costs down but were also winning business and when you win operating accounts it helps keep it down as well but some of it is just say its the stability of the rate environment and that it yeah we start seeing increases during the quarter and move past some of the issues that happened in march as well and i wont say business as usual but its a whole lot calmer and tory i dont know if you want to add anything columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no i think thats very well said i think its all those things and its a real outbound focus by all of our teams to connect with our customers and connect with prospects and bring business into the bank and realizing that the most important business we bring in the bank is on the deposit front clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah the other thing ill add to that is there is an element of seasonality and its a little murky more so than what it has been historically in terms of isolating the seasonality but i do believe there was some seasonality and its pretty easy for us to track new relationships that were bringing in in particular on the commercial side but the seasonality aspect i think also played a role and then kind of as a continued headwind is consumers are still pressured and the impact of inflation and im not sure necessarily what this translates to where youre at jon but i filled the car up the other day and it was a gallon so you think about to fill your suv up that takes a bite out of a lot of consumers and so i think were still seeing the impact of inflation on that aspect fortunately we lead a lot with the commercial and the operating account side and were seeing great success in winning new business and bringing in additional aspects of existing relationships on that front jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats very helpful i dont know if this is you clint or tory but can you comment on the overall lending pipeline are they changing at all and whats a comfortable pace of loan growth for the company torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah this is tory the loan pipeline is down just a touch from last quarter but its actually pretty strong still and fairly robust so i feel good about the mix in the pipeline and actually the size of the pipeline throughout the footprint i think clint mentioned earlier our de novo offices of utah colorado and arizona weve got some really nice pipelines there which is great to see and i feel good about that i think were still probably a low to mid single digit in loan growth for the bank pipelines for deposits are nice and the fee income is really strong which is kind of an i think connection to the conversation that chris and i both said about connection with clients and prospects and looking at a bunch of different solutions to solve to help customers thrive clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah the one thing i dont think that the pipeline the absolute level of the pipeline tells the whole story because of were being very disciplined and focused on the types of loans and the types of relationships that were pursuing and so where maybe in outside of a quantitative tightening environment we might have done more in terms of real estate and things like that so the types of jump in here chris or tory if you feel differently but the types of loans that were really interested in the pipeline and the activity that our bankers are servicing is really really solid christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 yeah i mean on the commercial side its the ci pipeline ci growth and its business orientation and it comes with to the point that the relationship comes with deposits and fee income and thats critically important in the way that we will do business jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thank you very much clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of andrew terrell of stephens your line is open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good afternoon andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc ron just a quick one on the cash balances should we expect any more normalization from this call it billion level or is this kind of the right level to think about the cash balance ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc again thatll come down to customer deposit flows as i talked about earlier so ideally youre going to see us continue to more normalize that to a lower level probably somewhere in the mid1 range but not sure if that will occur by  or not but thats ultimately where id expect it to settle andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the deposit flows specifically within the quarter on the noninterest bearing side do you see most of the balance contraction occur earlier in the quarter or was it pretty ratable throughout the quarter and then just to put a fine point on the margin and the customer deposit balance discussion if we see deposit trends from a core perspective look similar to that would put you at the top end of the full year margin guidance correct ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 on the first question yeah that was ratable over the course of the quarter there was no specific shock and i think again back to clint talked about earlier on the consumer side driven by just continued inflation the majority of that decline there in terms of  in the guide youre spot on right so if we do better on that front in  were in the upper end a little less than indiscernible but feel good about where were at ballpark going into it andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the finpac portfolio it looks like the delinquencies in that book moved from i think i recall nearly last quarter down to low this quarter i guess should we expect to see the commensurate kind of move lower in chargeoffs heading into the fourth quarter i guess just like magnitudewise or i guess do you think theyll hang around this kind of chargeoff level for a while clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i think in the fourth quarter i think its going to be pretty stagnant thats what i would say again and fourth quarter is historically the most difficult quarter to collect in that business and that just coupled with the just the overall economic headwinds that truly impact these most susceptible companies i think its going to be pretty stagnant in the fourth quarter but i think the trucking will continue to gradually decline its just going to take a while its going to take a few quarters to get to more normalized level in that space andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah okay got it and then the last question i have is just following up on the snc discussion i think you said youve got a billion outstanding in syndicated loans and i realize some of the rationale there it sounded like was the rationale for participation was deposit driven do you have a similar level or i guess is that billion of sncs fully funded with deposits generated by those relationships or is there a greater deposit sponsorship that comes with it or is it less just any more color there would be helpful torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah no this is tory just by nature of that part of the borrowing apparatus theres less deposits associated with that than there is loan outstandings so its just a byproduct of participating in a large credit but with that in mind i mean what we do have weve had for a longer period of time and we have a very strong connection to management and to the companies and we have in almost all cases ancillary business whether thats some sort of fee income business andor deposits andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking the questions ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 operator thank you operator instructions one moment please our next question comes from the line of matthew clark of piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon all just a couple of questions on credit classified up basis points i think to and it looks like you built reserves ci reserves by about million just want some additional color behind the increase in classified and then not only that but just the increase in ci related reserves clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah hey matt the increase in classifieds was really driven by a migration from special mentioned into the classified loan status and its really centered in the commercial book of business and again these are the two properties that not properties but the two commercial borrowers that i mentioned that just continued to struggle and we had to downgrade them into classified status and thats the bulk of that change and as far as the building of the reserve i mean the you see the finpac continues to have elevated chargeoffs weve got the increase in classified loans and the moodys baseline economic forecast continues to move in the direction that warrants building of the reserve matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay okay yeah i was actually speaking to the million not million million increase in ci okay and then just on the overall reserve i think last quarter there was an expectation that maybe reserve coverage kind of trends lower toward but went the other way this quarter just any updated thoughts and obviously macro assumptions change and the environment changes but any updated thoughts on the overall reserve coverage going forward ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i would just say you just said yourself if the macro environment changes the economic forecast change again a little worse this quarter we had a little bit of migration this quarter and so indiscernible matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay fair enough thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah thanks operator thank you im showing no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to jacque bohlen for any closing remarks jacquelynne bohlen senior vice president investor relations director umpqua bank columbia banking
