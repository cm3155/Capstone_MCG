columbia banking system inc thank you clint we achieved record earnings of million and eps of in reflecting strong loan and deposit production a tempered credit environment and a focus on driving net interest income fourth quarter earnings of million and eps of per diluted share was our best fourth quarter ever and amongst the strongest in our history despite the interest rate environment net interest income was up nearly in the quarter to million reflecting the continued benefit of loan growth and our proactive efforts to mitigate exposure to falling rates operating nim was down basis points from the linked quarter with key drivers being lower loan yields partially offset by lower funding costs total deposits ended the year at nearly billion down approximately million from the prior quarter we did have a planned outflow of public funds of approximately million in the quarter as we have said previously public funds are more often akin to wholesale funding and will be used as an alternative funding source when economically beneficial to do so noninterest income of million was down from the prior quarter largely due to the million gain on sale of owned real estate during the third quarter and was up million compared to the fourth quarter of we have continued to make progress in generating noninterest income especially in loan card and financial services revenues our expense run rate remained stable with fourth quarter noninterest expense of million essentially flat to the third quarter our core noninterest expense ratio was for the quarter as compared to in the prior year quarter for the full year this ratio was as compared to for the prior year the full year expense impact of our digital initiatives was million including million in the fourth quarter columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 overall we have had success on negotiating favorable contract pricing and have been able to capitalize more costs than expected our effective tax rate for the full year was which is within our target range of to inline with our comments in the last earnings call we are expecting the day impact of adopting cecl to be fairly muted additional details will be available when we file our form 10k at this point id like to turn the call over to chris chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you greg and good morning everyone fourth quarters record loan production of million exceeded the previous record set in the third quarter of and propelled us to a new annual record of billion surpassing the record set last year by million for the past three years we are focused on increasing our production capacity these efforts are directly correlated to the record results we announced during the fourth quarter we experienced the expected seasonal reduction in line utilization but our bankers success on the production front offset this decline our loan pipeline remains strong and we are confident that we can maintain this level of production while adhering to our credit discipline our deposit base is very stable with the yearend mix of business and consumer which is consistent with our historical levels our cost of deposits continues to be lower than our peers reflecting an even split between noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits we do expect our typical deposit seasonality in the first quarter as clients draw down cash balances to pay down credit and other expenses term loans comprised of the production whereas lines were of the total the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and in variable the overall portfolio is now fixed floating and variable new loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which is lower than the overall portfolio rate of the portfolio rate declined basis points during the quarter during the quarter commercial and multifamily real estate production was or million of total production and ci was or million of the total commercial and multifamily real estate loan totals were up million during the quarter driven by increases in office warehouse healthcare and multifamily sectors approximately million of the increase was offset by a decrease in commercial real estate construction balances as loans moved to permanent status ci loans were down to million driven by seasonal activity in public administration agriculture and manufacturing sectors during the quarter we completed the consolidation of a branch bringing the total to four branches in our puget sound and oregon markets for the year we believe our retail delivery strategy will continue to be a blend of our physical and digital presence i recently announced executive vice president and director of retail banking and digital integration nicole sherman is responsible for blending both we believe she is uniquely positioned to do this based on her years of banking experience including the roll out of columbias neighborhub branch concept we will continue to actively look at markets across our footprint to assess where we want to better position our branch network columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 digital is one piece of our expansion and we will continue the journey from a community banking perspective we expect improvements in our peertopeer money transfer capabilities online deposit account opening and our small business lending capabilities to go online later this year now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thanks chris in summary credit quality remained very stable in the fourth quarter npastotal assets were essentially unchanged as was past dues and problem loans net chargeoffs for the quarter were minimal at basis point and for the year they were only three basis points our fourth quarter provision for loan and lease losses was million including million for the originated portfolio offset by a release of for the acquired portfolios the provision in the originated portfolio was primarily driven by loan growth of million along with a modest amount of negative migrations which is not unexpected at this time of year due to the seasonal nature of some of our customers for the year the provision for loan and lease losses was million which included million for the originated portfolio in alignment with our record loan production and was offset by a recapture of million in the acquired portfolios again loan production was the primary driver as the originated portfolio grew million for the year offsetting this growth was contraction in the acquired portfolios of million which allowed for the releases as of december our allowance to total loans increased by basis points during the quarter to basis points of total loans but was down basis points yearoveryear as always we like to remind folks that this ratio is impacted by our acquisition and the associated loans that were recorded at fair value embedded in those valuations is approximately million of net discount for which approximately million is associated with the pacific continental portfolio million with the west coast portfolio and million with the intermountain portfolio with that ill turn the call back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks andy before we wrap up i want to take a moment to thank hadley robbins for his service guidance and friendship it has been my personal privilege to work with him and we are a stronger company because of his leadership impact all of us wish hadley and gayle a long and prosperous retirement along with our financial results we announced our regular quarterly dividend of we also declared a special dividend of which constitutes a payout ratio of for the quarter this quarters dividend will be paid on february to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february this concludes our prepared comments chris andy greg and i are happy to answer your questions mike now we will open the call for questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 question and answer section operator at this time we would like to any questions you might have for us today operator instructions your first question comes from indiscernible your line is open q hi good morning guys how are you doing clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good good morning ph luke q just a quick question first on just capital deployment was the switch to the special dividend this quarter against the repurchases in the previous couple of quarters is that more pricedependent than anything else clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yes with the upward movement in our stock price it was a point where we felt like from a capital management perspective reinstituting the special dividend for this quarter made more sense than repurchases q okay thats helpful thanks and then i just kind of wanted to move into i think i have in my notes here that you guys were beginning to offer online account opening in the first half of this year do you mind just giving an update as to how thats tracking and then just to followup on that is just the traction on the commercial online platform gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc on the consumer front the online account opening is projected around the second quarter or first half of this year as far as the commercial transformation that was completed last year i believe septemberish and we moved all of our commercial clients to the new platform and its performing very well q okay thats helpful and then just lastly i think you guys have historically said that given the investment and the digital spend over the past year and the kind of relinquishing of a lot of those projects the increased capacity just and so i just wanted to see if you guys were continuing to kind of to say that you were going to move downstream on ma given the excess capacity for ability to integrate and stuff like that i just wanted to see how ma conversations were going columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah the conversations kind of ebb and flow and anything thats percolating out there we generally have a view into we havent changed our stance or thought process around our ability to move downstream on ma with the conclusion of most of our larger platform replacements and additions so thats still very much our thought process and its just a matter of with ma it takes a a lot of it is just timingdependent but were very active in looking at who would be a good potential partner for us and both from a business mix point of view as well as culturally and we continue to stay very busy just evaluating what the population or the pool of potential merger candidates looks like q okay thats helpful thank you for taking my questions ill step back operator your next question comes from jeff rulis your line is open levi posen q analyst da davidson companies hey this is actually levi posen on for jeff rulis this morning i just wanted to clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning levi levi posen q analyst da davidson companies thank you good morning i just wanted to ask a little bit about expenses and kind of strategy there you mentioned that the digital investment spend came out to be million in i was just curious kind of where were at overall in some of those transitions to the digital platform kind of looking into are we expecting more of that less of the same kind of what does that look like gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i assume youre referring at from an expense perspective i think in we completed roughly projects so i think we always characterize that as being midstream its a threeyear roadmap i think as weve talked about weve always said i think that the majority of the spend would come in and and then its really the operational efficiencies around the edges and just continued development beyond that so i would characterize this as being midstream right now and your knockon question may be how much were we able to capitalize in above and beyond those million that directly hit pl and the answer to that is million has been deferred andor put into depreciation through the end of the year so the total spend in was million levi posen q analyst da davidson companies columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 okay great and then kind of staying to the strategy topic are you guys talking about any priority shifts in strategy just with the change in management team coming around the same time that the rate seemed to quiet down gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no my comment during our prepared remarks about the average tenure of the folks on our executive committee being roughly nine years weve all been very much a part of setting the strategy and the path that weve been on and executing on that and weve always bought into it believe in it so theres no hard right turns in terms of strategic focus well obviously continue to evolve and some of the changes on the or additions to the executive team are an example of that evolution with our digital roadmap and the investments that weve made and the ones that we continue to see on the horizon it was very important for us to have that elevated and that was the reason for bringing eric eid to the executive committee in addition we added a technical focus or a digital focus to our head of retail position and thats once again focused on making sure that we get higher adoption rates and realize a return on those investments and then with what weve done on the client and the employee experience side thats become more important than ever and having somebody thats whos got a creative mind like david moore devine was very important for us to elevate to the executive group as well and so its not a change in that strategic focus but its more just evolving as the industry continues to evolve and our customer base continues to evolve levi posen q analyst da davidson companies okay great thank you thats really helpful and then lastly just wanted to ask a little bit or one question about the margin it seems like there was some active management in the second half of with maybe cost of funds and then also yields on more the security side what does that look like going forward gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well i mean i would just say were really maintaining the course that weve said and kind of articulated during in terms of how were managing our exposure to potential falling rates so i dont think into theres any shift in the thought to your point in terms of the security strategy and kind of the funding associated with that weve been targeting million related to that strategy and yearend we probably that hub expands a little bit so i think so the strategy hasnt changed but i think in youll see us come down closer to that target range of million but otherwise we feel very fortunate that we have the tools in place when we needed them to manage the exposure to falling rates levi posen q analyst da davidson companies okay great thats all i have i appreciate it ill step back now gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc youre welcome columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 operator your next question comes from jon arfstrom your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a few things just bigger picture on loan production you guys had a really good quarter relative to what you would normally see this time of year and im just curious if you could give us an idea of make a point on maybe one or two things that might be different over the last few quarters is it taking more market share is it existing clients with more activity or what would you really point to clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc jon i think thats correct so i think its a combination of many things in some of the comments weve talked throughout the year of adding teams in certain locations those teams came onboard and have produced very well and when you couple that with our experienced bankers that are out in the market making calls theyre driving a higher production from that aspect as well other than that i would tell you that it really falls into maintaining the credit discipline and our pricing discipline so its a balancing act but its really its for talented bankers that we have and the new folks that we brought on that continue that production jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and just remind me you typically see a little bit of strengthening in  and then more in  is that the right way to think about it gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well its largely weatherdependent jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc we can see some strengthening towards the end of  so focal date balances but typically not averages but it really is weatherdependent on the ag sector and when they can get in the field so right now its just hard for us to handicap that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then two followups one on the margin help us understand what youre thinking about in terms of the margin i wouldnt call it a highclass problem but id call it a challenge because you have this big lowcost deposit base but chris you also talked about new coupons coupons on new production coming down a little bit is it fair to think about a little bit more pressure each quarter on the margin here or greg do you feel like youve got enough tools in place where you can manage to do some margin stability gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well again jon we really focus on managing net interest income versus q okay gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc its really managing the margin to be honest but i think youve hit the two primary drivers for us one is the coupon on new production deposit pricing is important and we saw some room to go there as part of the program jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc but i think the other thing thats really out of our control is just the interest rate environment what happens to the shape of the curve over time but we feel that again were very fortunate to have had the protections in place when we needed them jon so i think that will help us on the nii side but were going to stay focused on what we can control which is loan production and our deposit pipeline jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then just one followup on the digital spend i appreciate that the capitalized number the total that you shared with us but is the message you said spending is and is the message that the spend is in the run rate for and we may see some of this come off in or is the message that there might be some incremental spending in relative to gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think were still going to see some spend in with the guidance we provided last quarter was arranged the total investment in the million to million range and my best guess right now is were probably at the lower columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 end of that investment and with some ability to capitalize but probably not at the same level we capitalize in im just throwing out broad concepts here jon but jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think when we at some point in were headed very quickly approaching the point where digital spend is just part of our run rate and where that normalizes its still i think a question because were always going to want to keep pace with the digital offerings that are kind of evolving and theres obviously ebbs and flows in that in the environment so its hard to look out and put an iron curtain number or thought in terms of where we start to normalize and how but weve always invested in the business digital is now part of that investment and we are in i think going to hit that point where its just part of the run rate jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah that makes sense good year for you guys congrats gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator operator instructions your next question comes from ph gordon maguire your line is open q good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning ph gordon q greg i wanted to follow up on an earlier question about the security portfolio it looks like endofperiod balances were up close to million and if i back out the premium amortization the yields were up a good bit but based on your earlier answer it didnt sound like that was part of the security strategy did i get that right columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc it wasnt really i mean i think we had stronger deposit growth when you factor out the public funds which really translated into more of liquidity in the portfolio is the way im thinking about it on a netnet basis q okay and then just thinking about for next quarter i think deposit growth is a little bit seasonally softer would you expect that the size of the securities portfolio to come in from what youre seeing in the endofperiod levels gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yes if deposits remain flat to coming down a little bit i would still expect some of the cash coming off the portfolio just to repay some of the wholesale funding we have out there but obviously were staying focused on maintaining our target on the interest rate strategy is well around million but i think theres probably some room to come down to that but i think it will come down a little ph gordon but not a lot q yeah okay thank you and then just on the expenses it looks like there was an fdic credit this quarter do you have whats remaining to be realized and the timing of when that might come through gregory a sigrist a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc its roughly million left on that credit and well be able to tell us take it when the fdic tells us we can take it its obviously dependent upon their targeted deposit ratio that theyre looking at and if were fortunate it will be in the first half of but its a million level its down to a pretty de minimis level q got it clint you touched on ma earlier i just want to get a sense you talked in the past about northern california just geographywise is there preference between in footprint or northern california or maybe any expansion of geographic focus at this point in time clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc well in footprint is always easier relative to generating costsaves understanding the market dynamics the political environment all of those things that we consider when we look at the various markets but that doesnt mean that we would shy away from northern california or other markets theres weve done it for many years we continually update this but weve done a pretty broad geographic analysis and identified the opportunities that are out there and when you look at california i think its the worlds fifth largest economy some of the most of the northern california market is very similar to the markets that were already operating within but theres the local nuances of local politics and market knowledge and so were just spending a lot of time learning about that market and what columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 weve learned hasnt changed our opinion that we think that there are some opportunities there but its more difficult to go into a new market then do something thats already within our existing footprint q got it then last one andy i was wondering if you could provide some local color on the pause of the boeing max assembly at the renton factory nearby what kind of impacts you might see to local economy and whether you see any kind of growth or credit risk as a result of any exposure andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc sure well so far boeings been pretty proactive in retaining the existing workforce in the renton plant and theyre deploying them up north to everett and then down south here in the tacomafrederickson area as well as trying to get folks to go and relocate to moses lake where they have planes parked that need maintenance and boeing understands that the labor pool that they have is pretty unique and they dont want to lose that because when they want to get back into production they dont want those people to have migrated to other companies other industries or other geographies nevertheless as those employees move to everett frederickson and moses lake it will have an impact on the renton area therell be a domino effect in my opinion on restaurants dry cleaning gas stations those kinds of activities weve estimated that our exposure in and around the renton plant is roughly million so for us its a modest amount and that would include just by simple addresses what the exposure is and thats both consumer commercial and commercial real estate i think that nationally the boeing situation can impact other communities in a sense larger because of what happens to the subcontractors and i referenced the companys spirit that laid off people they make the fuselage for the here locally boeing is trying to retain that employee base and so thats good for us and then with most of the local suppliers theyve also created arrangements by which they will either continue to buy parts even though theyre not building planes or they will provide financial support so were optimistic that boeing is doing all the right things to mitigate any big impacts to our economy but we are monitoring it closely and we have identified the potential risks to columbia q so that million would include any local supplier exposure andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc well the supplier exposure extends beyond just around their written plan and if you look at our total exposure its about million to million q got it thank you columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc so for example we have a customer in eugene that is a big supplier to boeing and eugene is a long way from renton q yes thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to the presenters clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc well
