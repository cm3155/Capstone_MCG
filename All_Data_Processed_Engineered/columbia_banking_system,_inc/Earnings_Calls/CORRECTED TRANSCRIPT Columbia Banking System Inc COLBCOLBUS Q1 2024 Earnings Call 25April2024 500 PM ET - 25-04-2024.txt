reconciliations provided in our earnings materials with that march 1st marked the one year anniversary of the closing of our merger it was a notable milestone for our company for many reasons importantly provided us with a full year of data points for what was working well within the combined organization and allowed us to identify redundancies and inefficiencies that are a natural byproduct of large mergers our oneyear anniversary marks the conclusion of our merger integration phase and enabled us to start our operational effectiveness work armed with the observations and learnings over the first year we made significant progress on identifying opportunities for improving our expense profile during the first quarter we reduced our head count by fte with additional reductions communicated internally of for the month of april the fte reductions combined with other expense savings enacted in the first quarter represent annualized reductions of million these savings are reflected as of quarter end not in the first quarters normalized operating run rate of million the actions taken todate for the second quarter add an additional million of savings annualized to the first quarter number youve heard me say many times over the years that we target a top quartile level of performance across all financial metrics and a lower cost structure moves us toward our goal and away from what has been up to this point average at best the meaningful reductions to our associate base were done in a thoughtful manner eliminated positions and retirements spanned all departments and levels of management including the executive team which is now smaller over the past year our leaders gained an indepth knowledge of their teams processes and other factors allowing them to identify areas for operational improvement as full scale review resulted in consolidated positions simplified reporting and organizational structures and an improved profitability outlook we believe these changes will enable us to operate more efficiently while preserving the premier levels of service we provide to our customers associated cost savings will continue to be realized during the second and third quarters with the full benefit of our actions reflected in the fourth quarter expense run rate we outlined in our march update we expect to incur roughly million in related restructuring expense in the second quarter which will be fully mitigated by the associated expense reductions within the current year columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 our organizational review resulted in a swift elimination of redundancies but our work is not complete our process identified many longer term initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and further drive franchise value as many of you know columbia has always operated in a cost conscious manner and we will continue to seek out additional opportunities to optimize our performance from a revenue expense and profitability standpoint i hope our actions yeartodate demonstrate that we are laser focused on regaining our placement as a top quartile bank as we drive towards longterm consistent and repeatable performance upon completion of this initiative our ability to reinvest in our people our franchise and our suite of products and services will remain intact we believe these investments along with a lower expense base will continue to drive additional longterm shareholder value and now ill turn the call over to ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint we reported first quarter eps of and operating eps of per share and our operating return on average tangible equity was while the operating ppnr was million please refer to nongaap reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to our calculation of operating metrics on the balance sheet we had million of loan growth and million of deposit growth for deposits we had a decline in noninterest bearing demand that occurred in january but were encouraged to see those balances flat for both february and march our net interest margin of was within our estimated range of to and the expected reduction from the prior quarter was driven primarily by the deposit shifts that occurred in  and january our nim increased to in the month of march due to pricing reductions on wholesale and promotional funding our cost of interestbearing deposits was for the quarter within the quarter this cost was for both february and march but ticked down to at the very end of march our projected interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position and we expect our rate stay on deposit betas to approximate those experienced on the way up now provision for credit loss was million for the quarter we updated our commercial cecl model this quarter to better reflect historical and expected future losses in the methodology for our combined company was structured to the historical umpqua portfolio composition the outcome was increased volatility in our provision expense that wasnt characteristic of the granularity and quality of our combined commercial portfolio our recalibrated commercial models which now integrate additional data and operating knowledge have effectively reduced our commercial allowance for credit losses its important to note that the increase in our cre and multifamily acl is a response to the transient market conditions in western downtown cores where we maintain a minimal presence in our portfolio despite these adjustments our overall allowance for credit loss remains robust closing the quarter at of total loans or when including the remaining credit discount total gaap expenses for the quarter were million while operating expenses were million weve reflected the fdic special assessment as non operating item in the press release of note we had a number of oneoff items in the quarter that benefited our expense level absent these i peg our normalized level of operating expense at million as a reminder on the expense front we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the efficiency initiative that clint discussed as nonoperating expense in  columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 now indiscernible to our regulatory capital position our riskbased capital ratios increased as expected in  we expect to build capital above our longterm targets which will provide for enhanced future flexibility ill close with our outlook for on several key financial statement items these are consistent with those included in our early march investor presentation average earning assets are expected to remain in the billion to billion range our nim is expected to remain in the to range which includes stability in deposit balances for discount accretion we continue to expect million to million of securities rate related accretion million to million of loan rate related accretion and million to million of loan credit related accretion we expect full year operating expense including cdi amortization in the million to billion range with the cost savings that clint discussed earlier we expect our  operating expense excluding cdi amortization to be in the million to million range on an annualized basis we expect cdi amortization of million for the year about million in each of the remaining quarters of mergerrelated expense of million to million and our effective income tax rate at with that i will now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron the loan portfolio credit performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our throughthe cycle underwriting process and discipline together with the quality of our borrowers and sponsors the trends were observing in delinquency and nonperforming loans are consistent with the shift towards a more standard credit environment which follows an extended period of outstanding credit quality the million increase in nonperforming assets this quarter primarily attributed to our sba portfolio and a single cirelated property is within expected parameters and reflects the dynamic nature of the credit landscape after accounting for the government guaranteed portion the rise in nonperforming loans remains modest our vigilant and ongoing monitoring of the portfolio is augmented by focused reviews of specific asset classes such as our multifamily and our office portfolios these detailed analyses have consistently shown no systemic issues across different industries sectors or regions we have no delinquent loans in our multifamily portfolio and our office portfolio delinquencies remained extremely low at less than basis points of the total office portfolio neither portfolio has had any charge off activity net charge offs for the consolidated company were basis points annualized for the quarter with basis points attributable to the bank and basis points to finpac we remain very satisfied with the quality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio which is highlighted in greater detail in our investor presentation ill now turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank for obvious reasons deposit remains a key focal area for our teams this quarter we adjusted how we evaluate and approve deposit pricing during the first quarter a comprehensive review of exceptions and other pricing authorities resulted in tighter controls and a renewed discipline around deposit pricing these changes directly contributed to the stability of our interestbearing core deposit rates late into the quarter we also reduced our promotional rates on money market and cd accounts and the cd repricing impact in the first quarter was significantly lower than it was in the fourth quarter beyond our actions related to deposit pricing the teams are also focused on bringing new relationships to the bank our branches are wrapping up a threemonth small columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 business campaign launched in early february which contributed million in deposit generation to our first quarter results and an additional million todate in the second quarter the campaign includes bundled solutions for customers without promotional pricing or special products additionally of the balances are noninterest bearing total cost of funds for these deposits was and in addition we have seen an increase in our commercial card and merchant card activity from the increased referrals these actions all contributed to a significantly slower pace of increase in our cost of interestbearing deposits which was as of march compared to as of december and as of september so the first quarters increase was a less impactful basis points compared to the basis point increase during the fourth quarter while these recent pricing and balance trends are encouraging we expect continued declines in noninterest bearing deposit balances during the second quarter due to seasonal pressures that include customer tax payments noninterest bearing balances were down on an endofperiod basis in the first quarter but they were down on an average basis due to seasonal declines late in the fourth quarter the higher rate environment and inflationary pressures have contributed to noninterest bearing balance migration over the past two years with the fed funds rate seemingly stabilized and given our proactive pricing discussions we expect deposit pricing pressure to remain moderated when compared to but persistent inflation continues to draw down customers account balances which may exacerbate the tough seasonal deposit flows we typically experience in the second quarter that said our teams are focused on generating new business to offset these headwinds and their success will be key to containing our deposit costs regardless of where we see any rate cuts from the fed this year turning to the loan portfolio relationship driven growth remains our primary focus loan balances increased on an annualized basis during the quarter commercial lines of credit and owner occupied commercial real estate drove half of the quarters expansion and were the primary drivers of the new originations lastly on the loan book ill note that our customers had a number of projects in process which resulted in construction draw downs and the transition from construction financing to permanent financing during the quarter this activity accounted for the remaining portfolio growth our bankers remain focused on the activities that drive balance growth and customer deposits core fee income and relationshipbased loans and with that ill now turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks chris were committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive longterm shareholder value in line with our expectations our total capital ratio has increased more than basis points over the past year since we closed our merger with umpqua at for the parent company we are now at our longterm target the bank remains modestly below at so were on the cusp of all regulatory ratios exceeding our longterm targets however our tce ratio was at quarter end and we would like to see that ratio grow closer to before considering meaningful options for deploying excess capital we still expect to organically generate capital well above what is required to support prudent growth and our regular dividend providing us longerterm flexibility for additional returns to shareholders this concludes our prepared comments tory chris ron frank and i are happy to take your questions now didi please open the call for qa columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from david feaster of raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc you guys have been extremely busy since announcing the cost saving initiatives you know the cost saves have come through a lot earlier than i think we had expected i was hoping maybe you could help us think through some of the initiatives that are in place and where youre reinvesting some of those savings you talked about opening a few de novo branches i know youre always looking for new talent and have had several announcements and then just kind of how you think about that expense line trend over the course of the year would you expect to be fairly steady improvement or more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter to get to kind of those targets i mean youre already at the top end of the range right now clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well david as weve come to expect from you you pack a lot into question and there are several of us here at the table that can provide insight so ill kick it off and then youll probably hear from tory chris and ron as well ill start with in my prepared comments we had a year of running the company we set the original organizational design in place in january of so almost months before we could actually start operating the company on a combined basis and what we didnt want to do at that point in time was cut too deeply do things make cuts that would have a direct impact on customer facing areas of the company and we also kept some redundancy in place because as you know when you go through any type of merger let alone one of this size and where we blended the teams some people selfselect out and so we just felt like it was prudent to take the first year continually evaluate what was working well more importantly what we could do better and then make an assessment as to if its in the leadership role which leaders are going to be able to help push us forward to the level and degree that we expect and then if we have processes that didnt work and that i kind of alluded to that in my prepared remarks theres the opportunity i think longer term to reengineer some processes enhance and improve some automation thats going to be to a much lesser degree just kind of a continuous improvement get better every day type of mentality like what youve expected from columbia over the years the real what ill call right sizing the expense base work some of it was done in the first quarter before we even started talking about it some of the we did some branch consolidations we had some miscellaneous contracts that were able to renegotiate at the maturity columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 and then we had the fte initiative which came towards the end and then really the big number i mentioned million of annualized savings that have been announced just this month and that work started the first of the month and associates were notified and then we started that process so i would say that its going to trickle through the third quarter but the bulk of the effort will happen and be concluded in the second quarter but by time you get a full clean run rate of the entire scope of this initiative it will be the fourth quarter so thats why we put that number out there ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc and dave this is ron just one thing because you mentioned weve already achieved it today i would just reiterate that as we look back at  we did have some oneoff credits in the operating expense number that ended it turned million we pegged a normalized number at million when you think about goforward quarters as part of the ph saves kicking in in the middle and then expected range of million to million of  operating expense excluding cdi amortization clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah just sitting here today with what the numbers i threw out its million annualized thats done so if that helps you as youre kind of thinking about how to tune your model going forward david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect thats helpful and then maybe just as we think about the margin i think chris alluded to it i mean obviously one of the primary keys to the margin is going to be the core deposit trends so i guess im curious maybe youre thoughts on core deposits and some of the initiatives youve got in place it sounds like there were some really encouraging trends from that targeted deposit campaign million of core deposit growth im curious what else are you working on and maybe some other campaigns or initiatives that youre considering to help support core deposit growth especially on the nib front christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david i cant this is chris yeah i wont give you our complete playbook but i can give you some color i can give you some color to it and the retail campaign it shows what can be done with a little over branches and our focus and really going out and looking at that small business market well see theres a lot of work involved in that and theres a lot of referrals to follow up on and giving customers on boarded the teams worked extremely hard during that time so you know well look to take a little breather and id say look into the second quarter later into the quarter and well announce probably another focus maybe something very similar so thats one piece as far as the gathering of new names and pretty excited about the noninterest bearing balances that are coming in on that specific customer segment todate or i said in the prepared remarks actually as of last night were up to about accounts and million in deposits and those accounts are maintaining their balances are higher than our average balance that we currently have and they continue to come in at a nice pace weve got another five days or so to run the other pieces are really around we talked in the fourth quarter and we talked in the first quarter about those results about cds and things of that nature really looking at the roll on all of those where theyre coming in theres a lot less coming due in the second quarter as we had previously talked about the delta on that to where columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 todays rates are is nowhere near as great which is good news and then on the other side as we move throughout the year theres some opportunities all things being equal with rates as they are today we have some opportunities to begin to lower a lot of those rates as well so i dont have the specifics that i can share with you right this second but as i said as we go throughout the year well start to see that cd base change and start to bring those rates down as well torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey david this is tory i want to just add a couple of things to it on the commercial side weve identified couple of i think big pieces in the commercial side of the house where weve got a lot of opportunity for some deposit growth i mean most notably our finpac portfolio and our multifamily portfolio which traditionally have been more transactional indiscernible plan in place to go after and make them fullfledged customers and relationships for the company so feel very good about just kicking that off and hoping to see some really strong results as the year progresses david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then maybe just touching on credit more broadly you talked about recalibrating the cecl model could you maybe touch a little bit about what went into that and kind of the methodology there it looks like we increased reserves on cre and maybe reduced a little bit to commercial and then but more broadly it seems like finpac is kind of stabilized a bit curious what happened to that one commercial credit which was the larger driver of losses and then just again broader commentary on what youre seeing on the credit front ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah dave this is ron ill start off on the front just in terms of the cecl models themselves id characterize it as just a better reflection of the combined companys historical loss experience within the commercial and in the recalibration of those models to drive towards that lower reduction but youre right it was a bit of a shift right a little lower in commercial just given lower historical loss rates a little bit higher in the commercial real estate categories again and those are based off of not loan level items those are based of economic forecasts for rents and vacancies in western downtown core slightly deteriorating quarteronquarter so thats something were seeing on the ground with our customers just given the composition of the portfolio but it is one of the drivers of the cecl models and frank ill turn it over to you for the second half of that about ph credit overall and finpac frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah finpac continues to perform as we expected it to to your point i mean it is the losses have peaked they are leveling out and well have a period of leveling out before we see it notably drop and we expect that drop somewhere around the third quarter continuing on through the yearend as we migrate back down to that ish run rate in charge offs we consistently do a deep dive within that portfolio and slice and dice it every which way looking for patterns of any other systemictype activity developing within the portfolio and we see that its really not what we are seeing as is in particular in the to 90day delinquency bucket which is a key delinquency range that a great deal of those feed into nonperforming and eventually the loss were seeing that decrease so those levels are at lowest levels that weve seen in several quarters so thats very columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 encouraging that a lot of the work we did many quarters ago to tighten up underwriting standards and the model are indeed working so that is encouraging and with regard to the cre in particular multifamily office i continue to be just extremely impressed at the resiliency of the portfolio especially in those two verticals that are under the watchful eye of so many right now really nothing exciting going on within either one of those portfolios its really quite boring which somebody like me loves to see and so im very pleased and lets we continue to watch all these portfolios extremely closely for changes and for us its important to stay ahead of it and thats what were doing david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific i appreciate thanks for the color everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you david frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from jared shaw of barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good afternoon thanks for the questions yeah maybe looking at first at capital youve been able to grow capital really nicely and as you said get your longterm targets does this provide opportunity to maybe look at accelerating or seeing better growth on the loan side earlier than expected or is the outlook for earning asset growth really more market driven than capital driven at this point clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah its from my perspective its more market driven we continue to see even its a psychological phenomenon with our customers and some of them where rather than borrow money at high low even though theyre getting and in terms of their cash so from a net spread standpoint its really not much different than before the fed started tightening but psychologically they havent for over a decade seen borrowed money at those rates and so theyre just using their own cash some are just kind of sitting on the sidelines waiting for opportunities to see if maybe some of their competitors struggle and theyre able to do some things there so theres a little bit of people keeping some dry powder using their own cash and then just more of a demand side columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 i would say its the funding side more than anything we saw an influx of deposits and we might look at ways of growing earning assets but right now our focus is the loan to deposit ratios at a level that were comfortable with we could see that go a little higher wed be comfortable with that but were not really actively looking to grow the balance sheet its more along the lines of the expense initiative and everything else its about driving improved profitability for the company i dont know if tory or chris or ron have a different perspective or an additional perspective torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no same thing obviously this is tory i just think that i talk a little bit about pipeline pipeline has been pretty steady over the last two or three quarters but the shift the mix has changed and its kind of shifted where weve got some nice growth on the ci front in the pipeline and then a reduction in real estate which is absolutely in line with everything weve been talking about for a while and it really fits the strategic direction for the company so feel positive about the opportunities throughout the franchise to grow the ci book jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks yeah and actually i guess sort of correlated to that your looks like the cre capital concentration is below sort of that threshold now would you like to see that continue to trend lower or do you feel comfortable with where the mix of the loan portfolio is here and future growth will just more be dependent on the market or should we expect you to continue to bring that concentration lower clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i think over the long term you will see that that drift down and thats back to torys comment regarding the ci pipeline the relationship aspect our ci customers they own real estate we have relationships some of our wealth management customers are in the real estate business were always going to be active in the cre space but i think that the focus on as a combined company the things that were able to do now that individually maybe we couldnt or we couldnt fully do i think youre going to see that level that concentration level will stay under that over the long run that doesnt mean there wont be variability from quarter to quarter we have commitments out there that are funding right now and driving some balances on the cre side but if were fast forwarding months i would fully expect to see that under jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon i wanted to try to chase down the loan and deposit growth expectations for this year i think youve talked about relationshipdriven loans and the moves youve made on the deposit side but i just trying to get a good direction of is that kind of lowsingledigit growth for both columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah jeff this is tory ill start and chris can chime in i think thats well said lowsingle digits for both with the mix on the loan growth side as best as we can to make that ci focused but as clint said there are some growth this quarter that is just construction projects indiscernible construction but the lending side that the primary focus is going to be ci and its full banking relationship so what comes with it is as much on the deposit front as possible large operating accounts and noninterest bearing balances and then i think a really strong robust core fee income pipeline so chris do you want to add to that christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no not on the loan side but on the deposit side thats a good target i would look at theres a lot of variables that could come into that how long does inflation remain where its out jeff and how much money keeps coming out of the system those are obviously going to impact it so were focused on if we can drive the new relationships across the bank both retail wealth and into commercial as well and drive relationship deposit growth and its really focusing much more on what that mix is and keeping the cost as low as possible if we were to go out and run a promotion and put a big rate out there we could certainly drive deposits but those wouldnt be necessarily the right type of deposits for the longterm strategic plan of the company but again a good place to start i think theres a lot of variables but the teams are going to roll up their sleeves and work really hard to keep driving relationships jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks and one quick one on the margin i think in the deck youve kind of cautioned that maybe ph that havent seen the cycle floor yet and that would be reflective of your guide the range is right in the middle of the i want to just if we were to pick that apart it sounds like second quarter given seasonality that maybe youd caution maybe on that if you were to be in that range youd be on the lower side and be sort of exiting the year potentially trending towards the higher end is that correct in terms of thinking more pressure upfront in the year and easing especially given sort of deposit rates and whats occurring in the first quarter ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jeff this is ron here and thats close and again the bigger driver over the course of the year where we end up in that range indiscernible core deposit flows even more so than if the fed cuts three times or doesnt move right thats given how neutral we are relatively neutral indiscernible more so based off of deposit flows so seasonally we usually see tax time dda outflows and then they rebuild into  so you could see that fluctuation within the range driven by that well see jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from ben gerlinger of citi your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i know that you guys gave quite a bit of color on the margin already but the repricing of deposits is clearly the biggest hit for this one for you i know you gave guidance that the kind of pig in the python here is much less there than it was in deposit pricing i am just curious can you quantify what the next six months or so in terms of what yield might be and any sort of specials that are running on indiscernible just on pricing in general for the next six months christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc so ben this is chris ill start with the pricing aspect of it that yeah theres no plan for promotional types of true promotional special types of pricing its really its a pricing that we have out there we continue to monitor it to the market and where we want to be within that range some of it obviously depends on what competitors do and whats out there we have the ability to exception price if we need to match a competitor or something like that i think that if you look at some of the other things and you look at the peak of the rates money markets were around theyre down to to cds peaked at about those are down to to and that includes a lot of factors that are in there and those are really just kind of the posted rates i think over the course of the year weve talked previously about second quarter we have a lot lower repricing of cds and then itll build back into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter now when it builds into the third and the fourth quarter those are on at rates that are ill call them higher than they are today and so all things being equal we should have a nice reduction from where theyre currently at to where they would renew and continue to move forward so hopefully that answers your question benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yes that was helpful color and then i saw that on pages slide weve broadening presence across the phoenix denver salt lake vegas all the way to kind of west coast cities that you dont have a huge presence indiscernible aspirational but thats its not like the next months to really kind of indiscernible the next target phases to think about just trying to how to frame it relative to today clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc were in all of those cities all the dots you see on the maps were there weve been there we put our first retail location in the utah market last fall weve had teams in colorado we actually have the next phase of that is to columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 support those teams with retail banking capabilities and deposit taking capabilities and we have the projects in flight to do that in colorado actually this quarter we will open two retail locations in the phoenix metro market its really its a i think how to think about those markets is its full banking services but its really leading with commercial banking and so its a branchlight type model thats different than what we have in our legacy markets here in the northwest where weve been for years and where weve built our market share by acquiring a lot of banks so in this instance were able to specify exactly which locations which communities we want to be in which ones are conducive to our strategy and our business model some of the work that were doing on the expense front is really to its just a reallocation of resources its how do we free up resources so that were not an outlier on an expense standpoint but that were able to also drive future shareholder value and franchise value by having the appropriate presence in these very very robust desirable western markets torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey ben this is tory i just want to add something to clints comments i think are just spot on you know theres this idea of expansion into markets like utah and colorado and in arizona are very comparable to what i think both banks have done over the course of time to find a really good commercial team and put them in market and then have a supporting cast around them which eventually is a retail presence and some deposittaking capabilities to support it its interesting weve been in these markets all of them for about months or less maybe a couple of years at them very very most and all three are operating in the black and are very successful so its a great strategy i think its minimal investment out of the gate and then we just build on it from there so i think were all really happy with the way those things are working out and then i think ph clint kind of said southern california is just a place where weve done that over the course of the years and have been very very successful and theres just so much opportunity with the density of number of customers or companies that exist down in southern california thats just a logical further continued investment for us benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it thats helpful color thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 good afternoon timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe looking again at the margin i just want to see the margin for the month of march is that fully baking in the price reductions on the wholesale and promotional fundings or does that actually trend higher maybe as that effect fully kicks in and then you get some of the more moderate pricing pressures off of that base ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc this is ron it bakes in a good chunk of it just given the majority of that those adjustments were in february so when you look at the month of march itself there were still reductions throughout the month but the majority occurred prior too timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then on the upside it looks like just the oneoff items mentioned in the appendix thats a core expense of ron you had mentioned that normalizes that that it kind of cut off as you mentioned what that driver was just whats the tie back from that that looks to be core versus the normalized we should be using ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah is definitely the number to be using there just a handful of oneoff items that happen to be credits so just various credit entries whereas in the fourth quarter they were mostly debit entries timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just last for me the migration of credit on the sba specifically we saw another competitor today talked to similar trends i know you guys are a big sba lender in your geography can you just remind us the size of that portfolio and maybe some nuances about it what portion of that is guaranteed and maybe some other characteristics of that portfolio frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc its about this is frank its about million and theyve historically done a lot of business acquisition type financing and thats really where the losses have been centered as it is in that specific space and obviously business acquisition smaller borrowers those are the ones in a rates up environment in a higher rate environment are going to be adversely impacted and thats what youre seeing i mean its in no way indicative of more of a spread than that and the guarantees on those credit obligations can run anywhere from to so the escalation that you saw in the npls attributable to sba is i mean should they go to loss they will generally be guaranteed by some portion on average its about and the balance of the increase timur is really centered in a single credit in the ci space of which we are well collateralized and there is significant interest in this particular property and i expect this one will probably be gone within the next quarter or two at the latest columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc timur this is tory i think itd be good just to kind of highlight a strategic shift in our sba business as we had historically been a more i think fullfledged nationwide lender looking for gain on sale and kind of restructured and through a strategic initiative to have a focus sba group to focus exclusively on referrals from retail banking and commercial banking and customers of the bank and just kind of changing the business model a bit which i think will bring us in footprint and have us focus quite nicely like we do everywhere else in the company where its about full relationship banking and its about our existing customers or new prospects that we bring into the company so a shift for us but i think a really good shift timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the questions operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from brandon king of truist your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey could you please characterize the deposit noninterest bearing deposit outflows you still seeing i believe some of the commentary is around inflationary pressures but wondering if some of that is also attribute to mix shift ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey brandon this is ron i think ph here early in the same quarter its going to be mostly tax related seasonally where both banks have seen their combined in the first quarter again it was a continuation of the trends from  in the month of january but then initiatives underway helped in february march as balances were flat which was great to see christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah this is chris ill add to that yeah the mix it continues to have some shifting in it higher for longer is going to continue that customers are going to continue to look at that and continue to make choices and decisions we follow it on that the money actually leave doesnt leave our balance sheet and were seeing it either be spent or were seeing it shift into higher earning products brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and what would you attribute i guess the portions of the into higher earning products versus being spent clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 brandon indiscernible just on the commercial side of the house which is indiscernible but its really closer to three quarters of what excess noninterestbearing just gets repriced into a interestbearing account whether money market or whatever and then the balance of that at this point over the last couple of quarters has been spent on either distributions taxes dividends et cetera so thats a rough ballpark of what weve seen brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay very helpful and then with the changes in how youre pricing certain deposits could you talk about the retention of those same deposit categories has that been affected at all and if just the goal is to kind of whatever you lose from a retention standpoint to kind of make up with these new initiatives christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah that most of that comes in brandon in the cd portfolio that we track that to where pretty much on given month we renew approximately of our cds either renew move into a different in different term or they auto renew and so that number has been very consistent over time it can vary it can vary based on what our rates are at the time but we can lay that over the next months and really kind of have a good idea of all things being equal where we want to be and so we can control a bit of that renewal activity but thats a pretty solid number for what rolls over each and every month brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thanks operator thank you operator instructions one moment for our next question and our next question comes from andrew terrell of stephens your line is open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon andrew columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc clint just quickly on the i think i heard in your prepared remarks discussion around kind of the tce ratio and targeting there versus i think youre at today weve talked about kind of the total risk based capital target of for a few quarters now i guess i just am curious what kind of drove that kind of change in the line of thinking and maybe more focus on the tce ratio now just given weve talked about the total risk base for a while clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah no its a good clarifying question i dont know its been probably years since columbia kind of set its longterm target capital ratios and what we always said was total risk base or tce and where weve been focused on are those regulatory ratios theyre not really out of alignment if you look at i think were roughly is what we expect to be total risk base at the bank level parent company as i mentioned is next quarter quarter and a half the bank should move to that level at the same time thats going to push tce up and then if you just look at where were at with aoci and you add that back in youre pretty much in the ballpark of an tce ratio so i dont think its too far off but i just think that its something that we do monitor we have monitored for a long period of time i think its artificially lowered because of the capital impact of the rate marks with purchase accounting and then just where were at right now with current rate levels that doesnt mean that thats a hard floor that doesnt mean that we wont look opportunistically the market i personally believe the market has our valuation wrong and has for the last couple of years and so it doesnt mean that when theres volatility and theres opportunities that we wont take strategic advantage of when we feel like that thats gotten even outsized from where it should be but just broadly want to get that out there that anything thats very major or meaningful in terms of shifting numbers and calculations probably wont occur until were within eyesight of that tce level andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah understood okay i appreciate the clarification there and then maybe just one a lot of my were asked and addressed already but the million commercial loan that was charged off this quarter was that previously sitting in nonaccruals frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc no this is frank yeah during the quarter we had really an extraordinary situation develop pretty quickly in which ci relationship itself discovered a pretty complex and significant internal fraud which drove the company quickly into a bankruptcy situation and so given the nature of the fraud the uncertainty surrounding the true collateral various pending investigations going on presently and really future potential litigation we took the i would say decisive quick and conservative move to charge off the outstanding balance now and really look to recover any proceeds as we move through the process and given whats going on i think thats probably really all i can talk about with regard to the subject right now but thats really what drove that andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay understood i appreciate the added color there and thanks for taking the questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks clint maybe on the disclosure in the deck about a couple billion of loans that you dont give us longterm strategic but the rate environment doesnt lend to moving them i guess what is it about these loans and i guess what would it take for you to kind of flip the switch on those and dispose those or look to sell them clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well that kind of plays into the earlier question about cre levels and where we see those over the long run a checking account a wealth management relationship an operating account anything of that nature would change how i view the segment of the portfolio that weve kind of highlighted there in the slide deck those are predominantly the multifamily division portfolio and tory shuttered that about a year ago so thats a winddown portfolio the other one would be single family resi loans that we dont have any other relationship with and thats kind of a legacy product from when the home lending group was structured more like a mortgage company as opposed to how we have it structured today or how it was restructured just shortly before the merger closed which is truly a mortgage division of the bank that supports our customers and their activities and needs so thats some of the initiatives that i know chris and tory are working on is the rate environment buys them affords them time to go out and we have loans with these individuals and organizations and so can they convert them into a relationship and if they can then great that helps us on the deposit front and it would be something we would keep but if they cant then when market conditions are right well then well take a very hard look at exiting those out of the portfolio which then would also lower that cre concentration level christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then as my followup clint if we just zoom out like normalized charge offs right youve got the finpac book thats running higher but normalizing how do i think about normalized charge offs in this environment for the bank on a consolidated basis clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i think thats one of the things we talk about even internally is that the normalized level for finpac is what roughly frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc i would say to clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc and it was running what columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc or so and so we see that kind of coming back but then it skews the overall bank numbers so as we move forward well do a better job at trying to bifurcate so you can see kind of where finpacs at on a normalized level as well as where the banks at i think from an expectation standpoint frank correct me if im wrong but i mean what were seeing in terms of credit what were seeing in terms of the output of our cecl model probably look at that normalization in finpac and then just carve out what the banks experience has been over the last three or four quarters if i was running a model thats probably what i would model going forward frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thats fair i would say thats fair representation of what you should do yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks everyone question for you guys that maybe indiscernible hasnt been touched on is fee income and your expectations there i know its a smaller revenue contribution but i think maybe thats the only thing we havent touched on from pl what kind of expectations do you have there and i guess im somewhat interested in the wealth business and mortgage in particular torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey jon this is tory ill kick it off and then turn it over to chris on the wealth side i think when the two banks came together there were a few places where there were a lot of places we were excited about but there is a few places we were really really excited about and one of them is the fee income side because there were some products and some capabilities that i think umpqua bank brought in that the columbia bank customers had a need for and just not a product set to kind of serve it so we are our pipeline on the fee income side just continues to grow every single month and its a byproduct of a lot of hard work by all of the folks in the bank whether its retail or commercial or anywhere else and the growth has been i think id probably point out three areas in particular treasury management commercial card and then international banking would be kind of the three that i would see follow probably closely by merchants and again the pipeline is million and its moving up every day and its a really good thing for the company and for our customers and so we feel pretty confident about where we are and where were going with it columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah jon its chris yeah i would say in the mortgage where were at if you look back over the past couple of quarters is a really good spot its kind of settled into that range over the last couple of quarters focused much more on held for sale and as clint mentioned taking care of our customer base we still have portfolio product and well do that for customers but the mix is definitely shifted on there and as we move into the summer season when youre looking at its predominantly purchase business there is a bit of refi in there still whether you start moving into the summer a little bit we may see a bit of an uptick in the overall production second quarter third quarter and all things being equal with rates as they are today the wealth business if you recall we did our platform conversion during the fourth quarter last year in october and im pretty happy to say that thats settled in extremely well the advisors understand the system theyre communicating with their customers the customer experience has improved dramatically from the system we were the broker dealer were with before and so i think that shows some real signs of upward mobility as we continue to move beyond that conversion and then on the trust side were getting more and more opportunities working with our partners within the bank especially within the commercial side where weve got business sales weve got lots of owners and that is really becoming a part of the team working together and the pipeline there is better than its been in the past so pretty exciting there well look to move into some of our newer markets in those spaces its a matter of finding the talent jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you thank you on that and then maybe clint one last one for you you seem pretty laser focused on top quartile type performance and i would just ask what do you look at specifically for that and i know youre frustrated with the valuation but as analysts we look at return on tangible and how that how your price to tangible book looks and if you can continue to put up these kinds of indiscernible your stock price should clearly go up but what are you looking at how do you measure that success and how do you think that stuff looks by the end of the year when this efficiency program is fully kicked in clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah well we certainly do look at our return on tangible and that has been on a peer comparison level that has been favorable but we also have a lower ratio our view is and i think in my prepared remarks i said across all financial metrics our view is pick a metric because from time to time things will look different you know theres things that are in focus at different times as you know but wherever our peer set is then we want to screen in the top quartile and if its on return on tangible if its roaa that somebody is looking at if its deposit mix composition pretty much anything along those lines and so thats i guess where were focused is the franchise that we thought we could create with this merger is here its in front of us weve been running it for a year and now what were doing is is internally we talk about its operational excellence and what are the things that we can do to improve those operations and rightsizing the expense base we were an outlier if we looked at the expense ratio we were an outlier we knew that we had year one which was keep our people keep our customers and drive value across the organization now were in year two the imo was shut down were focused on now delivering the full capabilities and the full financial performance and earnings power of this company its a difficult environment its difficult for everybody but thats okay thats one of the reasons that we did this merger was to give ourselves additional scale and columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 resiliency to navigate through any type of business cycle so probably more than what you wanted on this but i would say pick a metric and if were not there were looking at how do we get our company into that top quartile jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right fair enough thank you very much i appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you id now like to turn it back to clint stein for closing remarks clint
