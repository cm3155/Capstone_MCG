earnings release or website or our sec filings at this point id like to turn the call over to aaron to review our financial performance aaron james deer executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you clint first quarter earnings of million and eps of were an increase of million and respectively on a linkedquarter basis quarterly pretax preprovision earnings of million were down million due to the nonrecurring second quarter gain on sale of a portion of our visa class b restricted stock and subsequent writeup of the remaining shares that contributed million to that quarter total deposits ended the quarter at billion up million from june this supported a further reduction in fhlb borrowings and an increase in earning assets which together drove net interest income up by million when compared to the second quarter excess liquidities from the deposit inflows was mostly invested in loweryielding mortgagebacked securities combined with lower loan yields and other factors resulted in a basispoint drop in the net interest margin to of note ppp loans weighed on the margin by about basis points given the rate environment and outlook we anticipate rate pressure to continue but we have taken measures to mitigate this pressure including targeted adjustments to our deposit pricing purchases of agency securities with reduced prepayment risks and adding floors to new loan production our industryleading cost of deposits dropped by basis point to basis points ill also note that just last week we terminated our million notional value interest rate collar effectively locking in a gain on that collar to benefit the margin through february total loans ended the quarter at billion down million from june loan production was ripe for third quarter at million however production volumes increased sequentially throughout the quarter excluding ppp new loan production was brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which compares to the overall portfolio of noninterest income of million was a decrease of million after factoring out the onetime gains of million on the visa class b restricted stock and from the disposal of loans in the second quarter noninterest income was actually up million or increased transaction volume from the relaxation of shelterinplace orders drove card revenues and deposit service fees up by and respectively and loan revenue increased by million mostly from new mortgage loans originated and sold noninterest expense was million in the third quarter which was an increase of million on a linked quarter basis compensation and benefits expense increased by million principally due to the deferral of loan origination costs related to the ppp loan program in the second quarter this was offset by a million reduction in the provision for unfunded loan commitment included in other noninterest expense much of the remaining million noninterest expense variance was due to systems legal and professional and other various costs incurred in the second quarter to set up the ppp program and respond to the pandemic our noninterest expense ratio remained at for the quarter and our operating rate efficiency ratio increased about point to we expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to remain in the mid for the fourth quarter our effective tax rate for the quarter was and should remain in the to range for the full year columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 with that ill turn the call over to chris chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone our production teams have been actively engaged across our footprint securing new business and partnering with our clients to ensure they have what they need to run their businesses in addition our operations teams have been diligent and creative with finding solutions to support our relationship bankers and bringing the organization to the clients when needed while still complying with regulations and maintaining physical distance in the midst of both covid and the unusual fire season in our footprint over the past months additionally our team members have stepped into support each other when time was needed to assist with covid issues evacuations and heavy smoke we are very proud of our excellent team of bankers and feel this continues to set us apart the highlight of the quarter was continued strong deposit growth largely stemming from a combination of new client relationships economic stimulus and reduced spending by businesses and consumers coming off a record second quarter deposits grew by another million during the third quarter with growth evenly split between existing and new accounts the deposit mix shifted from business and consumer as of june to business and consumer at september the increase in business deposits is attributed to normal seasonality on the consumer side account balances were essentially flat as we saw an increase in debit card transactions as covid restrictions were relaxed and consumers resumed more normal spending habits from a product perspective deposits as of september were demand and other noninterestbearing and interest bearing our bankers have been busy rebuilding the pipeline amidst the pandemic and we generated new loan production as mentioned of million during the quarter which included million of additional ppp loans brought on in early july most of the new production was in ci and cre followed by family ag and construction loans loans overall decreased by million during the quarter to billion new originations were offset by net payments on existing loans of million payoffs of million and a reduction in line utilization of million the remaining decline was mostly due to loan prepayments our line utilization rate declined from at the end of the second quarter to driven by declines in construction followed by consumer and ci ppp loans gross of deferred fees were million at quarter end representing of total loans that should decline from here as we opened our forgiveness portal in midaugust and began receiving forgiveness statements from the fca in early october excluding the ppp loans the quarter production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio mix is now ppp loans nonppp fixed floating and variable residential mortgage activity accelerated in the third quarter driving noninterest loan revenue higher by million on a linkedquarter basis this has been a bright spot given the lower interest rate environment as a reminder columbia bank originates and generally sells its conventional production and portfolios to jumbos deposit service charges and card revenues increased by a combined million from a return to normalized transaction activity levels after the second quarter low caused by state governmentmandated shelterinplace orders we are continually optimizing our delivery strategy and have been proactive in consolidating branches columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 over the past several years expanding each branch of service coverage area given local market conditions and projected growth in the past five years we have consolidated branches representing approximately of our network with of those in the past three years as part of our ongoing branch rationalization process we announced the consolidation of two branches in the fourth quarter one in our coastal region consolidated this past weekend and the other in our puget sound region will occur in the next two weeks as clint indicated we also opened our newest neighborhub style branch in boise at the end of september which has been well received by the community now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thanks chris the provision under cecl of million reflects a strong  rebound negated by increased uncertainty going into consistent with my comments last quarter the momentum and path of the recovery will continue to be threatened by the coronavirus pandemic in general our forecast anticipates a second contraction in attributed to uncertain consumer reactions to rising case counts within the united states as we head into winter certainly the events that are currently unfolding in europe germany france italy and spain and what if any future government stimulus may look like will impact this therefore our modeling continues to reflect a more protracted recovery with slower gdp growth and an unemployment rate that remains elevated in as a reminder we use ihs markit for our economic forecast annualized gross domestic product is anticipated to decline in the fourth quarter of by followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter of where gdp grows as the economy begins to slowly exit the pandemic while the unemployment rate has retreated from its high in  we anticipate ending at close to due to the lasting effects of the coronavirus we also added an overlay to this quarter for what we consider highrisk commercial real estate basically hospitality office and retail and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant northwest employer these amounted to a combined million in additional reserves for the quarter we ended the quarter with a provision relative to periodend loans of adjusting for the ppp loans the allowance period in loans increases to npas for the quarter were relatively unchanged at basis points however i feel adjusting for ppp loans provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward into with this adjustment npas do increase but only by basis points so again relatively unchanged i would like to remind folks npas are still comprised of credits whose issues predate the pandemic past due loans for the quarter were basis points compared to basis points last quarter net chargeoffs annualized were basis points for the quarter versus basis points last quarter and our impaired capital ratio rose modestly from to so as alluded to earlier your standard credit metrics for the quarter were relatively stable columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 on the risk rating front loans rated watch or below was unchanged at just around billion we saw watch loans increase million going from million to million special mention loans declined million to million and substandard loans saw an increase of million and are now around million in total these changes increased our watch and below risk ratings from to of total loans again very stable metrics okay lets move on to deferrals at the beginning of the quarter we had close to billion in active loan deferrals at the close of the quarter we had million in active deferrals most of the deferrals today are in the hospitality portfolio which accounts for million of the active deferrals approximately twothirds of this amount represents loans in their second deferral period as mentioned before this is consistent with our strategy relative to the sector and does not cause us to be any more concerned than we were when we entered the first deferral with these borrowers at the end of the quarter the portfolios we had identified as being some of the first to be impacted by the pandemic which includes our hotel retail restaurants aviation and dental and healthcare portfolios amounted to a little over billion or roughly of our loan portfolio if we exclude the dental and healthcare portfolios which we are feeling much better about these days it falls to about billion or of our loan portfolio the largest portfolio we identified again was our dental portfolio as previously discussed we believe the impact on this portfolio is and was truly transitory today these practices are generating revenue at around to of prepandemic levels at this level of revenue generation most of these practices are operating above breakeven this is further evidenced by deferrals in this portfolio declining from of the portfolio to less than of the total portfolio during the quarter again a combination of deferrals and ppp loans are allowing these practices to move forward with little impact on the banks balance sheet similar to last quarter of the portfolio is rated pass watch and the remaining is evenly split between special mention and substandard the next largest segment we identified as having a higher risk relative to the economic disruption caused by covid19 is our retail portfolio we have approximately million in retailrelated exposure which is essentially unchanged from the prior quarter its split between commercial real estate and commercial business loans and represents about of the total loan portfolio the largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of commercial real estate loans which account for approximately million of the total it is evenly split between washington and oregon and as you would expect centered within the portland and seattle msa the average loan size is to give you an idea of the types of retail properties we finance the most common are small four to fiveday strip centers located in suburban communities we also do a fair amount of standalone singletenant properties which would be characterized as auto park companies home and gardenbuilding retailers as well as food and beverage stores also called convenience stores along with gas stations sporting goods and furniture stores in addition the portfolio contains groceryanchored centers and mixed use properties we are not in large downtown core metropolitan areas nor do we finance regional malls using at origination values the average loantovalue for the portfolio is with of the portfolio having a loantovalue less than we have stresstested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen during the great recession the average loantovalue rises to with about of the properties having a loanto value less than columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 for the entire retail portfolio is pass rated which is a slight improvement over last quarter when was pass rated for the balance of the portfolio at quarter end is watch is special mention and is substandard this breakdown is essentially unchanged from the first quarter deferrals in this portfolio declined from of the entire portfolio to less than of the portfolio obviously we are pleased with how this portfolio is performing but we remain cautious and our expectation is that we would see weakening in this portfolio as ppp funds become exhausted and deferral benefits subside this segment would greatly benefit by another round of stimulus in my opinion okay lets discuss hotels we have million in hotel loans representing about of our loan portfolio about is in major markets which would include the portland and seattle msas however we also have about of the hotel portfolio or million of exposure out on the oregon coast to give you an idea of the type of hotels we finance most have one of the following flags holiday inn best western choice marriott and wyndham in total flag properties comprise of the portfolio the average loan size is million today we have about million on deferral which is down from last quarter when approximately million was on deferral many of the loans on deferral today are on their second deferral which is consistent as i mentioned before with our strategy for this portfolio we anticipate the recovery in the hotel sector to be prolonged with this in mind we are working on a number of options for our clients which include usda programs the main street lending program along with more conventional solutions as well many of these plans were crafted in concert with our borrowers during the first deferral period we are now using the second deferral period to effectuate upon these strategies similar to the retail commercial real estate loans we continue to do stresstesting on this portfolio as well the average loantovalue for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is with of the portfolio having a loantovalue of less than on a stress basis about of the portfolio has a loantovalue less than nondental healthcare is about million in total similar to the dental portfolio we saw the impacts of the pandemic here to be transitory as well as individuals are once again able to see their orthopedist dermatologist optometrist and so on in addition elective surgeries such as hip replacements knee replacements cataracts are again being performed along with blood test mri sonograms and ekgs the breakout of the portfolio is as follows approximately million is veterinary another million are physician practices of varying kind and million is other types of healthcare providers such as chiropractors physical therapists and counseling services the average loan size is as of june of the portfolio is pass rated with on watch and rated substandard we had deferral requests for about million in total in this segment or roughly of the portfolio as of june today we have on deferral or less than of the portfolio as i mentioned earlier were feeling good about this portfolio okay restaurants and food services we have approximately million in this portfolio with twothirds comprising commercial real estate loans the average loan size is today is pass rated watch special mention and the balance is substandard we granted deferrals for about million in this portfolio but today we have on deferral or roughly million columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 similar to the hotel and retail segments we see this area taking some time to heal and while we are pleased with the performance of the portfolio we remain cautious here as well outside dining and such had a significant impact for many of these businesses but the colder months ahead will make it difficult for these revenue generating options to remain viable as such we anticipate additional stress in this segment in the months to come we do stresstesting on the cre portion of this portfolio and on a prepandemic basis the average loanto value was with having a loantovalue less than again on a prepandemic basis under our stresstest scenario average loantovalue rises to with only having a loantovalue of less than again the last portfolio im going to discuss is our aviation portfolio it is comprised of both direct exposure to domestic airline carriers as well as entities of leasing airplanes and engines to airline carriers in total the portfolio is about million with million being direct exposure to us domestic airline and the remaining million in exposure to lessors today most of the portfolio is rated watch which is an improvement over last quarter most of the upgrades have been centered in the domestic airlines segment thanks to the significant amount of capital our borrowers have raised yeartodate of the domestic airlines we have exposure to they have raised over billion in additional capital to assist them through this pandemic just this past quarter they raised an additional billion and have secured agreements with the us treasury for additional funding if needed as such this additional capital combined with expense reduction efforts results in all of our borrowers having over months of burn rate now this increase in burn rate was the primary driver for the upgrade from special mention to watch as it gives the airlines two years to adjust their business models relative to the impact that pandemic has placed on them most of our domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft with a prestress loan to value of and a current loantovalue we believe closer to on a stress test basis the loantovalue rises to as for the leasing portfolio of the exposure is in asia europe and north america the majority of the portfolio consists of narrowbody aircraft with an average age of years we view the younger more fuelefficient aircraft as being the most in demand postpandemic based on origination values our average loantovalue for the portfolio is however based on what we believe is todays value the loantovalue is closer to and on a stress test basis the loantovalue rises to okay with that back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks andy given our strong earnings stream and total capital of yesterday our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to million shares in addition to share repurchases we have a full menu of options for deploying excess capital including further investment in our business special dividends and should the right opportunity arise strategic ma we announced our regular quarterly dividend of this morning this quarters dividend will be paid on november to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now tamara we will open the call for questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions okay via the phone line you have a response on the line of david feaster please go ahead david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc hi david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i just wanted to get a sense of the competitive dynamics and thoughts on loan growth originations are down a bit just curious your appetite for new loans the competitive landscape the pulse of your clients and maybe just how your pipeline is trending and just any thoughts you might have going forward clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc ill start and then ill turn it over to chris to fill in some gaps and both chris and i have traveled extensively throughout our footprint met with bankers and our clients and andy has as well and every time we come back much more optimistic we see the things that are going on the opportunities that our bankers are getting a look at there is some disruption thats occurring within our market with some of the things that some of the large national banks are doing and thats creating opportunities for us as well i think from a production standpoint we saw in terms of what it was down it was on a percentage basis pretty similar to what we experienced in the second quarter but what weve seen with the pipelines is consistent in terms of the rebuilding there with the things that i just mentioned that our bankers are getting a look at and so it gives us a lot of optimism its still a tough and very competitive environment the yield curve is definitely unfavorable and things of that nature but the team of chris aaron and andy are working very hard with all of their folks on making sure that were capturing new business that were deepening the relationships that we have and that more importantly that were finding a home for all of that liquidity that has found its way to our balance sheet in the last six months and with that ill step back and let chris provide his perspective chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thanks clint and good morning david yeah i would say that to echo clints comments that the pipeline is moving in the right direction we are i would say cautiously optimistic with everything that andy talked about and what potentially is down the road we have to be very cautious in looking at credits and what we can were columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 comfortable bringing on but the good news is with all of that considered in the extra time it takes at a covid overlay and say were cautiously optimistic and it is moving in the right direction the environment in and of itself you can see the new loan yields and what they come on at i expect that to probably continue with the yield curve where its at and just the environment in general with excess liquidity new loan volume is paramount for everybody and i think were winning our fair share and again cautiously optimistic as we move forward david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then i know youve only got two out there and one weve just implemented but how do you think about the performance of these neighborhubs and whats your plans for growth of this concept going forward is this a good way for organic market expansion and kind of beta test the market to potentially backfill with liftouts or ma and just capitalize on some of this disruption that youre talking about or just how do you plan to use this concept going forward chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah thanks for the question the concept in and of itself were talking about branches that are less than typically square feet different concept within it its not built around transactions first its built more around solutions and consultation and sharing some of the digital options that are out there and available the two have been well received in the areas that they are it certainly is a lot easier to go into a new market at square feet than what you would have seen in a traditional manner years ago and well continue to look at that for where the concept fits the community rooms and things of that nature to draw people into that space you do need some population centers and all of that but i think the best thing about them is were using the concept to then how do we use that to get into our traditional branch network where maybe we have a square foot branch and how can we downsize it how can we do other things using the same model we have a few of those out there that are being piloted right now and were pleased with the results i wouldnt say that were rushing out to put a bunch of brandnew branches into areas but were certainly looking at it as part of the strategy where we can support our commercial teams and our other relationship bankers where they are having great success driving loan volume and what will really take them to the next level is full commitment of regional branching clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc and ill just add on to that that with the first neighborhub that we opened a little over two years ago and then with the one in boise theyre learning labs and thats really what chris was getting at is how can we take some of the technology their staffing model is different and how can we learn from that and apply that to our existing network and so even though the physical facility may not change we can drive some efficiencies through learnings from these neighborhubs and i think thats probably our greatest opportunity over the next two to four years on our with our retail banking group is applying that across the entire network the actual changing of the physical footprint of the branch is its much more complex especially if its leased so theres a lot of different i guess dynamics at play here but i columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 think its much more than just having a concept thats in certain markets i think the bigger potential is what we do with the learnings from that david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and just following up on that we talked in the past cost savings is really just a part of your dna it sounds like this might play into that just wanted to get your thoughts on expenses and how this concept potentially downsizing some branches and using other various initiatives that you might have to combat the revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures and how do you think about expenses going forward clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc were all looking at each other because that question was a pretty dynamic one and it touches many different aspects and in terms of well let aaron here in a minute talk about what hes thinking for the run rate but i think that kind of building on on our response to the last question really people and occupancy are our two largest line items and when we think about the neighborhub and how its staffed versus a traditional regional branch model where a lot of the activities there are paying and receiving the neighborhub staffing concept is really geared towards sales and consulting and we think that with the digital tools that we have available today and the things that weve invested in and the things that will come down through our pipeline in the next to months as well as the acceleration thats occurred as a result of covid and stayinplace orders we think that will help accelerate that transition from that paying and receiving function to the sales and consulting functions so you have fewer people that are better able to i guess do a wider variety of things and that equals less downtime if that makes sense and thats where i think that the real opportunity lies in terms of just from the staffing standpoint the technology piece and this is what chris alluded to earlier were piloting and some of our higher volume branch locations is it works great and a de novo branch thats building its customer base if we add thousands and thousands of transactions daily transactions onto that process break and thats what were testing now and challenging our folks to do and how do we take that technology and simple things like dual custody and there are some things weve done with the neighborhub that have given us some efficiencies there actually given social distancing requirements in our branches its been great to know that we have a different process where you dont have to have two people counting money two feet apart from one another chris did i im sure i missed a lot in that response chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc i think you captured it pretty well and david i think you captured it pretty well in the beginning when you said its part of our dna and its consistently something that were looking at and evaluating all the time and thats why youve seen the progress over the years and it may be indiscernible as we evaluate its not a big rash decision or anything like that its part of our ongoing strategy around our values and what we bring to the table for our clients by being there for them columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 and the neighborhub and the concept within it is equipping our bankers to be more outbound and turning that from because those are de novos there are obviously as not as many transactions that are walking in the door so how are they turning that and being more outbound into reaching out to clients sharing with them all the things we do youve seen the results in the mortgage group right now because of the rate environment were reaching out clients making sure that they know we do do mortgages our financial services and trust departments and many of the other things were much more proactive in that aspect and i think thats where you look down the road to what can we accomplish in those areas to help offset some of the stuff that weve already done but also that we will continue to do and ill let aaron add anything else on run rate and such aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yes hopefully we continue to see the provision for unfunded commitments in the drift down in the right direction heading into the fourth quarter and i could see some project costs that might tick up a little bit and theres always kind of some yearend trueups and things but were still feeling pretty good about that mid run rate even if it might tick up indiscernible this quarter and then heading into next year well probably look to give some guidance on that next quarter but i think what youre going to continue to see is just as we continue to find ways to streamline certain areas well look to redirect those resources in some more revenuegenerating areas and try to increase our overall productivity over time david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful great color and great quarter thanks everybody aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thanks david operator thank you your next response from the line of jon arfstrom please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc great you talk a little bit about the approach on reserves it seems like youve built in quite a bit of conservatism in with the worsening and some of the overlays that youve put in maybe andy for you what would need to happen to drive the need for more reserves it feels like youre adequately reserved at this point but what would need to materially change for those reserve levels have to go up again columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc well i think that the biggest wildcard is the pandemic still and if our footprint goes back into a situation where businesses get shut down i think there are places across the country like el paso for example and then you look at whats occurring in europe there are chunks in the portfolio that i alluded to that seem to have weathered the first storm but to weather another storm backtoback would be very difficult so thats probably the biggest wildcard is how the pandemic continues to evolve jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay but it seems like youve built in some of that thinking into the overlay that you put in place is that fair andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah we believe that the model itself still relies to a certain degree on historic numbers you got to go a long way back where we had losses and so your loss given default we have some concerns there for some particular segments that i outlined and then of course the announcement of the dreamliner leaving the pacific northwest and going to south carolina while we dont have necessarily a lot of direct exposure to boeing it will have a community ripple and we believe its prudent for us to acknowledge that and somehow add that into our reserve and that is so unique and specific to a particular part of our footprint its not going to be captured in sort of national gdp and unemployment numbers jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay fair enough and then i want to touch on the margin and some of your expectations because you clearly called it out in the release again aaron but can you talk a little bit about the decision to terminate the collar some of the steps you can take to offset some of the pressure and i guess the big picture is do you feel like the way youre set up now that you can continue to grow with net interest income from here thanks aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jon its aaron with respect to the collar i think that just reflects our expectation that the benefit that could be had there was in terms of down rate risk is kind of washed out wed really have to see rates go negative to yield any additional benefit there whereas if we do see rates move higher the gain in that would have diminished so it just felt like the right time to lock that in and i would note just to be clear that that is a the benefit of that has been in the run rate and will then remain in the run rate as a result of having locked that in so youre not going to see an additional benefit from that it is in the existing run rate in terms of the margin expectations in general i would obviously like to have a more optimistic view but its given where rates are and the shape of the yield curve right now i think were likely to continue to see some pressure there at least on a core basis now if you look back over the past couple of quarters we are effectively down and im just going to use round numbers but down say basis points of that is excess liquidity weve got from the securities portfolio another on over loan yields ppp is basis points and weve got some offsetting benefit on the funding side thats probably basis points the liquidity and the ppp should go away over time right but as youre getting those funds redeployed into higher yielding assets or pulling it out of fed funds or turning in and getting that into securities and loans at this columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 point most of it is going into the securities portfolio and youre still looking at sub and so its youre picking something up there but its not as though youre going to be getting it back to the kind of yield that youd be getting if were driving that into loans or if we were in a better rate environment so theres going to be some volatility in it as the ppp stuff pays down both from having the loweryielding aspect of that go away but also realizing the fees on that and just to give you a sense of where we are there weve got about million of unearned income on those ppp loans that will be either amortizing in or being recognized as the loans are forgiven and so thats all going to add some volatility especially over the next probably two three quarters as those forgiveness the bulk of that gets forgiven presumably so theres a lot of noise but i think underlying it all is going to be some continued pressure on the core margin jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and the dollar i guess the dollar amount net interest income feels like youve got some liquidity to deploy as well but do you feel you can defend the nii level aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc that is our objective and i think that given the confidence that i think you heard chris talking about in terms of some building pipelines and whats happening on that front that we should be able to see better loan growth and that should be able to help us hit that target clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yes ill just add as aaron went through the items that impact the margin and all the variables that are included in that it makes it a challenge to zero in on and tell you that we expect basis points of expansion or contraction or anything of that nature and so as we have conversations internally at our alco and with our key line of business leaders our conversations are really centered around net interest income and what those targets look like and what the opportunities for expanding net interest income are and i think thats the bright spot as aaron mentioned were getting basis points on overnight funds as we move those into even if it is the securities book theres a pickup in nii so thats very much our focus given the current rate environment and the current amount of liquidity that we have jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yep i agree i agree thats a more important number so thanks for the help everyone i appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you your next response from the line of jeff rulis please go ahead jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc hello jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co just a followon perhaps it strikes me as a bigger question maybe for the industry too is just the liquidity in the system and in your discussions clint you touched on it a bit im maybe interested in the outlook of the outflow of liquidity and timing in are we going to be stuck with this for a while or the pace of that liquidity surplus any thoughts that you guys have shared internally about how that plays out in clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thats the billion question for us and its a great question weve spent a lot of time over the last couple of quarters thinking about that and the stickiness of it and then for us its compounded because we typically have seasonal inflow of deposit growth that occurs in the back half of any given year and so really trying to bifurcate between what are search deposits and what are normal growth and i mentioned some of the activities of our bankers and theyre out winning new business and some of that business are very very significant deposit relationships and so we have that noise that gets added in and of course we have all the details but you cant get there from just seeing a growth number year todate or quarteroverquarter but that stickiness is something that weve challenged ourselves to think about and walk through we talked about ppp forgiveness well in order to get forgiveness they had to spend the money and so when we think about almost billion of those deposits it could be related to ppp and its actually a few hundred million more than that because we have depositors that obtain ppp elsewhere and put the money with us and so then its trying to peel back the layers of the onion and figure out how much of that is just customers greening up how much of it is that there there have been great years some of them are doing very very well and theyre just sitting on the cash because either for their own investment purposes or reinvestment in their business they want more certainty so its a very complex issue and thats been part of the struggle that aaron and the team have had in terms of how much to put back into the bond market and ill let aaron and chris jump in and add their perspective because i know that this is a not quite daily but almost daily conversation between the two of them chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yes this is chris and it is almost daily i think theres a couple of things that i would add to that that remain to be seen and some of it is is there another round of stimulus deposits have accumulated through basically lower spending but as clint mentioned some of the businesses are what i would describe as thriving do they choose to make an investment at some time do they pull those funds out and put them somewhere else in an investment aspect were always trying to encourage with us indiscernible that but well see how that part of it plays out columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 and then on the other side of that are people who are maybe humping down a little bit more and are being very conservative because theyre not sure what the winter holds for them or what is the crystal ball saying they may start to spend some of that money just to staying in business and things of that nature so i think another round is stimulus would tell us a lot about whats going to happen there id be more comfortable if i knew what was coming and what has been announced and i could probably say its a little stickier but i think youre in between those two things and as of today and in our continued conversations we continue to see it remains to be sticky and then you see the results for the second quarter and it grew outside of our normal seasonal activities and with that ill let aaron add anything aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc no i would just say that we continue to do a lot of analysis and try to understand the depositor behavior but i think clint and chris did a good job kind of summing that up jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co i appreciate the thoughts there and my other question in the who knows variety again but andy you touched on the winter months and given your northwest exposure on the hospitality side the restaurants maybe hotels as you talk to borrowers and they prepare for maybe colder months i guess is that you get the sense that thats indeed a tougher environment versus a group thats maybe a little more adept at managing a new normal or as theyve changed their business practices trying to get a sense for at some point its a black or white being outside or indoors but can they weather that into the winter and what are borrowers saying to that andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah i think that the easiest example to talk about is the portfolio of hotels out on the oregon coast with people not able to travel to places overseas or not comfortable getting on an airplane or yes i can go to hawaii but my twoweek vacation is stuck in quarantine a lot of those folks had what turned out to be record summer certainly back in spring it looked a lot worse when everybody was canceling but in the end people flock to the oregon coast and we saw that same consistent behavior with where we have hospitality properties for example indiscernible and some of the more vacationtype places well now the key is did they generate enough liquidity to get to the next summer season because one of the things that will be different this winter is that out on the oregon coast they would still have business meetings they would have different organizations that would get together people who collect barbie dolls or collect coins or have an interest in something right they get together and have a convention well those meetings arent going to occur this winter and so that incremental cash flow wont be there so the amount of liquidity that they accumulated coming out of what was a very successful summer season we now have to project out if thats going to be sufficient to get them to the next summer season and thats exactly what were working with our borrowers on and business owners are generally optimistic people so theyre feeling pretty good especially indiscernible coming out of and again as clint mentioned a lot of us have traveled around the footprint and it has been very encouraging to see how businesses have already adapted to a lot of these challenges so i always come back feeling a lot better columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 but nevertheless right now the story is still how much liquidity you have and if you generated that liquidity because you had record attendance at your hotel occupancy during the summer or if you were able to boost your revenues with outside dining did you do it enough to get you through those cold winter months and thats the conversations that were having and of course those conversations are ongoing and well know more as we get to the end of the fourth quarter because well be able to assess that and thats why i remain cautious in those segments jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yep that helps thats it for me thanks guys andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thanks jeff operator thank you your next response is from jackie bohlen please go ahead jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc hi jackie jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc you had really good trend so far in what youve been submitting for forgiveness it appears to be a little bit higher than some of the other conversations ive been having just curious as to what you and i know theres a lot of interpretations but just curious as to what you think the timing might be for getting forgiveness for some of the portfolio this quarter versus chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah jackie this is chris weve had good response to we opened up our portal back in august and weve actually had about a third of the as far as numbers go that have applied to forgiveness so weve had a little over have applied its a couple of hundred million dollars we dont expect to probably get that level back this year so some of it most likely and aaron alluded to it earlier probably looking into the first second quarter next year and maybe some of it trails even into the third quarter but theyre starting to trickle in i wouldnt say that its fast by any means and were again were seeing that about third of the borrowers if you will have applied for forgiveness already jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 okay okay thank you thats helpful and then it was a very interesting comment that you had in both the press release and i think it was part of the prepared remarks as well in terms of just working to retain talent during a challenging environment given what people have going on in their personal lives how has retention been now versus how it was say a year ago chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc retention id say has actually been pretty good were finding creative ways to work around issues distance learning things of that nature so we can be a little bit flexible other team members are stepping in to help and so weve been able to minimize a little bit of that turnover i think im probably more optimistic of the talent that were starting to see that is wanting to come to work with us from all the disruption that is going on and the things that youve seen out there there are very highquality bankers that are calling us and reengaging in conversations and thats always a positive jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and that clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc ill just add a couple of points early on in the pandemic the first few months we saw a small uptick in folks that were at or beyond what you would consider a normal retirement age that elected to retire i think the uncertainty and strain of coming to work in a pandemic environment was more than they wanted to deal with so we did see a little bit of that and it was understandable i think as chris mentioned some of the things that were seeing in terms of outreach from other bankers across our footprint one of the biggest challenges that as a management team that weve been very focused on is maintaining our culture and thats challenging when youre in a remote work environment and i think that weve done a really good job as a team of maintaining that culture and keeping folks connected to our organization and i think thats what were seeing with other organizations that maybe have struggled in that regard and were starting to get that outreach from some of their employees and so thats an encouraging i guess an encouraging time from our perspective in terms of what we think well be able to do from an organic standpoint as we move forward jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay no thats great and you actually answered the second part of my question that was a followup to it and then i guess just lastly the two branches that you are closing in the fourth quarter is that included in the count of or just that it sums up to clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc it would sum up to columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks jackie operator thank you your next response is from matthew clark please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co maybe just on the deposit growth its been fairly robust here still and i just want to get a sense for where its coming from how much of its kind of existing customers versus new and whether or not theres anything unusual this quarter chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc i cant tell you unusual for the fourth quarter but for the third quarter it was pretty much a mix between new business as clint had mentioned some of our bankers have brought in some pretty significant new accounts and just existing clients increase some of that as the seasonal and some of its just the reduced spending habits on the consumer side as i mentioned we saw more of a return to normal or approaching back to normal with card spend and things of that nature so most of its been commercial its a bit of a its a mix in that and again were watching almost day we watch it daily and we talked about it frequently during the week and there hasnt been anything yet thats come out where i see a big runoff or something of that nature ill see if anybody wants to add anything to that but aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i would just say that the well i would certainly characterize a lot of whats happening on the deposit front as unusual theres nothing that was out of character we didnt add any broker or something like that that could bump that number up matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 okay and then just on the pipeline im not sure if you quantified that during your prepared comments but any color on the size of the pipeline either linked quarter yearoveryear and whether or not the expectation is you might be able to show net loan growth exag chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc matt we dont typically share the amounts for the pipeline i can tell you that yes its rebuilding on a yearover year comparison were not where we were in previous years but thats understandable based on the environment the positive is its rebuilding id say were cautiously optimistic into the fourth quarter of what that looks like some timing may kind of play up into the year closures and things of that nature matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on capital management i wanted to touch on the buyback and ma conversations i guess how aggressive might you get with the buyback and what if you could also give us an update on any commentary around ma in terms of active conversations whether theyve picked up clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yeah well the buyback has been one of the tools that weve used for capital management for a long period of time and we had the plan that expired in may and we wanted to just let some time pass and see how things played out with the pandemic and before we decided on what a new plan might look like and were looking at our current capital levels and were very comfortable with those were very comfortable with all the various scenarios weve done from a capital stress test point of view our expectation around the performance of the loan portfolio going forward our current acl level and then when we look at the market volatility thats there we just wanted the flexibility and felt like it was the appropriate time to bring that tool back into the mix and so i cant give you any specifics around levels or frequency or anything like that with it but i think youve followed us for a very long period of time and you know that weve been good stewards of capital and that weve used the combination of our regular dividend and ma and special dividend and share repurchases to manage those capital levels and were still significantly higher than the longterm goal that we have for total capital or tce so well be strategic with it and when it is appropriate well use that tool with respect to ma i think everybody is starting to kind of they were hunkered down for much of the second quarter and i think as the third quarter went on and their own business has started to stabilize and we started to get clarity on the outlook for the rate environment and the difficult operating environment that the industry is going to be faced with for the next two to four years i think that folks started reconnecting if you will so not necessarily what id call ma robust ma conversations but definitely staying in touch with one another and just seeing if as we progress through the tail end of the pandemic and the credit ripple that comes from that and all the challenges theres a lot of banks that i think dont have the scale that they need to drive the value for their shareholders that will be expected and so i think there will be opportunities for ma and i think just from an industrys perspective i really think theres going to be some pentup demand and i think well start to see that play out in the coming year matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 okay thanks for the color clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc you bet operator there are no further questions in the queue at this time do you have any closing remarks clint e stein president chief executive officer and director
