reconciliations provided in our earnings materials i will now hand the call over to columbias president and ceo clint stein clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you jacque good afternoon everyone we made considerable progress over the past three months on the initiatives we discussed in april we enacted changes to the way we evaluate and approve deposit pricing which resulted in increased stabilization in the cost of customer deposits we also achieved more expense reductions during the quarter than what we anticipated and communicated to you in april when we spoke last quarter i outlined the realization of million in annualized net cost reductions from the operational effectiveness work that began during the first quarter this work is the result of identifying opportunities for improvement after observing a year of the combined companys operations these opportunities resulted in a lower head count given the elimination of redundant and overlapping positions and have simplified our organizational structure but our opportunities are not limited to just expense cuts they include revenue generating franchise reinvestment and a cost conscious culture enables us to make reinvestments to support our longterm growth and profitability outlook annualized expense reductions yeartodate from our operational effectiveness work equate to million on a net basis and million on a gross basis we have roughly million of remaining annualized expense reductions slated to be enacted in the third quarter which will get us to our initiative goal of million in net savings and million on a gross basis these savings are in addition to the million net and million gross savings related to last years merger we have achieved million in annualized savings over the past months with million already reinvested into the future growth of our company we have million of the million of cost savings achieved in the first half of earmarked for franchise reinvestment that will occur over the next months or so we didnt execute on nearterm expense initiatives at the detriment of the future growth and competitiveness of our company at the end of the third quarter our gross columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 expense reductions will be million merger to date with the previously mentioned million either already reinvested or allocated for reinvestment resulting in net reductions of million or above our original commitment of million at the announcement of the merger these steps were not taken with the survivors mindset we executed this initiative and will continuously evaluate our expense base so we can thrive well into the future while delivering on our promise of being a high performer our head count reductions were wrapped up during the second quarter the remaining million of planned expense savings will come from other operational sources during the third quarter the savings i outlined are as of quarter end they are not fully reflected in the second quarters normalized operating run rate of roughly million which does not include the previously mentioned expected reinvestments in the coming quarters while we have made substantial progress towards the annualized fourth quarter expense run rate we outlined in our march update we are not adjusting that guide given these planned reinvestments as we wind down the work to right size our expense base our ability to invest in our people our franchise and our suite of products and services remains fully intact we believe these revenuegenerating investments along with the lower expense base will continue to drive additional longterm shareholder value the heavy lifting is behind us and we are very optimistic for the future the franchise we set out to create with the merger in is here we are running it and we are making it resilient to any operating environment our early success on nearterm initiatives has not diminished our laser focus on regaining columbias placement as a top quartile bank as we drive toward longterm consistent repeatable performance i will now turn the call over to ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc all right thank you clint we reported second quarter gaap eps of and operating eps of and our operating return on average tangible equity was while the operating ppnr was million please refer to the nongaap reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to our calculation of operating metrics on the balance sheet we have limited growth and reduced interestbearing cash levels to target approximately billion within deposits we have more of a traditional seasonal decline in noninterest bearing demand related to taxes and corporate distributions our net interest margin increased to in  though it was for the month of june both were within our estimated range of to asset repricing more than offset a basis point increase in interestbearing liability costs our cost of interestbearing deposits was for the quarter and for the month of june the quarter also benefited from higher prepayment speeds which resulted in higher discount accretion for the securities portfolio looking forward we expect purchase accounting income to align more closely to the first quarters level than the second quarters level as detailed towards the end of the earnings release our projected interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position and we expect our rates down deposit betas to approximate those experienced on the way up our provision for credit loss was million for the quarter the portion related to our leasing portfolio declined this quarter to million our overall allowance for credit losses remains robust closing the quarter at of total loans or when including the remaining credit discount total gaap expense for the quarter was million while operating expense was million both down from the first quarter reflecting the efficiency initiative clint discussed earlier columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 and as discussed last quarter weve included the million restructuring charge this quarter in nonoperating expense included in operating expense was a million oneoff nonrecurring credit absent this i peg our normalized level of operating expense at million in  down from the normalized level of million in the first quarter we continue to expect our  operating expense run rate to be in the annualized range of million to million excluding cdi amortization after adjustments our normalized  run rate was at the lower end of that range as clint noted we expect franchise reinvestment to drive the run rate higher partially offset by additional cost savings related to nearterm initiatives ill close with commentary about our regulatory capital position our risk based capital ratios increased as expected in  we expect to build capital above our longterm targets which will provide for enhanced future flexibility and with that ill now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron the stable performance of our loan portfolio underscores the robustness of our throughthe cycle underwriting process and the caliber of our borrowers and sponsors even as we continue the transition to a more typical credit environment after a prolonged period of exceptional quality this quarter we saw to day delinquencies improved to million with the rise in 90plus day delinquencies primarily resulting from the expiration of covidrelated designations within the residential mortgage portfolio nonaccrual loans decreased approximately million mainly due to reduced balances in the finpac portfolio these overall classified loans remain stable our proactive and detailed monitoring of the portfolio complemented by targeted reviews of specific asset categories like multifamily and office properties has revealed no systemic issues across various industries sectors or geographic regions notably there were effectively zero delinquencies in our entire nonowner occupied and multifamily portfolios at the end of the quarter and delinquencies within office properties specifically were remarkably low at roughly basis points of the total office portfolio with no chargeoffs in either category overall net chargeoffs for the company stood at an annualized rate of basis points for the quarter of which the bank contributed basis points and finpac basis points we remain very satisfied with the quality and directionality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio which is highlighted in greater detail in our investor presentation i will now turn the call over to tory torran b nixon presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank targeted actions taken during the first quarter resulted in tighter control and a renewed discipline around deposit pricing changes enacted directly contributed to the stability in our interestbearing core deposit rates in the latter part of the first quarter and through the second quarter as our teams continued to lead with service not price in their customer interactions our branches recently wrapped up a threemonth small business campaign in late april which generated nearly accounts and million in new deposits to the bank importantly of columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 those balances were noninterest bearing and these accounts have collectively increased by roughly million since the campaign ended in april a new campaign was launched in june with over million in new money coming to the bank through midjuly as with the spring campaign the summer campaign includes bundled solutions for customers without promotional pricing or special products the new accounts enhance the granularity of our already diversified deposit base and provide numerous opportunities to deepen relationships over time as businesses grow and we fulfill their needs with additional products and services our cost of interestbearing deposits increased by basis points during the second quarter to compared to a 34basispoint increase during the first quarter highlighting a significantly slower pace of increase following our actions our cost of total deposits was and if we isolate our customer balances of which are noninterest bearing our total cost of customer deposits was in the second quarter our focus on relationship banking continues to benefit our performance in this higher rate environment while recent pricing trends and our successful deposit campaign results are encouraging the second quarter was also impacted by anticipated declines in noninterestbearing deposit balances due to seasonal pressures that include customer tax payments noninterest bearing balances were down on both in an end of period and average basis in the second quarter while pricing pressures have moderated compared to as the fed funds rate has remained constant for the past year persistent inflation continues to draw down customers account balances that said our teams are focused on generating new business to offset this headwind as evidenced by our ongoing campaigns and our proactive activity by our bankers their success will be key to containing our deposit cost regardless of whether we see any rate cuts from the fed this year turning to the loan portfolio relationship driven growth remains our primary focus loan balances increased on an annualized basis in the second quarter after adjusting for a million in targeted loan sales commercial lines of credit and construction draws activity drove the quarters expansion while our loan pipeline remained steady our core fee income pipelines continued to expand we are seeing growth across categories including treasury management commercial card merchant services and international banking to name a few the contribution of these line items to core fee income was up on the quarter and from a year ago we are also seeing tremendous traction with our umpqua smart leads umpqua smart leads use predictive analytics to help our teams capture additional business with our existing customer base through needs based solutions our close rate was up between the first and second quarters while incremental growth in a single product takes time to drive notable bottom line performance we are encouraged by the favorable trends in our collective products and services our bankers remain focused on the activities that drive balance growth in customer deposits core fee income and relationship based loans ill now turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks tory we remain committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive longterm shareholder value in line with our expectations our capital position continues to build as our ratios expand at a total riskbased capital ratio of the parent company is above our longterm target of the bank however remains modestly below at roughly our tce ratio was at quarter end up from at march despite some modest adverse impacts from aoci we continue to target a ratio closer to before considering meaningful options for deploying excess capital the second quarter demonstrates our ability to organically generate capital well above columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 what is required to support prudent growth and our regular dividend providing us longer term flexibility for additional returns to shareholders this concludes our prepared comments chris tory ron frank and i are happy to take your questions now lisa please open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions the first question is coming from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey it looks like a good quarter ron maybe start with you can you maybe help us think through the margin outlook a bit more i see the margin you flagged in june i hear you on a little less accretion but you probably have a rebound in noninterestbearing so help us think through a good starting point or some of the puts and takes that you see on the margin outlook ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah good question and actually really no change from the last quarter its really going to depend on deposit flows do we see that seasonal strength in noninterestbearing in  we will be in the upper end of that range if not well be in the middle or on the lower end but i do want to flag the discount accretion was a bit higher in  i dont expect that to recur unless you saw a meaningful rally in the bond markets so probably somewhere in the middle of the range jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay yeah thats helpful and then just to confirm you guys would welcome a couple of cuts it looks that way in your documents in your comments but youd welcome a couple of cuts in terms of the margin outlook ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah itd be beneficial obviously net interest income we are liability sensitive in our position in the balance sheet that way over the last year so but were positioned for when and if it ever comes columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay okay good and then clint or tory obviously some decent success on the deposit initiatives can you talk about whats really worked well and what youre seeing in terms of overall deposit cost pressures thank you torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc sure jon this is tory i would say i think theres a couple things that work really well and we mentioned in the call and i think chris maybe want to can add in on this i think our small business group within retail the branch system just an outstanding job just being kind of having energy deployed outbound and i think the entire company is doing that i mean its been a yearandahalf as we kind of work through all the process product knowledge infrastructure within the company and just a ton of energy thats being deployed outbound and they had some great results in without pricing without any special pricing or any other gimmicks its really getting out and hitting the street and kind of presenting the value of umpqua bank and what we can do for small businesses and what we can do for commercial customers to just bring their relationships over so added a ton of accounts and a lot of balances on the pricing front i think this has been very constant since we employed some restrictive pricing pressure on our bankers within in the footprint weve seen rates continue to kind of track down a little bit basis points as weve had conversations with customers one by one by one and i think the cost has been i think weve done really nice job kind of keeping the lid on costs and i dont think theres at this point any additional outside pressure from many institutions that would bring that back up so chris i dont know if you have anything else you want to add to that christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah thanks tory hey jon its chris i think that what tory saying there lean into there is our ton of conversations that are going on every single day with our customers about what theyre using the money for how long theyre looking for what the current rate environment is what the competitive environment is and i think part of the competitive environment is definitely calm down which makes those conversations a little bit easier its not as a frantic and its a lot of hard work by our bankers that are out there each and every day doing that and working with customers about directionally where we go if we get a cut our customers i think will be ready because our bankers have been having conversations with them and well see if that happens so yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks guys i appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc welcome operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from matthew clark of piper sandler your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co i guess on deposit cost for my first question it looks like you lowered deposit rates in some of your consumer categories in early july i guess can you speak to kind of retention as youve been doing there and plans to do more or not christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah matt chris thanks for the question we really lowered throughout the last few months july was one piece of it but really started back in the late february indiscernible timeframe retention has been extremely good when you look at ill point to the promotion indiscernible campaign that tory mentioned and all of those balances new accounts that came in theyre actually growing and without extra pricing and then on the cd portion and things of that nature were still maintaining retaining of those balances and so yeah were following that extremely closely and commercial is experiencing the same thing and again we still have flexibility to make exceptions and do things that make sense but its really its really working on that that piece of it well continue to look for opportunities in the competitive market of where our posted rates are and well continue to work the exceptions down as we can and then of course pay attention to where our forward cd pricing is tory i dont know if you want to add anything torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no i think well said matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great and then on your brokered cds and borrowings they were both relatively flat in the quarter could you just speak to whether or not those might start coming down and kind of just trying to get a sense for the pace and magnitude in the overall kind of earning asset level ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey matt this is ron good question you look back at the last couple of quarters weve taken down the level of interestbearing cash at the fed now in this right around the billion and thats really been the collapse as to what we do with the wholesale funds based on other loan and deposit flows so if we see net seasonal growth in deposits second half of the year over and above loans and youll see those wholesale balances drop but the offsets are always going to be targeting right around billion on interestbearing cash at the fed and of those columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 wholesale funds be a brokered deposits or the home loan bank advances theyre structured anywhere from to call it months out so weve got plenty of opportunity to drop it over the course of the year matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then maybe one for frank on chargeoffs i didnt see finpac isolated i know you gave the bank chargeoffs of basis points but and i havent done the math to back into finpac but can you just speak to what the how the finpac net chargeoffs trended in and i think theres an expectation for more relief in the second half but just want to double check there torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah finpac came in at about of the total chargeoffs and theyre right on track to our expectations were definitely seeing improvement through all of the delinquency balance notably to day delinquencies are down over from last quarter nonaccrual balances as a percent of the portfolio are down about and those turn into future chargeoffs and so throughout the rest of the year i think were going to see more significant improvement than weve seen over the course of the last two quarters so things are progressing as planned matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great thanks again clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question will be coming from david feaster of raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc its great to see the significant progress that the team you guys have made on the cost savings from that deep dive and exceeded expectations but you talked about reinvesting some of those savings could you maybe talk about what youre reinvesting in in the road map and time line for some of those initiatives columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah ill start and then im sure that chris and tory might want to add in and clean up the mess i leave on the table here with it but in my prepared comments i talked about the reinvestment thats already occurred and weve spoken over the last couple of years about where weve expanded into new geographies that we tracked that and we didnt thats whats coming off that original million that that we talked about a year ago to get to that net number of the ph million so we still have some things we opened our first branch in the phoenix metro area last month we have the second one opening in scottsdale here in a couple of weeks and we have some other locations where were putting in so we can have full service banking capabilities within those new geographies and tory was reviewing the new markets activity from a commercial perspective with me yesterday and its pretty impressive what the teams have accomplished in all of those markets and so our commitment to them is that if they perform and produce that we will continue to invest in helping them grow those markets and so thats thats what some of that looks like its the other thing is is we continue to attract really really good talent from other organizations and so were seeing opportunities to fill in in certain geographies and strengthen the team weve got some technology platforms that are in flight that are pretty exciting for our teams im not going to mention on the call because i dont want to give our playbook away to any of our competitors that might listen in so its people its facilities its technology its all the things that we think will help us grow revenue over the long haul tory chris anything torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc right i think its well said i mean we i think clint really what he one thing he mentioned i think were really proud of is we had four new commercial offices that we partnered with retail banking weve got branches that are in flight and there in some great markets for us indiscernible team in the bay area and napa valley and arizona colorado and utah and all are well ahead of budget and substantially in the black profitable and really great to see so its it really gives us a ton of confidence that we can continue to hire and attract really talented folks and put them in market and give them the tools to be successful weve got some product and some technology that as you mentioned i think its just going to continue to advance the company and our ability to serve our customers and i think were all really excited about certainly the future of this organization christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc its great christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc and this is chris what ill add is is just i want to kind of emphasize full service while we have very successful commercial teams in those markets that are now give us a flag plant plant the branch in there itll help us columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 grow were not just looking to grow in retail and commercial itll be across wealth it will be mortgage offerings its going to be full service like we do in our other markets itll just look more branch light than it would look in say washington and oregon david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay you guys you also saw the book of transactional resi mortgages in the quarter are there any other transactional books that you may be interested in selling to maybe help optimize the balance sheet further just as the secondary markets pretty open right now frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc the short answer is yes and weve spoken about that weve talked about it i think during some of the conversations that we had in the first quarter about optimizing the balance sheet and where theres some transactional real estate portfolios we need the market we need rates to come down to certain levels before we could execute on that in the meantime were trying to convert them from transactional into full relationships and to the extent theres any success with that then we would just lower the amount that we expect but offhand in terms of anything immediate i dont really see that theres anything weve kind of cleaned up a lot of that stuff over the past year shortly after the merger last year last june july i think it was what ron a little over billion of transactional loans we sold out of the ph market of columbia portfolio and then just as opportunities present itself with some of these resi portfolios weve taken those down as well ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thats correct david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then maybe just thinking about the loan growth side obviously this quarter is some declines in non owner occupied cre growth in construction youve made a bunch of new hires like you talked about where were investing in that side of the business im curious how do you think about the loan pipeline whats the pulse of your markets hows demand looking and where are you seeing growth opportunities torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc this is tory theres a lot of pieces in there ill start with this the pipeline is very consistent to what it was last quarter and i think if you can recall last quarter i talked a little bit about it  pipeline at the end was pretty consistent with  except in terms of total dollars just that there was a shift there was a reduction in the cre pipeline and a likewise like amount increase in the ci pipeline and that has held steady so we continue to see a slight decrease in the cre pipeline and kind of a matching number dollar amount increase in ci so feel good about this continued progress of focused on the ci side and ci front but demand is relatively benign theres just not a ton of demand for lending opportunities anywhere theres some pockets of real optimism we recently did a survey with commercial customers throughout the west and kind of very significant contrast between middle market customers and their optimism versus small business or smaller commercial customers so theres some opportunity in the middle market side but then less on the lowermiddle market and small business in terms of loan demand columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 geographically the west is still strong i mean companies are performing well theyre still just kind of electing to use cash for some investment needs rather than borrow money i mean i feel good about it teams are deployed were really focused on full relationship banking if were going to make loans to people we want their deposits and we want the opportunity to provide services to create fee income for the bank so i feel good i really feel were probably a lowsingle digit loan growth number through the balance of the year but i think were poised to when the opportunity exists for us in terms of more demand well be ready to go and get out there make sure that were providing great service for our customers and bring in new names to the bank david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats helpful within ci are you seeing a more opportunity with deepening relationships at existing customers or are these new relationships that youre bringing to the bank torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc i would say both theres a major emphasis on expanding relationships that we already have so new products new services a lot of fee income business i talked about the fee income pipeline i mean if i look at treasury management commercial card merchant services international banking i mean those four solutions right there are big for us were seeing a lot of activity weve had a lot of growth in that part of the fee income pipeline and in just production itself so feel really good there new names are a tougher road but weve had some really good success in some of our de novo markets but were also having success everywhere and the whole idea here is that were going to focus on our customers we are going to serve them really well provide products and services for the needs that they have and then theres an outbound effort to make sure we can bring in new names to the company david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific extremely helpful thank you all clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from brandon king of truist your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so in regards to credit quality and your targeted reviews could you just elaborate further on amount of the loan portfolio that you reviewed i know you mentioned zero delinquencies but any other surprises any other takeaways that would be great to hear clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc no no no surprises brandon i mean i think everything is is is moving how we kind of expected the higher rate environment the high duration for longer you see the impact and some of the smaller customers indiscernible delinquencies are ticking up and our sba loan portfolio continues to experience higher delinquencies and higher higher chargeoffs than we typically would see within the portfolio but most of those carry some sort of a government guarantee that so thats thats a thats a form of mitigant for us but the biggest kind of success that that i that i would point to at least for me is is just our commercial real estate portfolio was just and just performing absolutely fantastic the the teams are are laser focused i would say first on on portfolio management and staying ahead of of any potential repricing and maturities and second is is kind of going out there and looking for additional business and so and so as we see these repricing opportunities on the horizon they are already identified they are not surprised by them if it looks tight we are the first ones out talking to them and we address it ahead of time as opposed to being proactive we are proactive as opposed to being reactive excuse me brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and in the reviews did you include any reappraisals or updated ltvs or is it mainly just kind of looking at what it was clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc we we yeah we we would not reappraise unless there is a an event an event of maturity or or a a downgrade into more of a classification type status but what we do do is is we look at current rent rolls and we kind of extrapolate from that a form of evaluation and we update the value internally if you will for that evaluation so so we feel we feel good about the position of the portfolio and the numbers that we throw out there in the investor presentation they are they are as current as we can make them and as accurate as we can make them based upon the information that we have we have seen some seen some decreases obviously in value but we have always employed a leverage averse kind of posture to underwriting and so so we we feel really good about the portfolio and the loan to values in the event that we have to restructure some of these things as we move forward which we dont see presently so brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay very very helpful and lastly for me just on fee income particularly core fee income there was some some good strength there could you just speak to the momentum in those line items and kind of whats your outlook over the back half of the year and beyond torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 sure hey brandon this is tory so that those four big categories that i talk about treasury management commercial card merchant services and international banking collectively they are about they are up about quarteroverquarter and then yearoveryear they are up about the two biggest movers are in terms of percentage of commercial card and international banking and i would categorize it this way that the fee income pipeline continues to grow every single day i think i mentioned umpqua smart leads this ability to kind of look at predictive analytics and help our bankers see a product or service that can provide a solution for a customer and gives them kind of a warm lead we have had a lot of success in leveraging that and going out to our customer base and kind of walking them through what certain products and services will do to support their business and to help them become more efficient more cost effective in the pipeline its its its very well received by the bankers and even its even better than that its really well received by the customer base and they see it as a real positive and a real very helpful for them so its pretty easy sale and so i am seeing a lot of a lot of growth there pipeline is strong very optimistic about that i mean there is no reason why this cant just continue on with these kind of growth numbers because the activity just keeps picking up and eventually just kind of it hits to the bottom line and its just reoccurring every single day christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey brandon this is chris i will add from the kind of the other side of the business that we talked about the the campaign in the in the spring we are seeing increased in merchant referrals that are now starting to book and so merchant card revenues are up and thats a real positive sign and then the other one would be its in our wealth management division our trust company is doing extremely well we built a lot of connections with our the new bankers and others in there and we are getting a lot more referrals internally into that space so its good quality growth there assets under management are up considerably this year from new business being driven in and then in our wealth advisor group we talked in the back in the fourth quarter that we pivoted our platform over to raymond james and that transition went through into the second quarter its now officially i would declare it behind us and those groups are now starting to see the what we had we planned for was with a platform that had better technology and an end user experience we expected to see revenue increasing in that space and thats exactly what we are starting to see and would expect that to continue throughout this year brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thanks really appreciate the detailed response operator thank you operator instructions one moment for the next question and our next question is going to come from jared shaw of barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 hey maybe just could you go back to the the growth in residential nonperformers i think you referenced that coming off of covid protections what is that just loans that were delinquent that are now switching to non performing is that require a provision associated with that or is that separate frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc hey jared this is frank yes thats exactly what they were they were there were loans that that that started to struggle sometime during covid and we we employed modifications deferrals to them our accounting group subsequently removed the flag for those for those loans and and thats what you see in the 90plus category today ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc and jared this is ron no meaningful provision on that a good chunk of that also is government guaranteed jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay and then looking at mortgage banking any sort of update on on what you expect for that going going forward i guess maybe second quarter you got a little benefit seasonally but how you are seeing the outlook there christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah jared this is chris i think its really settled into a really nice spot since the transition of it its very consistent month in month out we are seeing most of the volume obviously is being driven by purchases at around to there is still refi activity in there that comes in around each and every month and and there is a little bit of construction lines to perm that make up the remainder of it most of it is we had discussed about the strategy and where we are going is more of a bank and mortgage company within the bank actually we are a indiscernible of the bank is the mortgage company of the production is saleable product with the remaining part going into the portfolio so yeah no its settled down i think the teams have done a really nice job we are seeing good internal referral activities i couldnt be happier with it jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then just finally for me the million incentive comp reversal that you referenced i guess what were the what were the triggers that that caused that to be reversed clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah its its part of its part of the analysis that we did in terms of of overall as part of the expense initiative and looking at some of our our compensation programs and being able to correlate those to driving shareholder value versus utilizing those as part of reinvesting and growing revenue streams in the future so so we had we had an accrual out there when we terminated or altered the programs then we just didnt didnt have a need for the accrual so we had to reverse it columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay so should we should we think that a core run rate on salaries and benefits this quarter would be closer to that ph to level ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jared this is ron with that million maybe correct but more importantly ph million would be a normalized level expense for  excluding that because that wont be recurring jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay ph million for the overall expenses got it okay thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc for the second quarter on a normalized basis right jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc eventually we are going to get into our indiscernible bottom end of our million to million annualized range that we expect for  less cdi amortization so the driver there being the reinvestments indiscernible mentioned earlier jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon wanted to talk about another question on the mortgage side i thought at one point there was an effort to maybe look at minimizing the volatility within that line item in the fee income side and i cant remember if that was a legacy umpqua thing or maybe shrinking the msr portfolio is there any thought or effort to minimize that ahead or was that something that was in the past sorry thats ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 hey jeff this is ron good question and yeah very much that was umpqua historically and we have reduced volatility within mortgagerelated fair value changes for example prior to prior to the run up in rates we didnt have a hedge on the msr all right so we benefited from that on the way up and we now got a hedge on the msr so that will help protect no matter which way rates go in the future on that front so all of the nice words are just reducing reducing volatility in many ways in many cases its fair value volatility just given which way rates move no plans at this point to significantly reduce the level of msr i think you are going to see a pretty steady state and again we have got that hedge for any potential future rates down environment clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah just just to add to that i mean i think beyond just volatility in the mortgage area really any any part of our operation thats thats thats volatile i mean seasonality is one thing business cycles are another thing but if its truly just something thats volatile and creates noise we are going to take a hard look at those things and and anything that that has a negative implication on our ability to just be consistent quarterafterquarter is going to get get a lot of scrutiny jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got you thanks and clint you kind of teased this a little bit taking a look at some of your newer production in the denver phoenix salt lake city is there have you guys put a dollar figure to that in terms of like yearto date production that comes from i just i have a vague idea of of what those newer locations you have talked about reaching breakeven but wanted to get a sense for what is the loan production out of out of those relative to the total company clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i mean they they have done a tremendous job and i would say if they are listening to the call they will be disappointed if i dont if i dont clarify that they are they are beyond breakeven if possible torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah exactly clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc and i dont know that we have disclosed anywhere in terms of specific for by by geography we thats a slippery slope because then we we start thinking about all the other elements of our footprint but so i dont i dont know if we really can give you any any additional context unless tory has something torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no i would no i would just i would just say that other than just balances its with a few people so the expense base is pretty low but they are very very talented hard working folks and they they have been able to bring new names into the company they have got a lot they have got strong noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits they have got good strong almost solely ci loan balances and really good fee income so they are kind of carrying the flag of the bank in a great way on relationship banking in all of those new columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 markets and starting from basically scratch and very very proud of the efforts that they have put in and the success that they have had and its meaningful numbers i mean relative to the rest of the company its a smaller number but its a meaningful number and to build the ability and to be able to go in and start from a dead stop and have success so quickly and to be profitable so quickly is is a great thing jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got you lastly clint and i imagine if you if you look at open bank ma if thats even an option but you are might be prioritize team lift outs or anything from a from an acquisition standpoint is that anything you are looking at clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah our our top priority is in my prepared remarks i said the company that we set out to create when we announced the merger in we are running it today so our top priority is is to get the most out of this company and hopefully these last two quarters and the efforts that you have seen with the execution of of the expense initiative the momentum that chris and tory have talked about on the business side that we are starting to prove that out so i think we still have some work to do but we live it every day so we know that the strength of this company and the quality of the people that we have that are out there every day taking care of our customers so thats thats our top priority i i mentioned earlier that we are still attracting talent and whether its a team without tory mentioned the indiscernible team that is one of the new groups that we started in the past nine months or so if you think about that we probably interviewed 50plus people or looked at 50plus people from that organization and took about it was so so just because somebody is out there doesnt mean that they are going to meet meet our criteria how they go to market how they drive value but we do we are always looking at any opportunity thats there i would say the lowest priority right now would be open bank ma yeah i dont know whats going to happen with the election and that process and we are just now getting the scar tissue healed up from from the hell that we were put through in so never say never but i just i dont think now is the time for that we have got other priorities that are more pressing and i think will drive drive more shareholder value over the long run jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you operator thank you and one moment for our next question our next question will be coming excuse me our next question will be coming from chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks ron just a quick one on the fourth quarter expense range the annualized million to million balancing what you did this quarter in the investments is there any reason for us as analyst to lean on either side of the midpoint ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i think at this point looking into  midpoint probably makes more sense columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats all i
