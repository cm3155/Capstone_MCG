to focus on growing our business stand up new lending programs as part of the cares act and pledge million to support communities through our pass it on and covid19 community relief campaigns coviddriven changes to our operating model have resulted in minimal disruption and id like to recognize that this is in large part due to the expertise and tenacity of our business continuity and crisis management teams the individual that leads this team is military trained and has over years of corporate business continuity columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 experience her guidance and leadership in executing on our pandemic plan has allowed the entire executive team to remain outwardly focused on managing and growing the bank the pandemic and resulting economic turmoil has magnified the focus on credit within our industry at columbia we have always taken an active approach in assisting clients through full economic cycles while the pandemic is beyond typical weve experienced thinkers with thorough knowledge of our clients businesses we believe this gives us a competitive advantage over most community banks the strength of our capital position provides us the flexibility to help our clients and communities recover from the economic effects of the pandemic like most things we are managing a surplus of liquidity and while this has negatively affected our net interest margin net interest income is relatively stable even in light of the feds march rate cuts on the call with me today are aaron deer our chief financial officer chris merrywell our chief operating officer and andrew mcdonald our chief credit officer following our prepared remarks well be happy to answer your questions let me remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to our earnings release our website or our sec filings at this point ill turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you clint second quarters earnings of million and eps of were an increase of million and respectively on a linked quarter basis after factoring out the significant provision expense of million quarterly pretax preprovision earnings of million were our best quarter on record which was million higher than the prior record set in the second quarter of and up million on a linked quarter basis the increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale portion of our visa class b restricted stock and subsequent writeoff of the remaining shares which together contributed million to pretax income we also recognized an gain on the sale of a loan that had been previously charged off net interest income for the second quarter was million a decrease of on a linked quarter basis the drop was due to the early payoff of three investment securities in the first quarter which added million of nonrecurring income to that earlier period meanwhile second quarter interest income was negatively affected by the full quarter impact of the march federal reserve rate cuts which were largely offset by interest earned on ppp loans interest expense declined significantly during the period as shortterm borrowings were replaced with lower cost deposit funding the net interest margin of represented a drop of basis points on a linked quarter basis excess liquidity from record deposit inflows as well as lower yields on loans and investment securities caused by the rate environment contributed basis points and basis points of the decrease respectively the addition of lower yielding ppp loans dropped it by basis points and the margin dropped by basis points due to onetime prepayment fees in the first quarter combined with increased premium amortization in the second quarter on investment securities the remaining basis point decline was due to balance sheet mix our cost of deposits continue to be industry leading at basis points which was down basis points on a linked quarter basis and basis points compared to the second quarter of total deposits ended the quarter at billion up billion during the quarter approximately of this increase was concentrated in non interestbearing demand deposits which rose by billion or at june our loans totaled billion columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 with ppp loans accounting for about of that our loantodeposit ratio was at quarter end chris will give more color on the drivers behind those balance sheet trends in a moment given the very strong deposit inflows and excess liquidity we are starting to deploy more of the funds that we expect much of the ppp money to be depleted over the coming months and could see other outflows as well so were taking a very cautious and incremental approach for new investments noninterest income of million was an increase of million from the prior quarter due to the aforementioned million gain on visa stock and gain on the loan sale this was offset by a reduction in overdraft fees of million the decrease in overdraft fees is attributed to higher deposit balances as well as lower transaction volumes due to the shelterinplace orders noninterest expense was million in the second quarter which was a decrease of million on a linked quarter basis the change was principally due to an million reduction in compensation and employee benefit costs stemming mostly from the capitalization of loan origination costs from the ppp loan program this was partly offset by million of systems legal and professional and various other costs much of which were incurred to respond to the pandemic and set up the ppp program in addition the provision for unfunded loan commitments included in other noninterest expense increased by million our noninterest expense ratio fell to for the quarter while our operating efficiency ratio dropped to we expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to return to the mid for the balance of the year our effective tax rate for the quarter was which compares to on a linked quarter basis and for the second quarter of and with that ill turn the call over to chris chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone it is understood that the economic challenges faced this quarter have been extraordinary our bankers have responded with hundreds from all divisions and regions rallying to ensure our clients obtain ppp funding while at the same time attending to loan deferral requests and the growing of nonppp loans and our deposit portfolio our bankers are dedicated to their clients success and their efforts have resulted in the balance sheet growth that you have seen as clint mentioned the work of our crisis management team provided us a layered approach to covid and allowed us to keep all of our branches and facilities open during the quarter to service our clients needs with minimal disruption additionally in the second quarter we saw unprecedented loan and deposit growth as an outcome of the federal economic stimulus response to the pandemic as aaron mentioned deposits grew by billion the growth was largely due to the lower spending resulting from shelterinplace orders as well as proceeds from the ppp loan program the deposit mix shifted slightly from business and consumer at march to business and consumer at quarters end the exceptional build in deposits balances flowed to the asset side of the balance sheet as well loans rose by million during the quarter to billion as was mentioned and absent ppp loans our portfolio declined by million ci loans declined by million but were offset by increases in agriculture and ph cre eloans of million and million respectively our utilization rate has declined from at the end of the first quarter to at the end of june this contributed to million of columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 loan paydowns during the quarter as we saw our clients use other available excess funds to pay down debt and our utilization rates declines were seen across all loan categories total production was billion for the quarter with ppp loans contributing million setting aside the ppp portfolio loan production was lower than normal but given the environment during the second quarter our bankers still found opportunities to take care of our clients needs and produce an additional million construction in onetofour family real estate was up compared to first quarter or as modest production declines were seen in cre ci and our agricultural portfolios as aaron previously mentioned our cost of deposits declined to just basis points in the second quarter compared to basis points in the first quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of our response to the fed interest rate drop in march we continue to believe that our relationshipbased approach is a key differentiator and our clients rely on this as much as on any deposit interest rate available in the market excluding the ppp loans the quarter production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio mix is now ppp loans nonppp fixed floating which is prime and libor and variable excluding the ppp program new loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which is lower than the overall portfolio rate of as of quarter end also excluding the ppp loans the overall portfolio rate declined basis points during the quarter with construction down basis points and ci down basis points the lower rate environment has increased demand in the mortgage space we are very pleased with the progress of our residential lending business and its impact to noninterest income we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our mortgage solutions in both the purchase and the refinance markets in the future and now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you the provision under cecl of million reflects our economic forecast which continues to be negatively impacted from the covid19 pandemic as a reminder we use ihs markit for our economic forecast in general our forecast anticipates an annualized gross domestic product in the third quarter of followed by performance in the fourth quarter with the economy continuing to recover next year unemployment will remain elevated ending the year around and ending at about thus the economic forecast accounted for about million of our provision for the quarter and negative migration accounted for the rest we ended the quarter with a provision relative to periodend loans of adjusting for the ppp loans the allowance to periodend loans increases to in contrasting the first quarter provision relative to the second quarter provision the second quarter scenario is much steeper of an economic impact than anticipated in the first quarter with a solid recovery in the latter half of this year certainly the economy has improved and statistics recently bear that out however the momentum and path of the recovery is a lot more questionable given recent coronavirus cases and states halting or rolling back opening adding to this uncertainty theres the consumer reaction to the recent spike of coronavirus cases and what will future government stimulus look like therefore our modeling now reflects a more protracted recovery with slower gdp growth and an unemployment rate that remains elevated npas for the quarter were relatively unchanged at basis points however i feel adjusting for ppp loans provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward into with this adjustment npas do increase columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 but only by basis points so again relatively unchanged i would like to remind folks npas are still comprised of credits whose issues predate the pandemic past due loans for the quarter were basis points and net chargeoffs annualized were basis points for the quarter our impaired capital ratio rose modestly from to therefore your standard credit metrics for the quarter were very acceptable overall when compared to the first quarter it was a relatively stable quarter on the risk rating front loans rated watch or below increased approximately million during the quarter we saw watch loans increase million going from million to million special mention loans increased million to million and substandard loans saw an increase of million and are now around million in total these changes increased our watch and below risk rating from to of total loans the sector which saw the greatest migration was hospitality as it accounted for about of the negative migration the balance was centered in other commercial real estate however over a broad range of categories on the deferral front i want to remind folks that most of our deferral programs were for four months so the vast majority will begin making payments in august we granted over requests for payment deferrals amounting to about billion in total loans through june as i noted last quarter we believe these deferrals are in the best interest of all of our stakeholders as we try to work our way through this pandemic most of the deferrals little over or roughly million were granted to clients in our dental portfolio another million in loan deferrals were granted in hospitality followed by office of million healthcare nondental million retail million and restaurant at around million in total the categories i just reviewed account for approximately of our deferrals with that i would now like to give you some color on the portfolios we believe to be some of the first impacted by the pandemic for columbia that includes hotels retail restaurants aviation and of course our dental and healthcare portfolio in aggregate these industries account for about billion in loans or roughly of our loan portfolio the largest portfolio impacted by the covid19 pandemic is our dental portfolio i am sure most of you are aware most states had directed dental practices to cease operation with the exception of emergency types of procedures last march and april so effectively most dental offices were closed until the end of may when we last spoke about of our portfolio was in states that had yet allowed dental practices to be opened today of the states where we have exposure have allowed dental offices to open with appropriate covid protocols in place as of june we had million in dentalrelated loans representing approximately loans for an average loan size of therefore it was a very granular portfolio within this number is approximately ppp loans for a gross balance of million so the growth in this portfolio was isolated to ppp loans again we believe the impact on this portfolio is truly transitory today most of these practices are generating revenue at around of prepandemic level at this level of revenue generation we believe most of these practices are operating above breakeven the combination of deferrals and ppp loans are allowing these practices to move forward with little impact on the banks balance sheet today weve had very little requests for additional relief within the dental portfolio and continue to report as pass rated excluding the dental portfolio we have another billion or of our portfolio to discuss columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 the next largest segment which we have identified as having high risk relative to the economic disruption caused by covid19 is our retail portfolio we have approximately million in retailrelated exposure split between commercial real estate and commercial business loans this represents about of our loan portfolio again growth in this portfolio was driven by ppp loans we granted ppp loans for a cumulative total of million to our retail customers the largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of commercial real estate loans with approximately million in balances it is evenly split between washington and oregon and as you would expect centered within the portland and seattle msas the average loan size is again we provide retail loans primarily to standalone retail centers like auto parts stores building materials and garden stores along with food and beverage and gas stations in addition the portfolio contains groceryanchored centers and mixed use properties mostly strip centers we are not in large downtown core metropolitan areas nor do we finance regional malls using at origination values the average loan to value for the portfolio was with of the portfolio having a loan to value less than we have stress tested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen in the great recession the average loan to value rises to with about of the properties having a loan to value less than for the entire retail portfolio is pass rated is watch is special mention and substandard the breakdown is essentially unchanged from the first quarter we did see an uptick in deferral requests in this portfolio during the second quarter and have granted about million in loan deferrals or roughly of the retail portfolio most of this activity occurred early in the quarter and the pace of new deferrals has declined greatly which is consistent across the entire portfolio let me give you a little more color around deferrals for the entire portfolio during the month of april we granted billion in deferrals therefore we are averaging about million a week during the month of june we granted million in deferral for an average weekly volume of million so far through the first two weeks of july the weekly volume has declined to million so the demand for deferrals has declined okay lets discuss hotels next we have million in hotel loans representing about of our loan portfolio about is in major markets which would include the portland and seattle msas however we also have about of the hotel portfolio or million of exposure out on the oregon coast to give you an idea of the types of hotels we finance most have one of the following flags holiday inn best western choice marriott and wyndham in total flag properties comprise of the portfolio the average loan size is million today we have granted deferral requests for about million or half of the portfolio we anticipate the recovery in the hotel sector to be prolonged i would expect many of these clients will seek additional support throughout and into with this in mind were working on a number of options for our clients which include usda program the main street lending program along with more conventional solutions as well similar to the retail commercial real estate loans we continue to do stress testing on this portfolio as well the average loan to value for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is with of the portfolio having a loan to value less than on a stress basis about of the portfolio has a loan to value less than nondental healthcare is about million in total this was another area where we saw a fair number of ppp applications we extended ppp loans for around million in this segment ppp loan activity was thus responsible for growth in this portfolio approximately million of the portfolio is veterinary another million are physician practices of varying kinds and million is other types of healthcare providers such as chiropractors physical therapists and counseling services the average loan size is as of june of the portfolio is pass rated with on watch and rated substandard we have granted deferral columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 requests for about million in total in this segment or roughly of the portfolio similar to the dental space we see this sector rebounding as folks are once again able to see their orthopedists dermatologists or optometrists in addition elective surgeries such as hip replacements knee replacements corneas cataract and cosmetic surgeries are now being performed okay restaurants and food services we have approximately million in this portfolio with twothirds being commercial real estate loans the average loan size is today is pass rated is watch special mention and the balance is substandard we have granted deferrals for about million in this portfolio the portfolio did see negative migration during the quarter primarily out of the pass and watch categories to special mention and substandard similar to the hotel and retail segments we see this area taking some time to heal we do stress testing on the cre portion of this portfolio and on a prepandemic basis the average loan to value was with having a loan to value less than again on a prepandemic basis under a stress test scenario loan to value rises to with only having a loan to value less than the last portfolio im going to discuss is our aviation portfolio it is comprised of both direct exposure to domestic airline carriers as well as entities that lease airplanes and engines to airline carriers in total the portfolio is about million with about million being direct exposure to us domestic airlines and the remaining million in exposure to lessors of the airplanes today most of the portfolio is rated special mention with the exception of one credit rated watch and one rated substandard of the domestic airlines we have exposure to they have raised over billion in additional capital to assist them through this pandemic including carriers we do not have exposure to the amount of capital raised today exceeds billion as such this additional capital combined with the expense reduction efforts results in all of our borrowers having over months of burn rate now in addition these domestic airline carriers are continuing to negotiate agreements amounting to billions of additional funding with the us treasury via the cares act within our portfolio our customers have executed a little over billion in signed letters of intent and industrywide approximately billion in letters of intent have been executed while no final agreements have been executed and no timeline for funding has been provided we know if needed additional capital is available we believe this government funding will help them recover from the covid19 impacts along with the billions of dollars of capital already raised most of our domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft with a prestressed loan to value of and a current loan to value we believe closer to as for the leasing portfolio of the exposure is in asia europe and north america the rest is in south america and the middle east the majority of the portfolio consists of narrowbody aircraft with an average age of years for the entire portfolio the average age is years with widebody the lowest at years we view the younger more fuelefficient aircraft as being the most in demand post pandemic based on origination values our average loan to value for the portfolio is however based on what we believe is todays values the loan to value is closer to okay ill now turn the call over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 thank you andy as i stated on our first quarter earnings call columbia bank is actively meeting the challenges of the disruptions caused by covid19 the strength of our balance sheet credit profile that andy just reviewed liquidity and capital position are serving us well and we continue to expand our reach recent examples of the ongoing reinvestment in our business are the deployment of zelle earlier this month and the construction of our boise neighborhub which is scheduled to open later this quarter sending a clear message on our longterm commitment to the treasure valley we continue to receive recognition for the work we do on your behalf and are honored to recently have been selected by forbes as the best bank in both washington and oregon these awards are a direct result of the tremendous work done each day by our bankers recent external events have underscored the importance of a companys values and culture diversity and open discussion is core to columbia banks culture and during this turbulent time we continue to engage with our employees in communities through active dialogue and outreach this morning we announced our quarterly dividend of this quarters dividend payout of of earnings will be paid on august to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august this concludes our prepared comments and now myra we will open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time we would like to take any questions you might have for us today operator instruction we have our first question over the phone line from ph luke wilson your line is open please go ahead q hey good morning guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning q i was wondering andy do you mind rattling off the special mention and substandard portfolios again for the quarter i missed just i think those two numbers andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah thats not a problem i can do that so our special mention loans are now million and our substandard loans are million columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 q perfect thanks and then i wanted to talk a little bit about the geography of the reserve build last quarter we saw that the majority of the increase was related to the commercial portfolio was it similar this quarter and do you have the commercial and consumer reserve to loans ratio excluding ppp on hand andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc well our reserve isnt as complicated as some of the larger banks so i know we allocate it but i dont have those numbers with me indiscernible so q thats okay yes okay then just kind of talking about the if you look at i think its on slide that shows the macro factors again kind of weighing on the majority of the reserve build looking forward i mean given the kind of visibility that we have now versus kind of at quarter end do you see that the majority of the reserve build should kind of continue to be impacted by that or should it be probably more geared towards portfolio migration going forward andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc well first of all our consumer book is really small and its performing fine so its really not drawing much in reserves in terms of looking forward with cecl its all about your economic forecast if you look at our first quarter where we had over million in loans downgraded over of the reserve build was due to the economic forecast so even in a quarter where you doubled the size of your if you will problem loans it has a muted impact from a reserve build standpoint so the real i think wildcard continues to be the economic forecast and of course i said it in my speech all the recent economic data was pretty good although today unemployment came out at million unemployment claims so i think the real question is whats going to happen to the consumer as we enter into the latter half of the third quarter with rising cases if you look at california and texas some of those states theyve rolled back much more significantly than others states like idaho which we are in historically have not been impacted and now you have the governor trying to get people to wear masks so if that puts the consumer back on the sideline then the economic forecast of the third quarter will continue to be poor and will thus continue to drive more provisioning if the consumer doesnt get frightened by that and the case counts improve and we dont end up going backwards then i think migration will have a larger percentage than what it has today but it will still the majority will still be driven by the economic forecast does that help you at all q yes no that was very helpful thanks and then just lastly and maybe this is for clint just kind of on the ppp loans do you mind just giving us the kind of schedule that you guys are modeling for forgiveness and then what percentage of the overall portfolio you expect to be forgiven columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc i think thats still a bit of a moving target relative to what the entire process looks like and if congress passes expedited relief for the smaller ones i know theres a bill circulating in the senate right now that further modifies the forgiveness process but im going to defer to chris hes been very close to in terms of our internal focus on the forgiveness process and what that might look like chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thanks clint yeah the process continues to evolve and were obviously very hopeful im sure that others have an expedited process and if you use an amount of about that would be somewhere in excess of of our requests that have an expedited forgiveness process the rest kind of remains to be seen as the timing were crossing our fingers and hopeful our clients are anxious to start that process and be able to move forward as well but were really waiting for the guidance to come out of when we can actually submit were ready to go indiscernible were anxious our clients are anxious but time is to be determined as far as the amount of overall forgiveness i think thats going to be anybodys best guess i think when we first started having an eightweek timeframe in which to deploy the funds and some of the other restrictions that were on it i think it was a lower number i think extending through the end of the year allowing the numbers to change from payroll to other types of items as well puts in a position where a majority and id say a high majority is likely to be forgiven i think the program has set itself up to if a recipient spends the money correctly then youll have an extremely high forgiveness rate but theres also the opportunities where some folks may indeed go out of business or something so i cant really give you a clear number but im looking at it as theres a very high percentage that will be actually forgiven from when they come out and it will trickle through the end of the year q okay thats helpful off the back thank you guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc sure operator we have our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom your line is open please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning jon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc indiscernible start with the margin indiscernible clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc you broke up there jon but i think you want to talk about the margin indiscernible clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc jon were not picking you up im not sure if youre able to get a little closer to a cell signal if thats whats going on or try in another line jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay i can dial back in ill dial back in operator we have another question from the line of levi posen your line is open please go ahead levi posen q analyst d a davidson co hi good morning this is levi posen on for jeff rulis clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning levi levi posen q analyst d a davidson co good morning i saw related to ppp that you guys broke out the benefit to interest income and you mentioned that a majority of the decline in comp was related to the deferred expense there i was wondering is there a number for the deferred expense that was recognized this quarter aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i guess to maybe give some more color generally within the expense categories maybe just break out kind of five different items that i think will help you arrive at what might be considered a core rate within the comp and benefits line theres about million and that was the vast majority of which were those ppp origination cost so that is ph impact in the we also had a credit with our regulatory premiums that was about columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 in the quarter we had some outsized data processing costs of about million we had legal and professional costs that were outsized by about million and then in the other line we had expenses there that were about million outsized and that was largely the provision for unfunded commitments so if you add up each of those items you come up with about million in total kind of what i would consider to be outsized or abnormal items and which is pretty close to the million that weve talked about being a run rate levi posen q analyst d a davidson co okay thats helpful thank you for the color there moving over to the credit side appreciate the detail that was broke out there but in the credits that were moved to npa i think it was a cre line of credit any more color on those relationships aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you mean the movement in the cre npas levi posen q analyst d a davidson co yeah aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc no not really they just represent commercial real estate projects that were struggling prepandemic theres a couple of them that are in there weve been working with these folks for a while theyre just kind of running out of steam and so we placed them on nonaccrual well have to see where that goes one well probably take a longer term work out the other one i anticipate one of the sponsors will probably dilute the other guys out so that would be just fine with us levi posen q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you thats it for me ill step back operator operator instructions we have our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom your line is open please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right does it sound better clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc much better jon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right im standing on the roof of my house hopefully this works so aaron a quick question for you im sure you had an interesting quarter first one in the chair but just lets get right to the margin in terms of you talked about liquidity and loan pricing and prepayment fees all of those are headwinds and i guess we understand that but how do you want us to think about the margin from here and do those categories all kind of maybe through payment fees dont but the other categories kind of persist and cause some pressure in  aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah thats exactly right and then i gave kind of a breakdown of those different drivers and we also have that within the investor presentation that we posted to the website at the bottom of page and so it kind of shows the shift from first quarter to second quarter and what drove that basis point decline excess liquidity was clearly a big part of that as i mentioned were going to try to get more of that deployed but were going to do so pretty conservatively as we try to ascertain what kind of what the depositor behavior is with all the new inflows that came onto the balance sheet so hopefully as we get some of that deployed that will help recover some of the pressure but fundamentally the low rate environment is the real challenge here and as an asset sensitive institution theres not a great deal that we can do given where our funding costs already are so if you look at where our yields went quartertoquarter you can see that it came down quite a bit on the loan book as well as the investment securities our new purchases on investment securities during the quarter were right around ph so that book is going to continue to be under pressure similarly on the loan side as chris mentioned the new loans in the quarter came on at again well below what the average is for the book now that arguably might be a little low just because of the mix of the types of credits we put on during the quarter so hopefully that will come up but if thats where new asset yields are coming on the balance sheet obviously were facing a pretty strong headwind on that front so well try to make up some of that in terms of how were pricing products and getting more of this liquidity deployed but i think the margin is going to be the core margin i should say is going to be real challenged obviously on the ppp loans that too has added a little bit of pressure on it excluding the rate of forgiveness on that that could continue to cause a little pressure too given the low yields on that category but i would expect that if the forgiveness comes in i think as a lot of people expect over the next couple of quarters the acceleration of the fees related to that will at least give a noncore bounce to the margin so well its kind of wait and see how that plays out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay i know its hard to project but that helps andy a question for you it was great detail on what youve considered maybe stressed or atrisk categories but is it safe to assume that those that are not on deferral would be credits that you consider healthy or they have the resources to stick around and pay their loans is that a fair assessment columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah i dont think that thats at all a bad characterization and there are a lot of businesses that i even within our hotel segment not every hotel is doing poorly we have some properties that have really benefited in a strange way because of covid and other types of facilities have closed down and so for construction workers for example the extended stay folks are doing quite well in a lot of the rural markets to achieve social distancing and then also to provide a place in case a coworker in a processing plant or a manufacturing plant gets tested a lot of businesses are renting hotel rooms to have those places where those individuals can go for days and get quarantined before they go back to work so there are a lot of things like that and so yes i would agree with your characterization jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then last one kind of a random question but maybe its for chris or clint but curious if theres a way to characterize how your people are spending their time today versus how they were spending their time say back in january february im assuming it was all hands on deck with ppp but im just curious to kind of gauge a sense of normalcy what are your people doing today versus what they were doing prepandemic if that makes sense clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yeah ill start and then ill let chris finish as we got past the grind of the ppp origination process and into the month of may we really started focusing on whats the new normal at least for this interim period and i think that the work that we did then has actually set us up for what how things have played out since then as we look at even things like schools across the country going virtual the impact that has on families the capabilities that we have for folks who can work remotely but also the need for continuing to stay connected to the organization and rotate them into the offices in a safe socially distanced manner what weve seen id say over the last two months and this is even true for the executive team as weve started resuming some of what we would consider normal types of activities traveling throughout the footprint spending time in market with our bankers doing some client calls its very different some of those client calls now by our bankers are being done via things like microsoft teams or zoom but some are also occurring in person and i think thats something that our bankers have embraced is getting back to what feels normal to them and the ability to not only take care of their existing client base but also continue to develop their prospects and win new business and weve had some examples in the last or days of significant wins on the new business front and so its not business as usual because i think as a society right now nothing is normal but it certainly is a sustainable way for us to continue to grow our franchise and thats what i was getting at in my prepared remarks and i believe the term i used was we continue to expand our reach and i referenced the rollout of zelle so were still focused on digital is more important than ever and the work weve done in the last several years is certainly paying big dividends now but also were looking at markets that were very bullish on and expanding our physical presence like what were doing in downtown boise so i think that all of those types of activities give our bankers a sense of normalcy and ill turn it over to chris to fill in any gaps that i might have missed chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 thanks clint jon i think the parts that i can fill in on is with a return to a little bit of normalcy i mean our as i mentioned our facilities our branches our lobbies were open majority of the time during the last quarter and what weve seen is people moving more to utilizing drivethroughs utilizing mobile deposit options and so we spent some time working on scripting and outreach to our clients since theyre not coming in quite in the same amounts to proactively start talking to them about the things like zelle pretty extensive project that went into that and promoting that so that we can see that adoption rate move and increase id say also folks have looked at the opportunities of while they may not be able to travel where they wanted to they may not be able to go on a european vacation weve encouraged our folks to find time to get away from the office and just try and decompress because it really has been all hands on deck and quite a sprint for the six months of the first half of the year and so encouraging to do that knowing that the second half were going to be faced with some and our employees will with school closures and what that means so again trying to give people some relaxation and some rest in the meantime its focused on the business going forward and youve heard us talk about the things that weve invested in and we do well continue to do that well continue to look at our distribution network but were also remaining opportunistic and there are there is a business that is out there there are opportunities coming up as clint mentioned people are working their prospects it is different theres not as much entertainment or anything of that nature dont expect that will probably change throughout the end of the year but our team has been very effective with their approach and their experience is weighing out in that and then in certain business lines weve seen a real uptick back to more of a normal preflighting new deals it wouldnt be surprising if i told you that in the second quarter our healthcare group did about of their normal volume as andy described the dental offices were foreclosed so that made perfect sense youre starting to see a lot of that come back and were looking at those very closely and not to belabor it but we do spend more time on each and every deal making sure we understand not only where theyve been but what are they doing to evolve their business in the covid environment and whats coming because now its more important than ever to understand the changes and how that could potentially impact their revenue so new loan deal takes it takes longer but its a very disciplined approach that weve always had and were sticking to it so im hopeful that provides you some color jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah it does thank you operator we have our next question comes from the line of ph david hither your line is open please go ahead q hey good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 hi ph david aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hi ph david q i just wanted to get your thoughts and you just touched on it a bit but just thoughts on organic growth loans ex ppp were down a bit more than expected it seems like this is largely due to declining ci utilization but just curious the trends youre seeing how much of this was strategic like were you tightening the credit box versus asset sales or just simply less demand for new credit and i guess thoughts on growth going forward where youre interested in growing and even where youre seeing demand from new credit andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc sure this is andy yeah i think that the second quarter was a tough quarter for everybody and so there just wasnt demand on the ci or the cre front for much activity and so i think if you look across the industry thats pretty consistent for most banks i think too the bankers were extremely distracted by the encompassing nature of ppp as weve kind of moved beyond that with the ppp and the relatively modest activities the cash build also means to pay down on the revolvers and i believe our utilization on revolvers is now so its down significantly what we are seeing though is businesses are starting to begin to get a little bit more active in the front of looking at okay i still need to keep my business running i still need to invest in capital projects that ensure that i remain competitive i think there are more modest projects than maybe what we had seen in the past we arent seeing people necessarily moving to new markets or launching new products but rather investing in what they already do and do well and so from that perspective the credit decisions are a little easier we also have seen an opening up in the construction area with the states opening up and so construction activity again is moving forward as chris noted earlier activity in the homebuilding segment is very strong and were also seeing commercial real estate projects now getting back under way and so those are kind of areas where we see growth in demand but i would characterize it as modest at this point chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah ph david id agree with andy on that but its building were seeing some things come back theres still folks that are cautious but were also starting to hear more about businesses that are potentially wanting to sell and so that transition will create opportunities and were doing all we can to be in front of our centers of influence and things and be in the right place to participate in those but again well have to look at each and every one of them with a higher level of due diligence and which makes perfect sense in this environment and i wouldnt say its any one specific area weve always had a philosophy of being in markets well be cautious but well look for opportunities that are available in any space and know that were going to have to work a little harder to maybe find the best of the best but thats part of what we do in the discipline columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 so between the production and andys credit team we work very closely and spend a lot of time right now pre flighting things and looking at them so that we end up with a good client experience and also end up with a good credit that joins our book so optimistic is the best way to look at it but theres a lot of unknowns that are out there that could change that at any time q okay thats helpful and then just kind of following up on that production commentary has there been any im just curious to get your thoughts on hiring has all of this disruption created additional opportunity for new hires and maybe expand into new markets and pick up a team thats kind of been on the short list and maybe be a bit more aggressive while a lot of others are kind of being more fearful chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah the short answer is yes we continue to look at opportunities you never know when somebody from that organization might be ready so weve always had an eye to good people good teams and were always open for that coming on board as clint mentioned were expanding our presence in boise with opening of the neighborhub there and so disruption happens across the industry at all places and different organizations are going to attack problems in different manners and that creates opportunities for the right individuals to potentially look for something different and i think our values and our culture and the way we do business attracts a certain type of individual and weve been successful at that in the past and we expect to continue to be successful with it q okay thats helpful and then just one quick one and i apologize if i missed it but do you have an estimate for net ppp fees that are expected to come through net of deferred or net of origination costs chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc well look at that im not sure that were disclosing that but i dont know you can follow up afterwards i guess q all right thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yeah i think just we havent disclosed the number but i think what ive read just from all the analysts reports and different things is i think were probably in that range of what you all are predicting for the industry as a whole relative to the amount ph bid q okay thats helpful thanks columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 operator we have our next question comes from the line of matthew clark your line is open please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning i apologize if you guys already touched on this ive been jockeying between a couple of other calls i guess with the deferrals and knowing almost half of them came from the dental portfolio do you have a sense in as you talked with your customers during the quarter what percent of that deferral amount might cure here in the third quarter aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc are you asking because you kind of broke up there at the end how many will want additional deferrals matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co no how much will cure how much will resume regular payments whats your guesstimate for the percentage aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc almost all of it matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co thats great okay and then just seattle you had indiscernible portland looks like a disaster these days i guess how is this impacting kind of daytoday not really at the bank but just among your customer base have you seen any kind of disrupt business within your portfolio or not clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc i dont know that were seeing a tremendous amount of business disruption from our clients and even our self with operations in both those areas weve had the nuisance of some broken windows and vandalism with tagging and other things that you can quickly address i think its more the underlying themes that im hearing from clients and businesses and chris and i had a meeting with one yesterday thats been located in downtown seattle for their entire 20year history their lease is up next year and theyre looking at bellevue so i think thats really the risk longer term is you had both seattle and portland are beautiful downtown cities that are on some sort of a theyre at a turning point and for several years the city council for seattle has been marginally antibusiness and i think what were seeing there is its no longer even marginal and so thats concerning but i think its also an opportunity for greater metro area i think its an opportunity for the tacoma and pierce county community where were headquartered and have a lot bigger operations and i think its a tremendous opportunity for bellevue and eastern king county and then also if you think about the portland metro area there is the opportunities across the river in vancouver and in some of the outlying communities that are outside of multnomah county there i wouldnt say im losing sleep over this but i wake up in the morning thinking about the possibility of some of the business climate that were seeing in seattle and in portland spreading to these other communities that i just mentioned columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 and then i do think then in that case it could be very disruptive to our clients thats why i think im pretty bullish on the boise idaho market as well as that the time that weve spent there and meeting with the economic development and chamber and other folks and just seeing the sheer volume of inquiries theyre getting from business relocations so times going to tell i think its were a little over a year away from elections for the city council and i think thats where well see kind of if business folks what theyre thinking and what were hearing now but it is something that i think were all closely monitoring and i dont know andy or chris have any additional insight chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc i think most of it is in there its not really disrupting our daytoday operations but its more staying close to any and all clients that we have and what their thoughts are i think the best time to kind of hammer home is one pay attention to it and then two clint summarized it well by saying time will tell but its an obvious concern for us andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc most of the activities in downtown core areas where its white collar people theyre mostly working from home anyway so its not really disrupting businesses from that perspective i think what the bigger issue for businesses mostly in the seattle market is just how business friendly the community and the city is and the taxing environment is whats really pushing people across lake washington to bellevue matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then maybe just back to the ppp how are you guys modeling kind of the forgiveness process here you kind of sensed that most of it if not all of it will be forgiven and whats your expectation on timing as you think it will be more fourth quarter and then maybe a little bit into the first quarter and then be gone clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc matthew in terms of modeling that out theres a lot of uncertainty obviously the notes are two year terms but the expectation is that a lot of it is forgiven relatively quickly were i think expecting the majority of that to happen the vast majority of it really in the back half of this year and into early next year but its really hard to say exactly what the exact timing of thats going to be chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 matthew theres also some unknowns of that of when we can submit so thats one unknown and then when we do submit when we actually receive the reimbursement so theres some things that were still unknown in that so it could drive a little bit matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and i assume indiscernible aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you cant even do it well you cant even get participants today even if you wanted to which is the beauty of this program but i think that for a lot of businesses because of the accounting impact theyre going to want to get it done in matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and i assume you have no appetite to sell to ppp loans to a third party clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc no we usually delete those inhouse when they come in matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it thank you operator we have our next question from gordon mcguire your line is open please go ahead gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc hi aaron i wanted to follow up on the margin discussion and particularly the potential for deposit outflows other than those that are ppprelated i guess i was wondering if you could hazard a guess trying to size up what that could look like aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay i will tell you this its something weve spent a lot of time thinking about because obviously the deposit flows were very strong and so weve gone back and looked at the past cycles to see what consumer and business depositor behavior was like at that time having gone through that exercise we actually feel pretty good that this should be pretty sticky funding but at the same time this is unlike anything weve really faced before so at this point i think were assuming that a lot of the ppp funds are utilized for business purposes as expected over the coming months and with the remainder of inflows that weve seen for other reasons were hopeful that a lot of that sticks around but were also going to be columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 prudent in terms of how we get that investment and so its theres just a lot of uncertainty to it but hopefully at least gives you some color on our thinking gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc nope that does and if it were to stick around if you felt more confident with it would you consider i know you typically target about million in noncore funding balances would you consider moving those lower if the lower cost deposits were stickier aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc say the question again gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc i think historically youve tried to manage noncore funding to around million and i was wondering if you do determine that these deposit inflows are a little bit more sticky whether you consider moving that million indiscernible lower aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc sorry i apologize yeah we have in fact actually already let a lot of that higher cost funding go so if it makes sense to do so we will continue to do that so weve had it in the past as part of balance sheet strategy but given where rates are now were very focused on keeping the funding costs as low as we possibly can obviously our deposit cost at basis points is hard to beat elsewhere so gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc and then just housekeeping i wanted to double check does the ppp fees do they show up in the footnote the margin footnote with the million of net deferred loan fee amortization or is that layered on top aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc repeat the question please gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc in the margin footnote where you give us the amortization levels of the net of the deferred loan fees this quarter im curious if ppp flows through that number and i think it was million this quarter clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc well follow up columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc well follow up with you offline on that one aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc the ppp would be small because those are 40year notes so they werent outstanding for very long to amortize much of the fee in the income gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay thank you operator and you have no questions at this time please continue clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc all right well thanks everyone for joining us and well look forward to another interesting
