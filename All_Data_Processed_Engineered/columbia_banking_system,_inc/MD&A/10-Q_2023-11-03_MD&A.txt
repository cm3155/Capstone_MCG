in whole or in part by the fdic table of contents executive overview the following is a discussion of our results for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the applicable prior periods financial performance comparison of current quarter to prior quarter earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended september as compared to for the three months ended june the increase for the three months ended september as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest expense largely due to a decline in mergerrelated expenses this increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses mostly attributable to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended september as compared to for the three months ended june the decrease for the three months ended september was due to higher funding costs partially offset by higher yields on loans and investments noninterest income was million for the three months ended september as compared to million for the three months ended june the increase was largely driven by a million increase in mortgage banking revenue which was a result of more favorable msr fair value adjustments compared to the prior quarter and an increase in cardbased revenue partially offset by a decrease in other income driven by an unfavorable fair value adjustment to loans held for investment noninterest expense was million for the three months ended september as compared to million for the three months ended june the decrease reflects the realization of cost savings and includes a million decrease in mergerrelated expenses and a million decrease in occupancy and equipment mainly due to consolidation of branches in the second quarter and realization of cost synergies due to the merger comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period earnings per diluted common share was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the decrease for the nine months ended september as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher funding costs related to deposit and liability mix shifting and rising interest rates and higher mergerrelated expenses associated with the merger partially offset by higher interest income on loans and leases as a result of additional loans acquired through the merger the increase in average diluted shares to million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the nine months ended september also contributed to the decline the increase in average diluted shares reflects shares issued on february in connection with the merger net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the increase for the nine months ended september was due to an increase in interest earning asset average balances and yields given upward interest rate movements with the largest average rate increase in the loan category as well as seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization these effects were partially offset by higher funding costs trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income which increased to billion for the nine months ended september compared to million for the nine months ended september partly reflecting a larger balance sheet for the nine months ended september as a result of the merger noninterest income was million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the nine months ended september the decrease was primarily driven by a million unfavorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and a million decrease in revenue related to origination and sales of residential mortgages partially offset by increases in service charges on deposits cardbased fees and financial services and trust revenue due to seven months of the higher run rate for the combined organization table of contents noninterest expense was million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the nine months ended september the increase for the nine months ended september reflects an increase in mergerrelated expenses of million in addition to seven months of the higher expense run rate for the combined organization comparison of current period to prior year end period total loans and leases were billion as of september an increase of billion as compared to december the increase in total loans was primarily due to billion in loans acquired through the merger total deposits were billion as of september an increase of billion as compared to december the increase was primarily due to billion in deposits assumed through the merger partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening total consolidated assets were billion and billion as of september and december respectively the increase was primarily due to billion in acquired assets as a result of the merger with the bulk of the increase being attributable to loans and investment securities acquired through the merger and an increase in goodwill of billion during the period credit quality nonperforming assets increased to million or of total assets as of september compared to million or of total assets as of december nonperforming loans and leases were million or of total loans and leases as of september compared to million or of total loans and leases as of december the increases in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans primarily reflect assets acquired as a result of the merger as well as isolated credit deterioration related to two specific commercial accounts the ratios are moving toward a more standard credit environment following a phase of exceptionally high quality performance the allowance for credit losses was million as of september an increase of million compared to december the increase in the allowance for credit losses was due to the growth of the loan portfolio largely due to loans acquired through the merger and changes in the economic forecasts used in the credit models related to the merger the allowance includes a million upward adjustment due to pcd loans acquired through the merger the company had a provision for credit losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively this compares to a provision for credit losses of million for the three months ended june and million for the nine months ended september the increase for the three months ended september compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to changes in the portfolio mix and credit migration trends the nine months ended september included an million initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans related to the merger this initial provision as well as changes to the economic forecast contributed to the increase when compared to the same period in the prior year liquidity total cash and cash equivalents were billion as of september an increase of billion from december the increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to a strategic decision to increase onbalance sheet liquidity including secured offbalance sheet lines of credit total available liquidity was billion as of september representing of total assets of total deposits and of uninsured deposits capital and growth initiatives the company realized million in annualized costsavings due to the merger by the end of the third quarter exceeding our original million target table of contents the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its common equity tier cet1 capital ratio was as of september as of december the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its cet1 capital ratio was the decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical columbia asset and liability balances as a result of the merger columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of per common share to shareholders on september fdic special assessment in may the fdic released a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank under the proposed rule the assessment base would be the estimated uninsured deposits as reported in umpqua bank and columbia state banks december call reports excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits allocated in proportion to each banks estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments would be collected over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january a final rule is not expected until later in after a public comment period and the fdics final deliberations have concluded the ultimate impact and timing of recognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing fdic deliberations critical accounting estimates in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported as a result of the merger the company has updated our critical accounting estimates management believes the acl business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult subjective or complex judgments and therefore management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses the bank has established an allowance for credit losses committee which is responsible for among other things regularly reviewing the acl methodology including allowance levels and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles cecl is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate therefore management has flexibility in selecting the methodology however the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial assets contractual term adjusted for prepayments utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors the company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the companys loan and lease portfolios loans and leases deemed to be collateral dependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis table of contents the adequacy of the acl is monitored on a regular basis and is based on managements evaluation of numerous factors including the cecl model outputs quality of the current loan portfolio the trend in the loan portfolios risk ratings current economic conditions loan concentrations loan growth rates pastdue and nonperforming trends evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans historical chargeoff and recovery experience and other pertinent information as of september the bank used moodys analytics august baseline scenario to estimate the acl to assess the sensitivity in the acl results and when necessary to inform qualitative adjustments the bank used a second scenario moodys analytics august s2 scenario that differs in terms of severity both favorable and unfavorable for additional information related to the companys acl see note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in item of this quarterly report on form 10q because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the acl could change significantly it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others management believes that the acl was adequate as of september business combinations and goodwill the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquirees results from the date of the acquisition forward the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition the company engages thirdparty specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded table of contents results of operations as of september columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis in addition columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect uhc financial results only until the closing of the merger after the close of business on february as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the first second and third quarters of and the nine months ended september may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net income of million for the three months ended september compared to net income of million for the three months ended june the increase in net income is mainly attributable to a decrease in noninterest expense and an increase in noninterest income partially offset by an increase in provision for credit loss and a decrease in net interest income the decrease in noninterest expense is mainly due to reductions in mergerrelated expenses occupancy and equipment and salaries and employee benefits all impacted by realized cost synergies due to the merger the increase in noninterest income was primarily due to an increase in cardbased fees and a favorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity the increase in provision for credit loss was due to portfolio mix changes and credit migration trends the decrease in net interest income was a result of higher funding costs partially offset by higher average yields on loans and investments as well as purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was million for the quarter as compared to million in the previous quarter at september the remaining discount on acquired loans and securities was billion the discount is expected to accrete into income over time providing a build to capital comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the nine months ended september the company had net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period in the prior year the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses as well as a decrease in noninterest income the increase in net interest income was due to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances as well as the addition of historical columbia portfolios in addition to the favorable impact of higher interest rates the increase in net interest income is due to the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was million for the nine months ended september the increase was partially offset by higher funding costs the increase in noninterest expense was mainly driven by higher mergerrelated expenses salaries and employee benefits and intangible amortization all of which were impacted by the merger the change in the provision was primarily due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans in addition to changes in the economic forecast the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage banking revenue as compared to the prior year driven by an unfavorable change in fair value of msr asset and lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages given lower volumes due to rising interest rates this unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of certain loans held for investment and higher customerrelated income due primarily to the merger table of contents the following table presents the return on average assets average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the periods indicated for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders equity return on

return on average common shareholders equity return on average tangible common shareholders equity calculation of average common tangible shareholders equity average common shareholders equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net average tangible common shareholders equity additionally management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered nongaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity and the total shareholders equity ratio the following table provides a reconciliation of ending shareholders

assets ratio tangible common equity ratio nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap table of contents net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended september was million a decrease of million compared to the three months ended june the decrease was driven by a million increase in interest expense due to higher average rates partially offset by a million increase in interest income largely driven by interest and fees on loans and leases primarily due to higher coupon interest rates the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended september as compared to for the three months ended june the decrease in net interest margin resulted from the higher average cost of interestbearing liabilities which was partially offset by higher yields on loans and leases the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended september increased by basis points as compared to the three months ended june primarily attributable to the impact of the higher interest rate environment increasing yields on floating and adjustable rate loans the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended september increased by basis points compared to the three months ended june due primarily to rising interest rates deposit costs were impacted by the decision to replace a portion of maturing fhlb advances with brokered deposits during the third quarter which increased the cost of deposits but was fairly neutral to the cost of interestbearing liabilities comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the nine months ended september was billion an increase of million compared to the nine months ended september the increase was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances attributable to the addition of historical columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year as well as seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of the higher rate environment and higher average balances in deposits largely due to the merger and term borrowings due to market liquidity tightening the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interestearning assets due to the higher rate environment and seven months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs the yield on loans and leases for the nine months ended september increased by basis points as compared to the same period in primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased by basis points for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to a higher mix of highercost time deposits and term borrowings as well as rising interest rates our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in

to for the three months ended june the majority of net chargeoffs related to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio table of contents comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period the company had a million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the nine months ended september the increase is primarily driven by the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans changes in the economic forecast and organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases the provision for credit losses recorded for the nine months ended september was as compared to for the nine months ended september for the nine months ended

ended september were as compared to for the nine months ended september the majority of net chargeoffs relate to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio typically loans in a nonaccrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become days past due at which time they are chargedoff the nonaccrual leases and equipment finance agreements of million as of september have a related allowance for credit losses of million with the remaining loans writtendown to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell and are expected to be

as compared to the three months ended june the variance for the three months ended september as compared to the three months ended june was driven by a million gain on the fair value of the msr asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a loss of million for the three months ended june the loss in the prior quarter was due to the planned sale of approximately onethird of the msr portfolio which related to billion in serviced loans and was marked to the sales price as of june in addition to this favorable change there was a favorable change of million related to losses on msr hedges when compared to the three months ended june table of contents other income for the three months ended september as compared to the three months ended june decreased primarily due to a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of million as compared to a loss of million respectively the decrease was partially offset by swap derivatives with a larger gain in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter resulting in a favorable change of million comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period services charges on deposits cardbased fees and financial services and trust revenue increased for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the merger and seven months of combined operations which resulted in higher income residential mortgage banking revenue decreased million compared to the nine months ended september the variance for the nine months ended september as compared to the nine months ended september was driven by a lower gain during the current year period of on fair value of the msr asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a fair value gain of million for the nine months ended september in addition revenue from origination and sale of mortgages decreased by million compared to the nine months ended september due to a decline in closed loan volume of forsale mortgages origination volume is generally linked to the level of interest rates when rates fall origination volume would be expected to be elevated relative to historical levels when rates rise origination volume would be expected to decline the msr asset value is also sensitive to interest rates and generally falls with lower rates and rises with higher rates resulting in fair value losses and gains respectively due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions where applicable in the latter part of management made a number of structural changes within the mortgage banking segment intended to reduce expenses limit the impact of fair value changes to the income statement and moderate portfolio mortgage growth included in these actions which were undertaken to improve profitability and enhance strategic balance sheet management was the initiation of msr hedges which were put in place with the intention of minimizing the interest rate risk of msrs and reducing net income volatility related to changes in fair value of msr assets due to valuation inputs or assumptions management notes that mortgages remain an important product for the bank and for our customers though we expect a smaller impact on the financial statements in the future as we downsized the scale of mortgage operations other income for the nine months ended september increased as compared to the nine months ended september due to a favorable change in the loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment resulting from a loss of million for the nine months ended september as compared to a loss of million for the nine months ended september the favorable change between periods was partially offset by a decrease in swap derivatives with a smaller gain for the nine months

and equipment expenses due to the second quarter of having elevated lease and fixed asset writeoffs associated with branch consolidations table of contents comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period salaries and employee benefits increased for the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september primarily due to the current year including seven months of expenses as a combined company with a larger employee base occupancy and equipment net increased for the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september due mainly to an increase in branch locations and software costs related to the merger fdic assessments increased for the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september due mainly to the impact of having a larger balance sheet as a result of the merger in addition to an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points for all insured depository institutions in

the change in total deposits the companys brokered deposits totaled billion at september compared to million at december uninsured deposits at september totaled billion as compared to billion at december the increase was primarily driven by balances added with the merger uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the banks regulatory

reclassification of select balances at september total available liquidity was billion or of uninsured deposits borrowings at september the bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million a decrease of million from december the bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the fhlb of billion at september and million at december the increase was due mainly to the addition of billion in fhlb advances from the merger and an additional million in net shortterm advances borrowed during the nine months ended september these borrowings were used to

with all covenants associated with this facility at september junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million at september and december respectively the increase is mainly due to the addition of million in subordinated debt and million in junior subordinated debt due to the merger and an million increase in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was due to the implied forward curve shifting higher partially offset by an increase in the credit spread and spot curve as of september substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth term sofr these instruments are covered under federal legislation and the federal reserves regulations implementing that legislation which allowed us to replace the libor index with forward term sofr plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread adjustment accordingly these instruments transitioned from libor to sofr as of july liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios as well as to deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources table of contents we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented and of total deposits at september and december respectively the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion at september compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources the bank maintains a substantial

september the company also has a million shortterm credit facility with an unaffiliated bank that was fully utilized to provide the company additional liquidity although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels table of contents commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of september time deposits totaled billion of which billion

requirements effective for the company follow basel iii with the company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the standardized approach in the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented cecl in the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years with a
