million for the prior year period this increase was mostly attributable to an increase in compensation and employee benefits expense partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense the increase in compensation and employee benefits expense was due to higher labor costs related to the origination of ppp loans in the second quarter of these costs rather than recognized in the period incurred are capitalized and amortized as a reduction to interest income over the life of the loan the decrease in other noninterest expense was the result of a larger provision for unfunded commitments during the prior year period table of contents comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the six months ended june noninterest expense was million compared to million for

from december cash and cash equivalents increased million loans increased million during the first six months of which was primarily the result of new loan production supplemented by ppp loans partially offset by loan payments and a decrease in line utilization debt securities available for sale were billion at june a decrease of billion from december which was largely due to the company transferring securities with a fair value of billion from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification total liabilities were billion as of june an increase of billion from december the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand and other noninterestbearing deposits driven by ppp loan funds being deposited into our clients deposit accounts at the bank stimulus funds being distributed by the federal government and reduced expenditures by consumers and business clients investment securities at june the companys investment portfolio primarily consisted of debt securities available for sale totaling billion compared to billion at december and debt securities held to maturity of billion at june the decrease in the debt securities available

june these durations take into account calls where appropriate and consensus prepayment speeds the investment securities are used by the company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies from timetotime securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the companys asset liability management committee in accordance with our investment strategy management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent table of contents the company performs a quarterly assessment to determine whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost exists amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost of an investment for accretion amortization collection of cash and previous credit losses recognized in earnings when the fair value of an available for sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses if the company intends to sell an impaired available for sale debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses at june the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december the change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the six months ended june in addition to there being less securities classified as available for sale at june than december as a result of the aforementioned transfer to the held to maturity classification at june the company had billion of debt securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of million however we did not consider these investment securities to have an indicated credit loss all of the companys debt securities held to maturity were issued by us government agencies or us governmentsponsored enterprises these securities carry the explicit andor implicit guarantee of the us government are widely recognized as risk free and have a long history of zero credit loss therefore the company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of june the following table sets forth

financial statements in item financial statements unaudited of this report credit risk management the extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal business activities our policies as well as applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management we manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints credit review approval policies and extensive ongoing internal monitoring we also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower in analyzing our existing portfolio we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating size or potential risk of loss in contrast the monitoring process for the commercial business real estate construction and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loanbyloan basis table of contents we review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and as a result the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly in the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured the loan is appropriately downgraded and if warranted placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments additionally we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than and with respect to which foreclosure is probable for the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral however if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans for additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio see the allowance for credit losses section in this managements discussion and analysis and
