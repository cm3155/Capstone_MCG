to the year ended december see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on umpqua holding corporations annual report on form 10k for the year ended december filed with the securities and exchange commission on february executive overview business combination columbia completed its previously announced merger with uhc on february promptly following the merger columbias whollyowned bank subsidiary columbia state bank merged with and into uhcs whollyowned bank subsidiary umpqua bank with umpqua bank surviving such merger the company acquired approximately billion in assets including billion in loans measured at fair value and billion in deposits the comparison of the year ended december to prior periods is significantly impacted by the merger see note business combination to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the mergers financial performance earnings per diluted common share were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december the decrease for the year ended december as compared to the prior period reflects an increase in average diluted shares to million for the year ended december as compared to million for the year ended december due to shares issued on february in connection with the merger net income was million for the year ended december as compared to million for the year ended december the increase was primarily driven by higher interest income as a result of additional loans and securities acquired through the merger and the favorable impact of higher interest rates on loan repricing as well as higher noninterest income related to customers added through the merger the increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher funding costs related to balances added through the merger deposit and liability mix shifting and rising interest rates as well as higher provision for credit loss largely due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans and higher noninterest expense due to the merger net income in was also impacted by lower mortgage banking income following strategic business changes made in and reduced demand for singlefamily mortgage loans net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december the increase is primarily due to an increase in interest earning asset yields given upward interest rate movements with the most impactful average rate increases in the loan and taxable securities categories as well as ten months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization these effects were partially offset by higher funding costs trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income which increased to billion for the year ended december compared to billion for the year ended december partly reflecting a larger balance sheet for the year ended december due to the merger noninterest income was million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december the increase was primarily driven by increases in service charges on deposits cardbased fees and financial services and trust revenue due to ten months of the higher run rate for the combined organization in addition to a favorable change in the fair value adjustment for certain loans held for investment of million partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue driven by a million decrease related to origination and sales of residential mortgages and an unfavorable change of million related to fair value of the msr asset noninterest expense was billion for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december this reflects an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million due to ten months of the higher expense run rate as a combined organization an increase in mergerrelated expenses of million an increase in intangible amortization of million due to the core deposit intangible asset associated with the merger and an increase in fdic assessments of million largely driven by the million fdic special assessment expense incurred during the fourth quarter of total gross loans and leases were billion as of december an increase of billion or compared to december the increase in total loans was primarily due to billion in loans acquired through the merger which offset the sale of million in loans during the year the bank is focused on generating business through customer relationships that drive balanced growth in loans deposits and core fee income total deposits were billion as of december an increase of billion or from december the increase was primarily due to billion in deposits acquired in the merger partially offset by lower customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening the deposit portfolio mix also reflects a migration from noninterest bearing to interestbearing accounts and alternative investments as customers evaluated the interest rate earned on excess cash balances in the higher interest rate environment total consolidated assets were billion as of december compared to billion as of december the increase was primarily due to billion in acquired assets as a result of the merger with the majority of the increase attributable to loans and investment securities refer to note business combination for more information pertaining to the completed merger credit quality nonperforming assets increased to million or of total assets as of december compared to million or of total assets as of december nonperforming loans were million or of total loans and leases as of december compared to million or of total loans and leases as of december the increases in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans reflects assets acquired in the merger and a move toward a more normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptionally highquality performance the acl was million or of loans and leases as of december an increase of million as compared to million or of loans and leases as of december the increase in the acl was due to loan portfolio growth largely reflective of loans acquired through the merger and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models as a result of the merger the acl increased by million which reflects a million upward adjustment at closing with no impact to the statement of operations due to acquired pcd loans and acquired unfunded commitments in addition to an million provision expense due to acquired nonpcd loans the company had a provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december compared to a provision for credit losses of million in the prior year the increase in provision expense for the year ended december as compared to the prior year reflects the million initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans related to the merger changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models and portfolio migration trends as a percentage of average outstanding loans and leases the provision for credit losses for the year ended december was as compared to for the prior year liquidity total cash and cash equivalents were billion as of december an increase of million from december the increase is mainly due to an increase in borrowings to support shortterm liquidity as there was reduced available liquidity within the banking industry as a result of recent volatility in response to the bank failures in early including secured offbalance sheet lines of credit total available liquidity was billion as of december representing of total assets of total deposits and of uninsured deposits capital and growth initiatives the company realized million in annualized costsavings due to the merger as of december exceeding our original million target the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its common equity tier riskbased capital ratio was as of december as compared to and respectively as of december the decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical columbia asset and liability balances added to the balance sheet as a result of the merger and we expect net capital accretion as purchase accounting marks accrete into income on a quarterly basis postclosing capital ratios as reported for the quarter ended march represented the low point for the year as regulatory capital ratios expanded thereafter as capital generated through earnings offset capital paid out to shareholders through dividends the company paid cash dividends of per common share during the year ended december fdic special assessment in november the fdic approved the final rule to impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank under the final rule the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits as reported in umpqua bank and columbia state banks december call reports excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits allocated in proportion to each banks estimated uninsured deposits the fdic will collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of the company accrued million in the fourth quarter of related to the special assessment which is included in noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of operations critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported management believes the acl business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult subjective or complex judgments and therefore management considers them to be critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses the bank has established an allowance for credit losses committee which is responsible for among other things regularly reviewing the acl methodology including allowance levels and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles cecl is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate therefore management has flexibility in selecting the methodology however the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial assets contractual term adjusted for prepayments utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors the company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the companys loan and lease portfolios loans and leases deemed to be collateraldependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis the adequacy of the acl is monitored on a regular basis and is based on managements evaluation of numerous factors including the cecl model outputs quality of the current loan portfolio the trend in the loan portfolios risk ratings current economic conditions loan concentrations loan growth rates pastdue and nonperforming trends evaluation of specific loss estimates for significant problem loans historical chargeoff and recovery experience and other pertinent information as of december the bank used moodys analytics november baseline forecast to estimate the acl to assess the sensitivity in the acl results and when necessary to inform qualitative adjustments the bank used a second scenario moodys analytics november s2 scenario that differs in terms of severity for additional information related to the companys acl see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form 10k because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the acl could change significantly it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others management believes that the acl was adequate as of december business combinations the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquirees results from the date of the acquisition forward the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the acl for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the acl for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition the company engages thirdparty specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of october each year and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the difference is the amount of impairment and goodwill is written down to the fair value of the reporting unit the company has a single reporting unit in testing goodwill the company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in this qualitative assessment the company evaluates events and circumstances which may include but are not limited to the general economic environment banking industry and market conditions a significant adverse change in legal factors significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected the company performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments about economic and industry factors and the growth and earnings prospects of the bank variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test it was determined that no goodwill impairment charges were required as our single reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying amount as of december we determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below results of operations as of december columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february the merger date reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis accordingly columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect only uhc financial results through the closing of the merger as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the year ended december may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current year to prior year for the year ended december the company had net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period in the prior year the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses the increase in net interest income was due to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances as well as the addition of historical columbia portfolios in addition to the favorable impact of higher interest rates the increase in net interest income is due to the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was million for the year ended december these increases were partially offset by higher funding costs the increase in noninterest expense was mainly driven by higher salaries and employee benefits mergerrelated expense and intangible amortization all of which were impacted by the merger the change in the provision was primarily due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans in addition to changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models and portfolio migration trends the following table presents the return on average assets gaap average common shareholders equity gaap and average tangible common shareholders equity nongaap for the years ended december and for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the

capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the

these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap net interest income net interest income for increased by million or compared to the same period in due primarily to a billion increase in loan interest income resulting from higher average rates and higher average loan and lease balances attributable to the addition of historical columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year as well as ten months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization partially offset by a million increase in interest expense on deposits as a result of the higher rate environment and higher average balances in deposits largely due to the merger and a million increase in term borrowings to support liquidity due to industrywide deposit balance contraction general liquidity management and loan and lease growth that outpaced deposit growth during when acquired balances are excluded the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for an increase of basis points compared to this increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interestearning assets due to the higher rate environment and ten months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs the yield on loans and leases for increased by basis points as compared to primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased basis points for as compared to due to a higher mix of highercost time deposits and term borrowings as well as rising interest rates driving up the cost of other deposits our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds the federal reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by between march and july which marked the final increase to the federal funds rate to date during the current interest rate cycle during that period our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the federal reserve since the federal reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate we have experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaces the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits have continued to reprice higher and our funding base has experienced a shift toward highercost sources as federal reserve actions have reduced available liquidity within the banking industry as a result our net interest margin contracted from in august to in december due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets our cost of funds in was significantly impacted by higher balances in noncore funding sources such as brokered deposits and term borrowings which carry a higher rate of interest as compared to our core deposit funding base these balances along with higher balances in public funds time deposits and other highercost deposit categories contributed to an increase in our cost of interest bearing deposits and interest bearing liabilities to and in december from and in august respectively the cost of interest bearing deposits and interest bearing liabilities as of december the spot rate was and respectively detailing that our cost of funds continued to increase through the month of december additional shifts in our funding mix will likely continue to pressure our cost of funds in financial statement note interestbearing deposits

provision for credit losses the company had a million provision for credit losses for as compared to an million provision for credit losses for the increase is primarily driven by the initial

compared to net chargeoffs of million or of average loans and leases for the majority of net chargeoffs relate to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio typically loans in nonaccrual status will not have an acl as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged off however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an acl

current year compared to million in the prior year in addition revenue from origination and sale of mortgages decreased by million compared to the prior period due to a decline in closed loan volume of forsale mortgages the company undertook several strategic actions in and to restructure its mortgage business given lower mortgage origination volume in the higher rate environment and a focus on relationship banking that drives balanced growth in loans deposits and core fee income these changes were intended to reduce expenses limit the impact of fair value changes to the statement of operations and moderate portfolio mortgage growth and they include the sale of approximately onethird of the msr portfolio in september which related to a nonrelationship component of the serviced loan portfolio this sale had a small contribution to the decrease in mortgage banking revenue during as servicing income declined in the fourth quarter of due to a smaller serviced loan portfolio due

thousands december december balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans table end residential msr are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of operations the value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive prepayments increase and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline historically the fair value of our residential msr will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall due to changes to inputs in the valuation model including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds the fair value of the msr asset decreased by million for the year ended december as compared to an increase of million for the year ended december in september the company closed the sale of million in mortgage servicing rights associated with billion of residential mortgage loans serviced for others the fair value of the msr

a potential impairment for the year ended december there were no goodwill impairment losses recognized as of december we had other intangible assets of million compared to million as of december the increase is as a result of the core deposit intangible asset of million associated with the merger partially offset by amortization of million during the year ended december as part of a business acquisition the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit was recognized at the merger date intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives the core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of years using the sumoftheyearsdigits method intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment no impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented deposits total deposits were billion as of december an increase of billion or compared to yearend the increase is mainly attributable to the addition of billion in deposits related to the merger partially offset by lower customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening the deposit portfolio mix also reflects a migration from noninterest bearing to interestbearing accounts and alternative investments as customers evaluated the interest rate earned on excess cash balances in the higher interest rate environment the

total brokered deposits were billion or of total deposits as of december compared to million or of total deposits as of december primarily due to increases in brokered cds to fund loan growth and liquidity needs the fdic generally provides a standard amount of insurance of per depositor for each account ownership category defined by the fdic depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over

insured up to the standard insurance amount as of december and december approximately billion or and billion or respectively of the banks deposits were estimated to be insured uninsured deposits as of december totaled billion as compared to billion as of december the increase was primarily driven by balances added with the merger uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the banks regulatory requirements we reviewed our methodologies and assumptions following the industry events that brought the level of uninsured deposits into focus during

outstanding borrowings consisting of fhlb advances of billion and frb btfp borrowings of million as of december total borrowings increased billion since december primarily due to borrowings added

refinance or repay balances without penalty the frb borrowings are secured by investment securities junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million as of december and respectively the increase is mainly due to the addition of million in subordinated debt and million in junior subordinated debt due to the merger partially offset by a million decrease in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was due to a decrease in the implied forward curve and the spot curve shifting higher partially offset by a decrease in credit spread as of december substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth term sofr these instruments are covered under federal legislation and the federal reserves regulations implementing that legislation which allowed us to replace the libor index with forward term sofr plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread adjustment accordingly these instruments transitioned from libor to sofr as of july liquidity and sources of funds the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios as well as to deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented of total deposits at both december and the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion as of december compared with billion as of december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources the bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of offbalance sheet funding sources these liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit advances from the fhlb the federal reserve banks discount window and the btfp the ability to take new advances under the btfp ends in march availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal

the company in there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company fdic and oregon division of financial regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from umpqua bank to the company although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligation s the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as
