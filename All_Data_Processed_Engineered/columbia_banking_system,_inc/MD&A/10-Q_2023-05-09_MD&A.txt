the fdic executive overview the following is a discussion of our results for the three months ended march as compared to the applicable prior periods financial performance earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the decrease for the three months ended march as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense largely due to mergerrelated expenses associated with the merger as well as an increase in provision expense due to the initial provision for nonpcd loans added with the merger this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net interest income as a result of there being one month of income as a combined organization in addition to the net favorable impact of higher interest rates net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the increase for the three months ended march was due to an increase in interest earning asset yields given upward interest rate movements with the largest average rate increase in the loan category as well as one month of purchase accounting accretion and amortization these effects were partially offset by higher funding costs trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income which increased to million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended december noninterest income was million for the three months ended march as compared to million for the three months ended december while results benefited from one month as a combined organization the increase was primarily driven by a million favorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity noninterest expense was million for the three months ended march as compared to million for the three months ended december the increase for the three months ended march reflects one month of the higher expense rate of the combined organization as well as an increase in mergerrelated expenses which accounted for million of the million linkedquarter increase total loans and leases were billion as of march an increase of billion as compared to december the increase in total loans was primarily due to acquired loans associated with the merger total deposits were billion as of march an increase of billion as compared to december the increase was primarily due to billion in deposits assumed through the merger partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening total consolidated assets were billion and billion as of march and december respectively the increase was primarily due to billion in acquired assets as a result of the merger with the bulk of the increase being attributable to loans and investment securities credit quality nonperforming assets increased to million or of total assets as of march compared to million or of total assets as of december nonperforming loans and leases were million or of total loans and leases as of march compared to million or of total loans and leases as of december the increases in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans primarily reflect assets acquired as a result of the merger the allowance for credit losses was million as of march an increase of million compared to december the increase in the allowance for credit losses was due to the growth of the loan portfolio largely due to loans acquired through the merger and changes in the economic forecasts used in the credit models the allowance also includes a million adjustment related to pcd loans acquired through the merger the company had a provision for credit losses of million for the three months ended march this compares to a provision for credit losses of million for the three months ended december the increase was mainly due to the million initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans related to the merger in addition to changes in the economic forecast liquidity total cash and cash equivalents was billion as of march an increase of billion from december the increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to a strategic decision to increase onbalance sheet liquidity including secured offbalance sheet lines of credit total available liquidity was billion as of march representing of total assets of total deposits and of uninsured deposits capital and growth initiatives the merger closed on february columbia completed its core systems conversion on march and branch consolidations are scheduled to occur through the second quarter of the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its common equity tier cet1 capital ratio was as of march as of december the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its cet1 capital ratio was the decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical columbia asset and liability balances as a result of the merger uhc paid a quarterly cash dividend of per common share to shareholders on february the per share amount has been adjusted as a result of the adjustment to common shares outstanding based on the exchange ratio critical accounting estimates in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported as a result of the merger the company has updated our critical accounting estimates management believes the acl business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult subjective or complex judgments and therefore management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses the bank has established an allowance for credit losses committee which is responsible for among other things regularly reviewing the acl methodology including allowance levels and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles cecl is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate therefore management has flexibility in selecting the methodology however the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial assets contractual term adjusted for prepayments utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors the company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the companys loan and lease portfolios loans and leases deemed to be collateral dependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis the adequacy of the acl is monitored on a regular basis and is based on managements evaluation of numerous factors including the cecl model outputs quality of the current loan portfolio the trend in the loan portfolios risk ratings current economic conditions loan concentrations loan growth rates pastdue and nonperforming trends evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans historical chargeoff and recovery experience and other pertinent information as of march the bank used moodys analytics february baseline scenario to estimate the acl to assess the sensitivity in the acl results and when necessary to inform qualitative adjustments the bank used a second scenario moodys analytics february s2 scenario that differs in terms of severity within the variables both favorable and unfavorable for additional information related to the companys acl see note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in item of this quarterly report on form 10q because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the acl could change significantly it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others management believes that the acl was adequate as of march business combinations and goodwill the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquirees results from the date of the acquisition forward the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition the company engages thirdparty specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded results of operations as of march columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis in addition columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect uhc financial results only until the closing of the merger after the close of business on february as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the first quarter of may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net loss of million for the three months ended march compared to net income of million for the three months ended december the decrease in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in net interest income the increase in noninterest expense is mainly due to increases in mergerrelated expenses salaries and benefits and intangible amortization all of which were impacted by the merger the change in the provision was mainly driven by million in initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans in addition to changes in the economic forecast the increase in net interest income is mainly due to there being one month of higher income as a result of the merger in addition to the net favorable impact of higher interest rates comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the three months ended march the company had net loss of million a decrease in net income of million as compared to the same period in the prior year mainly attributable to increases in noninterest expense provision for credit loss and a decrease in noninterest income partially offset by an increase in net interest income the increase in noninterest expense was driven by increased mergerrelated expenses salaries and employee benefits and intangible amortization all of which were impacted by the merger the change in the provision of million was mainly driven by the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans in addition to changes in the economic forecast the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a decrease of million in residential mortgage banking revenue as compared to the prior year due to lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages given lower volumes and gain on sale margins due to rising interest rates the increase in net interest income was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances as well as the addition of historical columbia portfolios partially offset by higher funding costs the following table presents the return on average assets average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the three months ended march december and march respectively for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction

common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered nongaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity and the total shareholders equity ratio the following table provides a

shareholders equity to total assets ratio tangible common equity ratio nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended march was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended december the increase was driven by a million increase in the total interest and fees on loans and leases and a million increase in interest on taxable investments mainly due to higher coupon interest rates and the addition of historical columbia portfolios as a result of the merger higher interest income was partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense due to migration to highercost deposits and borrowings and the addition of historical columbia balances the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields for each category within interestearning assets given upward interest rate movements partially offset by higher funding costs the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended march increased by basis points as compared to the three months ended december primarily attributable to the impact of the higher interest rate environment increasing yields on floating and adjustable rate loans as well as one month of purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended march increased by basis points compared to the three months ended december due primarily to rising interest rates changes in the deposit mix to higher rate products and the increase in outstanding term borrowings comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the three months ended march was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended march the increase was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances attributable to the addition of historical columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended march the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interestearning assets due to the higher rate environment which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended march increased by basis points as compared to the same period in primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased by basis points for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to a higher mix of highercost deposits and term borrowings our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates

portfolio typically loans in a nonaccrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become days past due at which time they are chargedoff the nonaccrual leases and equipment finance agreements of million as of march have a related allowance for credit losses of million with the remaining loans writtendown to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell and are expected to be resolved

generally higher due to there being one month of higher income as result of the merger which included one month of combined operations comparison of current quarter to prior quarter residential mortgage banking revenue increased million as compared to the three months ended december the variance for the three months ended march as compared to the three months ended december was driven by a

residential mortgage banking revenue decreased million compared to the three months ended march the variance for the three months ended march as compared to the three months ended march was driven by a loss of million on the fair value of the msr asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a fair value gain of million for the three months ended march the variance between periods was also driven by an decline in closed loan volume of forsale mortgages which was the primary driver of a million decrease in revenue from the origination and sale of mortgages compared to the three months ended march origination volume is generally linked to the level of interest rates when rates fall origination volume would be expected to be elevated relative to historical levels when rates rise origination volume would be expected to decline the msr asset value is also sensitive to interest rates and generally falls with lower rates and rises with higher rates resulting in fair value losses and gains respectively due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions where applicable in august a msr hedge was put in place with the intention of minimizing the interest rate risk of msrs and reducing net income volatility related to changes in fair value of msr assets due to valuation inputs or assumptions other income for the three months ended march decreased as compared to the three months ended march due mainly to a gain on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of million for the three months ended march as compared to a fair value loss of million for the

historical columbia securities portfolio during the first week of march by selling billion of securities and purchasing million of securities with the proceeds the restructure transactions resulted in

march of loan and leases outstanding commercial real estate commercial residential consumer other total allowance for credit losses of loans and leases outstanding to calculate the acl the cecl models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the banks loan and lease portfolios for the first quarter of the bank used moodys analytics february baseline economic forecast which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter key components include us real gdp average annualized growth of in in in and in and an average unemployment rate of in in in and in the forecasted average federal funds rate is expected to be in in in and in the models for calculating the acl are sensitive to changes in these and other economic variables which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time we believe that the acl as of march is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available if the economic conditions decline the bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods residential mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the changes in our residential msr portfolio for the three months ended march and december three months ended in thousands march december balance beginning of period additions for new msr capitalized changes in fair value changes due to collectionrealization of expected cash flows over time changes due to valuation inputs or assumptions balance end of period the changes in valuation inputs and assumptions principally reflect changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of march and december was as follows dollars in thousands march december balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans residential msr are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue the value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive prepayments increase and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline historically the fair value of our residential msr will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall mortgage rates decreased only slightly during the quarter however due to the difference in the portfolios average interest rates and the current mortgage rates msr assets are holding their value due to changes to inputs in the valuation model including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds the fair value of the msr asset decreased by million for the three months ended march as compared to a decrease of million for the three months ended december the fair value of the msr asset decreased by million due to the passage of time including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments paydowns and payoffs during the three months ended march as compared to a decrease of million for the three months ended december goodwill and other intangible assets on february the company completed the merger which resulted in billion in goodwill as compared to no goodwill at december goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired at march we had other intangible assets of million as compared to million at december as part of a business acquisition the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit was recognized at the merger date intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives and are also reviewed for impairment the core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of years deposits total deposits were billion at march an increase of billion as compared to december the increase is attributable to the addition of billion in deposits related to the merger offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening the following table presents the deposit balances by category as of march and december march december  in thousands amount amount noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market savings time greater than time or less total deposits the companys total core deposits which are deposits less time deposits greater than and all brokered deposits were billion at march compared to billion at december the increase in total core deposits between periods was driven by the same factors that contributed to the change in total deposits the companys brokered deposits totaled billion at march compared to million at december uninsured deposits at march totaled billion as compared to billion at december the increase was primarily driven by balances added with the merger uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the banks regulatory requirements we reviewed our methodologies and assumptions following the industry events that brought the level of uninsured deposits into focus in march which resulted in the reclassification of select balances including collateralized public funds which are no longer included in our uninsured balance calculations at march total available liquidity was billion or of uninsured deposits borrowings at march the bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million a decrease of million from december the bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the fhlb of billion at march and million at december the increase was due mainly to the addition of billion in fhlb advances from the merger and an additional billion in net shortterm advances borrowed during the period which were used to fund liquidity for the quarter fhlb advances have fixed rates ranging from to and are set to mature before the end of advances from the fhlb are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate columbia has a million shortterm credit facility with an unaffiliated bank as of march million was outstanding at a variable rate of and expires on may the credit agreement requires the company to comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels the company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at march junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million at march and december respectively the decrease is mainly due to the million decline in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value which is due to an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the credit spread the decrease was partially offset by the addition of million in subordinated debt and million in junior subordinated debt due to the merger as of march substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth libor these instruments mature after june and are covered under federal legislation and the federal reserves regulations implementing that legislation that will allow us to replace the libor index with forward term sofr plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread adjustment liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios as well as to deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented and of total deposits at march and december respectively the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit sell securities under agreements to repurchase borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion at march compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at march subject to certain collateral requirements namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities the bank had available lines of credit with the federal reserve totaling billion subject to certain collateral requirements namely the amount of certain pledged loans the bank also has access to the frb bank term funding program with an available line of credit of billion subject to certain collateral requirements namely the amount of pledged investment securities the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million at march availability of these lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility these lines are intended to support shortterm liquidity needs and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity substantially all of the companys revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank there were million of dividends paid by the bank to the company in the three months ended march there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company fdic and oregon division of financial regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from umpqua bank to the company as of march the company also has a million shortterm credit facility with an unaffiliated bank that was fully utilized to provide the company additional liquidity although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of march time deposits totaled billion of which billion matures in a year or less total borrowings as of march were billion all of which matures within year these arrangements also include offbalance sheet commitments to extend credit letters of credit and various forms of guarantees at march our loan commitments were billion however a portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn refer to note commitments and contingencies for further information financing commitments letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used offbalancesheet arrangements information regarding offbalancesheet arrangements is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements concentrations of credit risk information regarding concentrations of credit risk is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements capital resources shareholders equity at march was billion the increase in shareholders equity during the three months ended march was principally due to the increase in common stock of billion as a result of the merger this was offset by cash dividends paid of million and a net loss of million during the period the companys dividend policy considers among other things earnings regulatory capital levels the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared if any on a quarterly basis there is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased we cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings regulatory restrictions and limitations changes to our capital requirements or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels or at all on january uhc declared a cash dividend in the amount of per common share based on fourth quarter performance which was paid on february uhc accelerated its dividend declaration timeline in january ahead of the anticipated merger with columbia historically uhc declared quarterly cash dividends later in the quarter and columbia intends to adopt this timeline given the merger the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share for the three months ended march december and march three months ended march december march dividend declared per common share dividend payout ratio nm the company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit the company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements effective for the company follow basel iii with the company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of riskweighted assets under the standardized approach in the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented cecl in the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years with a threeyear transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the twoyear delay the company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting cecl relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital currently the company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of by adjusting it by in through and in culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in all regulatory ratios
