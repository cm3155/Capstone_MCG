colorado and utah umpqua bank is an oregon statechartered commercial bank the deposits of which are insured in whole or in part by the fdic executive overview the following is a discussion of our results for the three and six months ended june as compared to the applicable prior periods financial performance comparison of current quarter to prior quarter earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the increase for the three months ended june as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by an increase in interest income on loans and leases due to the prior quarter only including one month as a combined company a decrease in mergerrelated expenses and a decrease in provision expense due to the prior quarter including the initial provision for nonpcd loans added with the merger these favorable changes were partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher funding costs related to deposit and liability mix shifting and rising interest rates net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended june was due to higher average yield on interestbearing liabilities in addition to a lower mix of loans as a percentage of earning assets due in part to the fullquarter of the combined company balance sheet the net interest margin was also impacted by lower accretion as higher interest rates have slowed prepayment speeds which has delayed the realization of the discount on acquired loans and securities into income noninterest income was million for the three months ended june as compared to million for the three months ended march the decrease was primarily driven by a million unfavorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity partially offset by increases in financial services and trust revenue service charges on deposits and cardbased fees noninterest expense was million for the three months ended june as compared to million for the three months ended march the decrease reflects an million decrease in mergerrelated expenses partially offset by the full quarter run rate of the combined organization comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period earnings per diluted common share was for the six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the decrease for the six months ended june as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher funding costs related to deposit and liability mix shifting and rising interest rates and higher mergerrelated expense associated with the merger partially offset by higher interest income on loans and leases as a result of additional loans acquired through the merger an increase in average diluted shares to million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the six months ended june also contributed to the decline in earnings per diluted common share between periods the increase in average diluted shares reflects shares issued on february in connection with the merger net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the increase for the six months ended june was due to an increase in interest earning asset average balances and yields given upward interest rate movements with the largest average rate increase in the loan category as well as four months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization these effects were partially offset by higher funding costs trends affecting net interest margin had a similar impact on net interest income which increased to million for the six months ended june compared to million for the six months ended june partly reflecting a larger balance sheet for the six months ended june as a result of the merger table of contents noninterest income was million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the six months ended june the decrease was primarily driven by a million unfavorable change in cumulative fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity and a million decrease in revenue related to origination and sales of residential mortgages partially offset by increases in financial services and trust revenue service charges on deposits and cardbased fees due to four months of the higher run rate for the combined organization noninterest expense was million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the six months ended june the increase for the six months ended june reflects an increase in mergerrelated expenses of million in addition to four months of the higher expense run rate for the combined organization comparison of current period to prior year end period total loans and leases were billion as of june an increase of billion as compared to december the increase in total loans was primarily due to billion in loans acquired through the merger total deposits were billion as of june an increase of billion as compared to december the increase was primarily due to billion in deposits assumed through the merger partially offset by declining existing customer balances due primarily to the impact of inflation and market liquidity tightening total consolidated assets were billion and billion as of june and december respectively the increase was primarily due to billion in acquired assets as a result of the merger with the bulk of the increase being attributable to loans and investment securities and an increase in goodwill of billion during the period credit quality nonperforming assets increased to million or of total assets as of june compared to million or of total assets as of december nonperforming loans and leases were million or of total loans and leases as of june compared to million or of total loans and leases as of december the increases in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans primarily reflect assets acquired as a result of the merger the allowance for credit losses was million as of june an increase of million compared to december the increase in the allowance for credit losses was due to the growth of the loan portfolio largely due to loans acquired through the merger and changes in the economic forecasts used in the credit models the allowance also includes a million upward adjustment related to pcd loans acquired through the merger the company had a provision for credit losses of million and million for the three and six months ended june respectively this compares to a provision for credit losses of million for the three months ended march and million for the six months ended june the decrease for the three months ended june compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to the prior quarter including an million initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans related to the merger this initial provision in addition to changes in the economic forecast contributed to the increase for the six month period ended june when compared to the same period in the prior year liquidity total cash and cash equivalents were billion as of june an increase of billion from december the increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to a strategic decision to increase onbalance sheet liquidity including secured offbalance sheet lines of credit total available liquidity was billion as of june representing of total assets of total deposits and of uninsured deposits table of contents capital and growth initiatives columbia completed the planned consolidation of branches during the latter half of the second quarter of the company remains on track to realize million in annualized costsavings expectations by the end of the third quarter inclusive of million in annualized savings achieved through june the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its common equity tier cet1 capital ratio was as of june as of december the companys total riskbased capital ratio was and its cet1 capital ratio was the decline in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by initial fair value marks related to historical columbia asset and liability balances as a result of the merger columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of per common share to shareholders on june fdic special assessment in may the fdic released a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank under the proposed rule the assessment base would be the estimated uninsured deposits as reported in umpqua bank and columbia state banks december call reports excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits allocated in proportion to each banks estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments would be collected over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january a final rule is not expected until later in after a public comment period and the fdics final deliberations have concluded the ultimate impact and timing of recognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing fdic deliberations critical accounting estimates in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported as a result of the merger the company has updated our critical accounting estimates management believes the acl business combinations and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult subjective or complex judgments and therefore management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses the bank has established an allowance for credit losses committee which is responsible for among other things regularly reviewing the acl methodology including allowance levels and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles cecl is not prescriptive in the methodology used to determine the expected credit loss estimate therefore management has flexibility in selecting the methodology however the expected credit losses must be estimated over a financial assets contractual term adjusted for prepayments utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors table of contents the company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables related to each of the companys loan and lease portfolios loans and leases deemed to be collateral dependent are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis the adequacy of the acl is monitored on a regular basis and is based on managements evaluation of numerous factors including the cecl model outputs quality of the current loan portfolio the trend in the loan portfolios risk ratings current economic conditions loan concentrations loan growth rates pastdue and nonperforming trends evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans historical chargeoff and recovery experience and other pertinent information as of june the bank used moodys analytics may baseline scenario to estimate the acl to assess the sensitivity in the acl results and when necessary to inform qualitative adjustments the bank used a second scenario moodys analytics may s2 scenario that differs in terms of severity within the variables both favorable and unfavorable for additional information related to the companys acl see note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in item of this quarterly report on form 10q because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the acl could change significantly it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others management believes that the acl was adequate as of june business combinations and goodwill the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under this accounting method the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with the acquirees results from the date of the acquisition forward the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the statement of operations over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition the company engages thirdparty specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the effective time of the acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the effective time of the acquisition that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill is recorded table of contents results of operations as of june columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis in addition columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect uhc financial results only until the closing of the merger after the close of business on february as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the first and second quarters of and the six months ended june may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net income of million for the three months ended june compared to net loss of million for the three months ended march the increase in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income a decrease in provision for credit loss and a decrease in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income the increase in net interest income is mainly due to this being the first full quarter of income as a combined company after the merger in addition to the favorable impact of higher interest rates as well as the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization that was million for the quarter as compared to million in the first quarter at june the remaining discount on acquired loans and securities was billion the discount is expected to accrete into income over time providing a steady build to capital the change in the provision was mainly driven by the prior quarter including the million in initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans the decrease in noninterest expense is mainly due to a reduction in mergerrelated expenses partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits intangible amortization and occupancy and equipment net all of which were impacted by the merger due to this being the first full quarter as a combined company intangible amortization was million for the quarter as compared to million in the first quarter at june the remaining balance of core deposit intangible assets was million being amortized over years using the sumofyearsdigits based upon the period over which estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage banking revenue driven by a loss in the msr hedges and a decrease in other income which included an unfavorable change in the fair value of certain loans held for investment comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the six months ended june the company had net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period in the prior year the decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in noninterest expense an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest income partially offset by an increase in net interest income the increase in noninterest expense was mainly driven by higher mergerrelated expenses salaries and employee benefits and intangible amortization all of which were impacted by the merger the change in the provision was primarily due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans in addition to changes in the economic forecast the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage banking revenue as compared to the prior year driven by an unfavorable change in valuation inputs or assumptions and lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages given lower volumes due to rising interest rates this unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of certain loans held for investment the increase in net interest income was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances as well as the addition of historical columbia portfolios partially offset by higher funding costs table of contents the following table presents the return on average assets average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the periods indicated for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders equity return on average assets common shareholders equity and tangible common shareholders

shareholders equity calculation of average common tangible shareholders equity average common shareholders equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net average tangible common

intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered nongaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders

limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap table of contents net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended june was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended march the increase was driven by a million increase in the total interest and fees on loans and leases and a million increase in interest on taxable investments mainly due to higher coupon interest rates and higher average balances primarily due to the addition of historical columbia portfolios as a result of the merger and three months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization as compared to one month in the previous quarter higher interest income was partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense due to higher average rates and higher average balances as a result of increased term borrowings and this being the first full quarter as a combined company with the addition of historical columbia balances the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the decrease in net interest margin resulted from the higher average cost of interestbearing liabilities in addition to a lower mix of loans as a percentage of earning assets the net interest margin was also impacted by lower accretion as higher interest rates have slowed prepayment speeds which has delayed the realization of the discount on acquired loans and securities into income the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended june increased by basis points as compared to the three months ended march primarily attributable to the impact of the higher interest rate environment increasing yields on floating and adjustable rate loans as well as a full quarter of purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended june increased by basis points compared to the three months ended march due primarily to rising interest rates and an increase in outstanding term borrowings comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the six months ended june was million an increase of million compared to the six months ended june the increase was due primarily to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances attributable to the addition of historical columbia portfolios and organic growth over the past year as well as four months of purchase accounting accretion and amortization partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of the higher rate environment and higher average balances in deposits and term borrowings the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in the average yields on interestearning assets due to the higher rate environment which more than offset correspondingly higher funding costs the yield on loans and leases for the six months ended june increased by basis points as compared to the same period in primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased by basis points for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to a higher mix of highercost time and money market deposits and term borrowings our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on deposits and

investment security income has been adjusted to a taxequivalent basis at a tax rate provision for credit losses comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had a million provision for credit losses for the three months ended june as compared to a million provision for the three months ended march the decrease is primarily due to the march provision reflecting an initial provision of million for historical columbia nonpcd loans as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended june was as compared to for the three months ended march for the three months ended june net chargeoffs were million as compared to million for the three months ended march as an annualized percentage of average

loans included within the commercial loan portfolio table of contents comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period the company had a million provision for credit losses for the six months ended june as compared to million for the six months ended june the increase is primarily driven by the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans changes in the economic forecast and

outstanding loans and leases net chargeoffs for the six months ended june were as compared to for the six months ended june the majority of net chargeoffs relate to leases and equipment finance loans included within the commercial loan portfolio typically loans in a nonaccrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become days past due at which time they are chargedoff the nonaccrual leases and equipment finance agreements of million as of june have a related allowance for credit losses of million with the remaining loans writtendown to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell

million as compared to the three months ended march the variance for the three months ended june as compared to the three months ended march was driven by a planned sale of approximately billion of the msr portfolio in the latter half of which were marked to the sales price as of june as well as a million loss on msr hedges compared to a gain of million for the three months ended march table of contents other income for the three months ended june as compared to the three months ended march decreased primarily due to a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of million as

million comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period residential mortgage banking revenue decreased million compared to the six months ended june the variance for the six months ended june as compared to the six months ended june was driven by a loss of million on the fair value of the msr asset due to valuation inputs or assumptions compared to a fair value gain of million for the six months ended june the decrease was due in part to a planned sale of approximately billion of the msr portfolio in the latter half of which were marked to the sales price as of june in addition revenue from origination and sale of mortgages decreased by million compared to the six months ended june due to an decline in closed loan volume of forsale mortgages origination volume is generally linked to the level of interest rates when rates fall origination volume would be expected to be elevated relative to historical levels when rates rise origination volume would be expected to decline the msr asset value is also sensitive to interest rates and generally falls with lower rates and rises with higher rates resulting in fair value losses and gains respectively due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions where applicable in the latter part of management made a number of structural changes within the mortgage banking segment intended to reduce expenses limit the impact of fair value changes to the income statement and moderate portfolio mortgage growth included in these actions which were undertaken to improve profitability and enhance strategic balance sheet management was the initiation of msr hedges in august msr hedges were put in place with the intention of minimizing the interest rate risk of msrs and reducing net income volatility related to changes in fair value of msr assets due to valuation inputs or assumptions management notes that mortgages remain an important product for the bank and for our customers though we expect a smaller impact on the financial statements in the future as we downsized the scale of mortgage operations other income for the six months ended june increased as compared to the six months ended june due mainly to a gain on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of million for the six months ended june as compared to a fair value loss of million for the six months ended june the favorable change between periods was

to calculate the acl the cecl models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the banks loan and lease

allowance for credit losses for further information on key components of the forecast the models for calculating the acl are sensitive to changes to economic variables which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time we believe that the acl as of june is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available if the economic conditions decline the bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods table of contents residential mortgage servicing

presents information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of the dates presented dollars in thousands june december balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans residential msr are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue the value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive prepayments increase and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline historically the fair value of our residential msr will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall due to changes to inputs in the valuation model including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds the fair value of the msr asset decreased by million for the three months ended june as compared to a decrease of million for the three months ended march and decreased million for the six months ended june as compared to an increase of million for the six months ended june

reviewed for impairment the core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of years using the sumoftheyearsdigits method table of contents deposits total deposits were billion at june an increase of billion as compared to december the increase is attributable to the addition of billion in deposits related to the merger offset by declining existing

contributed to the change in total deposits the companys brokered deposits totaled billion at june compared to million at december uninsured deposits at june totaled billion as compared to billion at december the increase was primarily driven by balances added with the merger uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the banks regulatory requirements we reviewed our methodologies and assumptions following the industry events that brought the level of uninsured deposits into focus during the first half of which resulted in the reclassification of select balances at june total available liquidity was billion or of uninsured deposits borrowings at june the bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million a decrease of million from december the bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the fhlb of billion at june and million at december the increase was due mainly to the

comply with certain covenants including those related to asset quality and capital levels the company was in compliance with all covenants associated with this facility at june junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million at june and december respectively the increase is mainly due to the addition of million in subordinated debt and million in junior subordinated debt due to the merger partially offset by an million decline in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was due to fluctuations in the discount rate which increased in the first quarter due to credit spreads that were elevated due to bank failures late in the quarter but declined in the second quarter as of june substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth libor these instruments are covered under federal legislation and the federal reserves regulations implementing that legislation which allowed us to replace the libor index with forward

objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining a sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity position to provide flexibility to grow deposit balances and fund growth in lending and investment portfolios as well as to deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented and of total deposits at june and december respectively the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion at june compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources the bank maintains a substantial

the company also has a million shortterm credit facility with an unaffiliated bank that was fully utilized to provide the company additional liquidity although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of june time deposits totaled billion of which billion matures in a year or less total
