file annual reports on s table of contents deposit insurance the banks deposits are insured under the fdia up to the maximum applicable limits and are subject to deposit insurance assessments designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose under the fdics assessment system for determining payments to the dif large idis with more than billion in assets are assessed under a complex scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large idi will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the dif if such a failure occurs the assessment base of a large idi is its total assets less tangible equity the volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds the statutory provision is commonly called the volcker rule the volcker rule does not significantly impact the operations of the company and the bank as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses prohibited by the volcker rule interchange fees the company is subject to rules governing interchange fees which establish standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions interchange fees or swipe fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions under applicable rules the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than  plus basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions the federal reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements required by the federal reserve the federal reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product incentive compensation the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulators and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities including us and the bank having at least billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity in addition these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentivebased compensation arrangements in june the federal reserve and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors during the second quarter of the us financial regulators including the federal reserve and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets but these proposed rules have not been finalized the federal reserve will review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as us that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies table of contents in october the sec adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations including nasdaq to require policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period the excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentivebased compensation been determined using the restated financials the final rule requires the exchanges to propose conforming listing standards by february and requires the standards to become effective no later than november each listed issuer which includes the company as a listed issuer on nasdaq would then be required to adopt a clawback policy within days after its exchanges listing standard has become effective the company will work to implement these new requirements as the rule becomes effective proposed legislation proposed legislation relating to the banking industry is introduced in almost every legislative session certain of such legislation could dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry we cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted or if it is adopted how it would affect the business of columbia bank or the company recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in a greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business effects of government monetary policy our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government particularly the federal reserve the federal reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession but its open market operations in us government securities control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the federal reserve and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits influence the growth of bank loans investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty table of contents
