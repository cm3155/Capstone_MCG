item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will adversely affect assets liabilities capital income and expenses at different times or in different amounts generally there are four sources of interest rate risk as described below repricing risk repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institutions assets and liabilities basis risk basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity yield curve risk yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument option risk in banking option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits withdrawals and early redemptions option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right but not the obligation to alter the quantity or the timing of cash flows option risk is also present in the investment portfolio as mortgagebacked securities could prepay or callable bonds could be called an assetliability management committee is responsible for developing monitoring and reviewing assetliability processes interest rate risk exposures strategies and tactics and reporting to the board of directors it is the responsibility of the board of directors to establish policies and interest rate limits and approve these policies and interest rate limits annually it is the responsibility of management to execute the approved policies develop and implement risk management strategies and to report to the board of directors on a regular basis we maintain an assetliability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk the policy guidelines direct management to assess the impact of changes in interest rates upon both earnings and capital the guidelines establish limits for interest rate risk sensitivity interest rate risk sensitivity we use a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analysis an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates basic assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgagerelated assets cash flows and maturities of other investment securities loan and deposit volumes and pricing these assumptions are inherently subjective and may not be realized and as a result actual results will differ from our projections in addition variances in the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes overall market conditions including volumes and pricing changes in management strategies among other factors will also result in variances between the projected and actual results the following table summarizes the expected impact on net interest income over a one or two year period if interest rates gradually increased or decreased during the first year based on the results of the simulation model as of december table start year one year two change in basis points bps change in net interest income change in net interest income change in net interest income change in net interest income dollars in thousands table end the following table summarizes the expected impact on net interest income over a one or two year period if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased based on the results of the simulation model as of december table start year one year two change in basis points bps change in net interest income change in net interest income change in net interest income change in net interest income dollars in thousands table end table of contents the projections are based on the current interest rate environment and we assume our balance sheet remains constant during the next two years shortterm market interest rates are near historical lows loan interest rate indexes such as prime libor and sofr are near historical lows since we do not assume negative interest rates the downward repricing of these loans is more limited than during a higher interest rate environment our ability to reprice deposits downward is also limited given our low cost of funds the smaller change in net interest income in the gradual scenarios versus the shock scenarios is due to the ramp up period of the interest rate scenario growth in interest income in the gradual and shock rising rate scenarios is constrained by floating rate loans where the floor rate exceeds the fully indexed rate in year two of the rising rate scenarios net interest income increases as yields on new loan production and investment security purchases rise faster than funding costs the decrease in net interest income in the falling rate scenario is due to loan production and investment security purchases at rates lower than the existing portfolios combined with our inability to materially lower funding costs net interest income sensitivity excludes the amortization of premiums discounts and deferred fees on the existing loan portfolio although the amortization of the collar is included in loan interest income on january the company entered into an interest rate collar derivative transaction with a million notional based on 1month libor in october the collar was terminated and resulted in a million realized gain that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of deferred income taxes the gain will amortize into interest income through february which is in line with the initial term of the interest rate collar the gain will be amortized in this manner as long as the cash flows pertaining to the hedged item are expected to occur the analysis of an institutions interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk the table on the following page sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate gap of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities at december the amounts in the table are derived from our internal data and are based upon sec reporting formats therefore they may not be consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere herein that has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the estimates for net interest income sensitivity and interest rate gap could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions early withdrawal of deposits and competition for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates also the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while other types may lag changes in market interest rates additionally certain assets such as adjustablerate mortgages have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a shortterm basis and over the lives of such assets further in the event of a change in market interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables finally the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustablerate debt may decrease in the event of a substantial increase in market interest rates table of contents table start december

virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institutions performance than the effect of general levels of inflation although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates libor transition management has discontinued use of libor in new contracts including loans investment securities and interest rate derivatives current actions include the implementation of substitute language for legacy liborbased loans to transition to sofr before june when libor will no longer be an option for the company to use this is likely to require some additional costs and litigation risk may rise with contract renewals if needed we are in discussions with our counterparties and tracking industry developments to ensure a smooth transition for clients and competitive loan pricing please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report for further information regarding the interest rate derivatives as the fasb and the irs have proposed hedge accounting and taxation relief with regards to the transition the company does not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the transition away from libor table of contents
