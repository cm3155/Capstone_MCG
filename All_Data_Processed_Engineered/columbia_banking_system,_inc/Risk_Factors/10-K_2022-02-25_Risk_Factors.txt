item risk factors the following is a discussion of what we currently believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition and future results risks relating to our operations our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will negatively affect our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments including the emergence of new variances of covid19 and the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines over the long term and against new variants which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted while financial markets rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement during the second half of and in many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the covid19 pandemic persisted through the beginning of including i muted levels of business activity across many sectors of the economy weakened consumer confidence and disruptions to the global supply chain ii elevated levels of market volatility iii the federal funds rate and yields on us treasury securities near zero iv the exacerbation of recent inflationary trends v heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic and vi higher cyber security information security and operational risks as a result of workfromhome arrangements depending on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic going forward as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and corporate confidence the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity and certain authorities have indicated an intention or are under pressure to wind down certain of these measures to counter inflationary trends we also face an increased risk of client disputes litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on economic and market conditions the length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures that have been put in place to address it are unknown for example the omicron variant of covid19 has led to a spike in covid19 cases across the united states has led to travel and other disruptions and certain governmental authorities and other third parties have reimposed restrictions in order to respond to the rise in cases attributable to the omicron variant of covid19 until the pandemic subsides we may experience draws on lines of credit reduced revenues in our wealth management businesses and increased client defaults including defaults in unsecured loans even after the pandemic subsides the us economy as well as most other major economies may continue to experience a recession and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the us and other major markets further the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section or in the risk factors section of any subsequent quarterly report on printing and mailing of a joint proxy statementprospectus in connection with the merger and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger if the merger is not completed columbia would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger table of contents combining columbia and umpqua may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and columbia may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of columbia and umpqua to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger columbia and umpqua must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth if columbia and umpqua are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues levels of expenses and operating results of the combined company following the completion of the merger which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger columbia and umpqua have operated and until the completion of the merger must continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on columbia during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company furthermore the board of directors and executive leadership of the combined company will consist of former directors and executive officers from each of columbia and umpqua combining the boards of directors and management teams of each company into a single board and a single management team could require the reconciliation of differing priorities and philosophies the combined company may be unable to retain columbia andor umpqua personnel successfully after the merger is completed the success of the merger will depend in part on the combined companys ability to retain the talent and dedication of key employees currently employed by columbia and umpqua it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with columbia or umpqua as applicable while the merger is pending or with the combined company after the merger is consummated if columbia and umpqua are unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies columbia and umpqua could face disruptions in their operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs in addition following the merger if key employees terminate their employment the combined companys business activities may be adversely affected and managements attention may be diverted from successfully hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause the combined companys business to suffer columbia and umpqua also may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company columbia will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger with umpqua is pending uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on columbia these uncertainties may impair columbias ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with columbia to seek to change existing business relationships with columbia in addition subject to certain exceptions columbia has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on a timely basis without the consent of umpqua these restrictions may prevent columbia from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger columbia has incurred and is expected to incur substantial costs related to the merger and integration columbia has incurred and expects to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the merger these costs include legal financial advisory accounting consulting and other advisory fees retention severance and employee benefitrelated costs public company filing fees and other regulatory fees financial printing and other printing costs closing integration and other related costs some of these costs are payable by columbia regardless of whether or not the merger is completed table of contents shareholder litigation related to the merger with umpqua could prevent or delay the completion of the merger result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of columbia shareholders have brought claims in connection with the proposed merger and among other remedies seek damages and an injunction preventing the merger from closing if any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting columbia or umpqua from completing the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in costs to columbia including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger further such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of columbia the merger agreement between the company and umpqua may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed the merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger those conditions include among other things i approval by each of the columbia shareholders and the umpqua shareholders of certain matters relating to the merger at each companys respective special meeting which approvals were obtained on january ii the receipt of required regulatory approvals including the approval of the frb and the fdic and iii the absence of any order injunction decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or making the completion of the merger the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement illegal each partys obligation to complete the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions including a subject to applicable materiality standards the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party b the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement and c the receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code of these conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the merger may not be completed in addition the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time before or after the requisite shareholder approvals or umpqua or columbia may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances our assumptions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans if our assumptions are incorrect significant earnings volatility can occur and credit loss provisions may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio any increase in future loan losses could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under acquisition accounting if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets the excess is carried on the acquirers balance sheet as goodwill in accordance with gaap our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists such evaluation may be based on a variety of factors including the quoted price of our common stock market prices of common stock of other banking organizations common stock trading multiples dcf analysis and data from comparable acquisitions future evaluations of goodwill may result in impairment and ensuing writedowns which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity table of contents we may not be able to attract or retain key employees our success depends in significant part on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees we expect our future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with our clients by our executives and other key employees leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations or other departures will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase we need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business the unexpected loss of any such employees or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the scope and content of us banking regulators regulations and policies on incentive compensation as well as changes to these regulations and policies could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate our key employees our ability to sustain or improve upon existing performance is dependent upon our ability to respond to technological change and we may have fewer resources than some of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers in addition the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased dependency on technology significant legal or regulatory actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations claims and legal actions including supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities could involve large monetary claims including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and significant defense costs to mitigate the cost of some of these claims we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations however our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that might be brought against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost as a result we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities which could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could cause significant reputational harm to us andor could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects because we primarily serve individuals and businesses located in the northwest any negative impact resulting from reputational harm including any impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees likely would be greater than if our business were more geographically diverse we are subject to a variety of operational risks including reputational risk legal risk and compliance risk and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we are exposed to many types of operational risks including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems these risks have increased in light of workfromhome arrangements implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel whether or not accurate or true that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels in particular social media may magnify risks relating to negative publicity table of contents if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect we are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets that can give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that we or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners service providers and other third parties we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our clients or otherwise act as partners in our business activities in a variety of ways including through the provision of key components of our business infrastructure we expect these third parties to perform services for us fulfill their obligations to us accurately inform us of relevant information and conduct their activities in a manner that reflects positively on our brand and business although we manage exposure to such thirdparty risk through a variety of means including the performance of due diligence and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective any failure of our business partners service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational disruptions increased expenditures regulatory actions in which we may be held responsible for the actions of third parties damage to our reputation and the loss of clients which in turn could harm our business and operations strategic growth objectives and financial performance because of the covid19 pandemic many of our counterparties and thirdparty service providers have been and may further be affected by stayathome orders market volatility and other factors that increase their risk of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services our thirdparty partners may also rely on their own business partners and service providers in the ordinary course of their business although we seek to diversify our exposure to thirdparty partners in order to increase our resiliency we are nevertheless exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us which in turn could harm our business and operations strategic growth objectives and financial performance failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may adversely affect our business and results of operations management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks any system of controls and procedures however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls are not insured against or are in excess of our insurance limits any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents interest rate and credit risks economic conditions in the market areas we serve may adversely impact our earnings and could increase our credit risk associated with our loan portfolio the value of our investment portfolio and the availability of deposits substantially all of our loan and deposit customers are businesses and individuals in washington oregon idaho and california and soft economies in these market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a deterioration in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects loan delinquencies may increase problem assets and foreclosures may increase collateral for loans made may decline in value in turn reducing customers borrowing power reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans certain securities within our investment portfolio could require an allowance for credit losses requiring a writedown through earnings to fair value thereby reducing equity lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits may decrease and demand for our loan and other products and services may decrease concentrations within our loan portfolio could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy while our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors it is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans these types of loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments in fact the fdic has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about heavy loan concentrations because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate and commercial business loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan losses or an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate deterioration in the real estate market or other segments of our loan portfolio would lead to additional losses as of december of our total gross loans were secured by real estate any renewed downturn in the economies or real estate values in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on both borrowers ability to repay their loans and the value of the real property securing such loans our ability to recover on defaulted loans would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans any or all of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses which could adversely affect earnings we maintain an allowance for credit losses for periods prior to january referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio while we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified additionally the process for determining the allowance requires different subjective and complex judgments about the future impact from current economic conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans as a result future significant increases to the allowance may be necessary future increases to the allowance may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising the portfolio deteriorating values in underlying collateral most of which consists of real estate and changes in the financial condition of borrowers such as may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of actual future events differing from assumptions used by management in determining the allowance we adopted asu no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments effective january this standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit this standard changed the prior incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses and adoption of the new standard required us to increase our allowance and greatly increased the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance table of contents additionally banking regulators as an integral part of their supervisory function periodically review our allowance these regulatory agencies may require us to increase the allowance any increase in the allowance would have an adverse effect which could be material on our financial condition and results of operations nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans thereby adversely affecting our income moreover nonaccrual loans increase our loan administration costs assets acquired by foreclosure or similar proceedings are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell the valuation of these foreclosed assets is periodically updated and resulting losses if any are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified an increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks we utilize various techniques such as loan sales workouts and restructurings to manage our problem assets decreases in the value of these problem assets the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial condition would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff which can be detrimental to performance of their other responsibilities we may experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business significant increases in market interest rates on loans or the perception that an increase may occur could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow conversely decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments an increase in market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floatingrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge offs which could adversely affect our business further our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income which is the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans securities and other interestearning assets and the interest paid on deposits borrowings and other interestbearing liabilities because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities accordingly fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and in turn our profitability although it is expected that the federal reserve will increase the target federal funds rate in to combat recent inflationary trends if interest rates do not rise or if the federal reserve were to lower the target federal funds rate to below these low rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts on the other hand increases in interest rates to combat inflation or otherwise may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interestbearing accounts we are unable to predict changes in interest rates which are affected by factors beyond our control including inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other changes in financial markets interest rates on certain of our outstanding financial instruments are subject to change based on regulatory developments which could adversely affect our revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments libor and certain other benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after the united kingdoms financial conduct authority and the benchmark administrator for the us dollar libor have announced that the publication of the most commonly used us dollar libor settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after june the us federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the us dollar libor as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december we may be adversely impacted by the changes involving libor and other benchmark rates as a result of our business activities and our underlying operations and interest rates on our loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments may be adversely affected table of contents regulators industry groups and certain committees eg the alternative reference rates committee have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates eg the sofr as the recommended alternative to us dollar libor and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments however the introduction of and adoption of successor rates had been slow until late there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of libor transition including with respect to the acceptance and use of sofr or other alternative benchmark rates the characteristics of these new rates are not identical to the benchmarks they seek to replace will not produce the exact economic equivalent as those benchmarks and may perform differently in a variety of market conditions compared to those benchmarks for example during the covid19 pandemic period there has been more volatility in relation to sofr as compared to libor the sofr markets have not yet developed into robust markets which may present continuing risks as the june cessation date approaches at this time it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk the operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans if any may not be sufficient to ensure repayment in addition there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers in order to successfully manage credit risk we must among other things maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards the weakening of these standards for any reason such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio may result in loan defaults foreclosures and additional chargeoffs and may necessitate that we increase our acl each of which could adversely affect our net income as a result our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may be required in the future to recognize a credit loss with respect to investment securities our securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses as of december gross unrealized losses in our securities portfolio were million we may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities securities issued by certain states and municipalities may come under scrutiny due to concerns about credit quality although management believes the credit quality of the companys state and municipal securities portfolio to be good there can be no assurance that the credit quality of these securities will not decline in the future we evaluate the securities portfolio for any securities with an associated credit loss each reporting period as required by gaap in the united states there can be no assurance however that future evaluations of the securities portfolio will not require us to recognize credit losses with respect to these and other holdings for example it is possible that governmentsponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgagebacked securities since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities we are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities in connection with real properties acquired during the ordinary course of business we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if previously unknown or undisclosed hazardous or toxic substances are discovered we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses which may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement polices with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review at the time of underwriting a loan secured by real property and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations table of contents funding and liquidity risks our management of capital could adversely affect profitability measures and the market price of our common stock and could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock our capital ratios are significantly higher than regulatory minimums we may lower our capital ratios through selective acquisitions that meet our disciplined criteria share repurchase plans organic loan growth investment in securities or a combination of all four we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our business through strategic acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate future acquisitions on terms acceptable to us conversely there may be circumstances under which it would be prudent to consider alternatives for raising capital to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities or in response to changing economic conditions in addition we may need to raise additional capital in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly we may not be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at the time which are outside our control and our financial performance further if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition any capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock conditions in the financial markets may limit access to additional funding to meet liquidity needs we may need or want to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly our ability to raise additional capital will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside of our control and our financial performance economic conditions and any loss of confidence in financial institutions generally may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital there can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of equity or debt purchasers or counterparties participating in capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and potentially our liquidity also if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal accounting and compliance risks we operate in a highly regulated environment and changes to or increases in or supervisory enforcement of banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities in addition as a publiclytraded company we are subject to regulation by the sec any change in applicable regulations or federal state or local legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement income tax laws and accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations for example the doddfrank act was enacted in july among other provisions the legislation i created the cfpb with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages ii resulted in new capital requirements from federal banking agencies iii placed new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees and iv required the sec and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms some of which have yet to be promulgated the doddfrank act and regulations that have been adopted thereunder have increased the overall costs of regulatory compliance and further regulatory developments whether related to doddfrank or otherwise may lead to additional costs in addition the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority and is the principal federal regulatory agency responsible for the supervision and enforcement of a wide range of consumer protection laws for banks with greater than billion in assets table of contents if we fail to maintain appropriate levels of capital or liquidity we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions that may impose restrictions on our business including limiting our lending activities or our ability to expand requiring us to raise additional capital which may be dilutive to shareholders or requiring regulatory approval to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders we also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modifications of existing regulations which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our business or profitability further regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties the exercise of regulatory authority may have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects additionally our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the us federal government and its agencies including the federal reserve

our market areas could adversely affect us commercial banking is a highly competitive business we compete with other commercial banks savings and loan associations credit unions and finance insurance and other nondepository companies operating in our market areas we also experience competition especially for deposits from internetbased banking institutions which have grown rapidly in recent years we are subject to substantial competition for loans and deposits from other financial institutions some of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction as we are andor have greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may have liquidity issues which could impact the pricing of deposits loans and other financial products in our markets our

adversely affect our business affect client activity levels and damage our reputation concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts consumers and businesses are also changing their behavior and business preferences as a result of these concerns new governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change as well as changes in consumers and businesses behaviors and business preferences may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services the governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements in connection with the transition to a low carbon economy legislative or public policy changes and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients which may decrease revenues from those clients and table of contents increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients our business reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes tsunamis floods fires and other natural catastrophic events a major catastrophe such as an earthquake tsunami flood fire or other natural disaster including those caused or exacerbated by climate change could result in a prolonged interruption of our business for example our headquarters are located in tacoma washington and we have operations throughout the northwest a geographical region that has been or may be affected by earthquakes wildfires tsunamis and flooding activity and in northern california a geographical region that has been and continues to be affected by earthquakes and wildfires because we primarily serve individuals and businesses in the northwest and northern california a natural disaster likely would have a greater impact on our business operations and financial condition than if our business were more geographically diverse the occurrence of any of these natural disasters could negatively impact our performance by disrupting our operations or the operations of our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows risks relating to investment in our stock there can be no assurance as to the level of dividends we may pay on our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and there may be circumstances under which we would eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we rely on dividends and other payments from our bank for substantially all of our revenue we are a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank and we receive substantially all of our operating cash flows from dividends and other payments from the bank these dividends and payments are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our capital stock and interest and principal on any debt we may have various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have various antitakeover measures that could impede a takeover our articles of incorporation include certain provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest merger or otherwise these provisions include certain nonmonetary factors that our board of directors may consider when evaluating a takeover offer and a requirement that any business combination be approved by the affirmative vote of no less than of the total shares attributable to persons other than a control person these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a tender offer proxy contest or otherwise and may deter any potentially hostile offers or other efforts to obtain control of us this could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium for their columbia common stock even in circumstances where such action is favored by a majority of our shareholders
