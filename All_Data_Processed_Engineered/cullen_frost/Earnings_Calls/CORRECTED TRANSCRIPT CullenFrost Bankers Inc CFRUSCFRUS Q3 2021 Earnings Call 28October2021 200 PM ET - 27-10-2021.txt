with million or per share in the second quarter we continue to focus on our organic strategy while the economy works to move past supply chain issues and other lingering effects of the pandemic average deposits continued their strong increase in the third quarter and were billion an increase of compared with billion in the third quarter of last year overall average loans in the third quarter were billion compared with billion in the third quarter of but this included the impact of ppp loans excluding ppp loans third quarter average loans of billion were essentially flat from a year ago but up an annualized on a linked quarter basis and looking forward were very encouraged about the outlook for loan growth new loan commitments booked through the third quarter excluding ppp loans were up by compared to the first nine months of last year for the quarter new loan commitments were up by on a linked quarter basis we were especially pleased that the linked quarter increase was due primarily to ci commitments which were up our current weighted pipeline is higher than one year ago and higher than last quarter the increases are in both ci up and cre up the market continues to be very competitive in the third quarter of the deals we lost were due to structure compared to in the quarter before we also continue to add to our commercial customer base and we recorded new commercial relationships during the quarter while this was down from the same quarter a year ago when we were experiencing incredible ppp success it is twothirds higher than the quarter immediately before the ppp program as with the second quarter we did not report a credit loss expense in the third quarter our asset quality outlook is stable and in general problem assets are declining in number new problems have dropped to prepandemic levels net chargeoffs for the third quarter totaled million compared with million in the second quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the third quarter were basis points of average loans nonaccrual loans were million at the end of the third quarter a slight decrease from the million at the end of the second quarter overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were million or basis points of periodend loans and these were manageable prepandemic levels what started out as billion in 90day deferrals granted to borrowers early in the pandemic were completely gone as of the end of the third quarter so the problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were down slightly to million at the end of the third quarter compared with million at the end of the second quarter in the third quarter we continued making progress toward our goal of midsingledigit concentration level in the energy portfolio over time with energy loans falling to of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the quarter our teams continue to analyze the nonenergy portfolio segments that we considered the most at risk from pandemic impacts as of the third quarter those segments are represented by restaurants hotels and entertainment and sports the total of these portfolio segments excluding ppp loans represented million at the end of the third quarter and our loan loss reserve for these segments was the credit quality of individual credits in these segments is currently mostly stable or better compared to the end of the second quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 we reported in the second quarter that we had completed our branch houston expansion initiative and were very pleased with the results weve identified eight more locations to open in the coming months and that process is underway let me update you where we stand through the third quarter with the houston expansion excluding ppp loans our numbers of new households were of target and represented more than new individuals and businesses our loan volumes were of target and represented million in outstandings and about of this represents commercial credits with about consumer deposits surpassed billion and were of target commercial deposits accounted for twothirds of the total in the meantime were also preparing for our upcoming branch expansion project in the dallas region which will kick off with the first new financial center opening early next year and continuing into the dallas expansion will follow our houston model and we will employ the lessons learned during our teams successful rollout ill continue to emphasize that the business were generating through our expansion strategy is consistent with the overall company its profitability is weighted towards small and midsize businesses but it also is complemented by wealth management insurance and of course consumer banking which continues to see tremendous growth for example through the first six months of this year we had already surpassed consumer bankings alltime annual growth for new customer relationships which was in at the end of the third quarter of this year this had risen to net new checking customers thats already more than of our previous annual record weve worked hard to lower barriers to entry for potential customers with improved product offerings and physical distribution for example besides overdraft grace which we introduced in april and early payday which we announced in july we also recently established an atm branding partnership with cardtronics that resulted in us having by far the largest atm network in the state in addition after over two years of study weve begun the process of putting in place the infrastructure to add residential mortgages to our suite of consumer real estate products in late this will complement our portfolio currently consisting of home equity heloc home improvement and purchase money second loans which has steadily grown to in excess of billion utilizing bestinclass technology will allow us to provide frost level of worldclass customer service as we build this portfolio over time in response to customer demand finally i want to commend our team working on ppp loans nearly of the loans ph for billion have already been helped through the loan forgiveness process that includes upwards of of the first round loans from our team continues to put in outstanding work to execute our strategies whether its ppp our expansion projects or the enhancements weve made through our customer experience and id like to thank everyone at frost i believe weve got the best team in the financial services industry they are why i continue to be optimistic about our company and our prospects for success now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was down basis points from reported last quarter the decrease was primarily the result of a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 higher proportion of earning assets being invested in loweryielding balances at the fed in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and to a lesser extent the impact of a lower ppp loan volumes and their related yields compared to the prior quarter interestbearing deposits at the fed averaged billion or about of our average earning assets in the third quarter up from billion or of average earning assets in the prior quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans our net interest margin percentage would have been in the third quarter down from an adjusted for the second quarter with all of the decrease resulting from the higher level of balances at the fed in the third quarter the taxable equivalent loan yield for the third quarter was down basis points from the previous quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been down basis points from the prior quarter to add some additional color on our ppp loans total ppp loans at the end of september were million down from billion at the end of june forgiveness payments received during the third quarter were higher than we had projected resulting in an acceleration in the recognition of the net deferred fees during the quarter at the end of the third quarter we had only about million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized and we currently expect about of that to be recognized in the fourth quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter up about million from the second quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the third quarter down basis point from the second quarter the yield on the taxable portfolio which averaged billion was up basis points from the second quarter our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the third quarter up million from the second quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of down five basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the third quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was years up slightly from years in the second quarter we made investment purchases towards the end of september of approximately billion consisting of about million in mbs agency securities with a yield of about about million in treasuries yielding with the remainder in municipal securities regarding noninterest expense looking at the full year we currently expect an annual expense growth rate of around over our total reported noninterest expenses which is consistent with our previous guidance regarding the estimates for full year earnings given our third quarter results and the recognition of lower ppp fee accretion for the fourth quarter we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of is reasonable with that ill turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry okay well open it up for questions now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well i just wanted to start with mortgage i remember you guys got out of the mortgage business i think its been a couple of decades ago and now youre getting back in and maybe just two things ph here is this an originate and sell model or is this an originate and keep it across model and then if its originate and sell how big of an investment do you think youre going to make like will this be a meaningful fee income contributor phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady actually this is going to be a it will not be a sell model were wanting to do this to expand relationships and its our intention to keep all these books on the keep all these loans on the balance sheet so it wont be really a feebased model its going to be more of a portfolio model well be in charge of the experience from beginning to end including servicing and as i said its our objective to make this a worldclass customer experience that people have with our general products and in addition which is what we have with our current consumer real estate products that i mentioned in my comments earlier which include home equity home equity line of credit purchase money seconds and home improvement so im really excited about this opportunity and i think its important because i realize we were the poster child for getting out of the mortgage business before the meltdown but i think its important to realize what were doing and what were not doing what were not doing is going back into essentially the model that we had utilized before which was very consistent with what was out there which was a commissionbased sales structure and one where technology ph and size were so important in order to achieve scale with the technology at that time what were doing today is this will be frost bankers providing this service and really its in response to customer demand itll be done through our branch network which as you know is expanding significantly these days into major significant markets in the state cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 and were going to and i think really importantly and this is a differentiator between where we were years ago is the technology thats available today is much more accessible its much more scalable at an appropriate level theres a lower cost to entry and a lower cost to support as we use cloud and saas technology providers so its mainly about providing a great customer experience in this sector and i believe weve got a great opportunity brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and phil how big would you like resi mortgage to be over time like as a percent of total loans at frost phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc our consumer real estate today runs about billion so its a little below of the portfolio i think pound for pound residential mortgage could be at least that size in the next five years and i would think it has a chance to be bigger than that that wont take a tremendous amount of volume frankly i think if we got less than a little bit less than two loans per month for our branches that would be a good target for us to shoot for and in the markets that were in that will give us some pretty good volume over time brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then my second question is just more about deploying cash into the bond book i mean the pile of cash you guys are sitting on just keeps growing its now of average earning assets weve seen the long end of the curve move a little bit from days ph ago and the 10year bond yield is now at almost basis point so how do you think about the timing on when you start putting more of this cash to use in the bond portfolio jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well brady just for some perspective right now really as we look out into the fourth quarter i only see projections for say another billion being spent this year so we did billion in september i see us maybe doing another billion were not going to get rushed into it obviously ph were we spend a lot of time looking at whats out in the marketplace looking at those yields just as youve discussed and we really like the optionality that we have were not going to be rushed into something so i dont think weve got a timeframe in mind to do that obviously if the yields turn our way well jump in but were not in a rush to do that i think that if we feel like when the right time comes well jump in were not afraid to make purchases we just dont feel like its the right time right now given the current environment brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great thanks guys cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just one followup jerry on the ppp fees sorry if i missed it what was the ppp fees in the third headquarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc the fee itself or you want all the interest income the fee ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so the total interest income associated with ppp loans was million ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc million jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc that was down from million in the second quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc million and you mentioned that theres million to go plus whatever the on the rest of the loan balances cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc correct ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood so if i ph ex out the million and i would be about whatever for the third quarter around ph basis points is that a good base like do you think nii should grow from there jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc youre talking about help me ebrahim are you talking about net interest income or ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah net interest income when you look at it from an exppp basis should has that troughed jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah let me get that let me kind of look at my information here yeah so i think on a nonppp basis in the third quarter i think that if you take that id say that really again with the purchases we made we made late in the third quarter so you need to take that into account but yeah that run rate i would say is really kind of the bottom if you will well get a little bit of that ppp in the fourth quarter but if you pull that out i think from here on i mean you heard phil talk about the loan growth that weve had in the fourth in the third quarter the pipeline looks good and then we mentioned i mentioned that we made some purchases in september that we really didnt feel the impact of it in the third quarter so yeah from the way i look at it hopefully that was the bottom as far as net interest income dollars ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just going back to the mortgage conversation earlier phil so you announced the partnership with blend i think in the middle of october just talk to us one is there more to it beyond mortgage in terms of what you think that partnership does for you on the consumer side and what else are you looking at like youve been a little bit ahead of the pack in terms of either reacting or staying afoot on overdraft fees on early sort of payment for a pay loan payments for employment checks just give us a sense of what to make what we should make of the blend partnership and what else are you looking at when you think about fintech partnerships phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well blend has been a product that we have been utilizing for i know its been well over a year and it was pre covid so this is an expansion of that and id say also ibrahim as we look at the other segments youve got the application and the decisioning and then the servicing piece were looking at bestinclass software for all three of those segments and it could be that those last two could be one provider it could be two providers and so its i think its exciting because its not often in this business that you get to really chose the technology you want for a strategy and where you dont have a legacy system involved that youve got to work off of so it gives cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 us the ability along with the work were doing with infosys to create the best workflow and the best customer experience with the best software and what i think were going to see happen is it will take the software that weve utilized for the mortgage experience in the mortgage product and well see that reengineered into our workflow that we currently do for that large portfolio of consumer real estate so i think there are some real advantages that we can look forward to getting in this ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just one more if i could like you sounded pretty upbeat on the outlook for loan growth just give us a sense of is that growth based on optimism that things start easing on the supply chain and customer sentiment improves or are you actually seeing tangible signs of activity levels picking up where you ph do feel like fourth quarter and at least first half of next year ph should pretty good loan growth wise phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc in talking with people theyre optimistic i mean a couple of additional things our ph look to book ratio has been i think pretty good ph versus a year ago our numbers on looks up and our bookings are up so its good to see that those are consistent with each other one thing to keep in mind is as we continue to adjust the energy portfolio and you look at that linked quarter increase which was not annualized for new commitments booked that included a reduction in energy commitments booked so little still a little headway there as we rationalize that portfolio where we want to be still in the midsingle digits still an important portfolio but as you know weve been working down our concentration there and then i think another thing is that i look at is if you look at our and i mentioned this our pipeline essentially lets call it 90day outlook and the weighted pipeline as i said it was about over last year up on a linkedquarter basis that weighted pipeline is what our people expect to happen so it tells me that theyre somewhat optimistic on our on what were going to actually be able to execute there so ill say another thing as ive looked at just utilization under lines of credit weve seen that pick up particularly in the commercial business i think it hit a low point in may utilization on working capital lines this is for ci was about at the end of the third quarter i think that was pretty much even so were seeing that contribute to some volumes and i think well because weve had some good execution on commercial real estate recently were sort of early in the game on those projects and as they mature i think well see some funding up on that so just the sense since we ph get that thats really indicative of what weve been experiencing over the last several months as opposed to people expecting supply chains to get better ph as that has been because frankly i dont think the supply chains are getting any better and labor is not any better so to see this in that environment was encouraging ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc ph all right thats helpful color thanks for taking my questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning ph or good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc ph hey jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc phil you said youre going to indiscernible lessons learned from the houston expansion with the future branch adds in dallas and the rest of them in houston can you just talk about what you have learned over the past two or three years with this branch expansion phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i dont want to give away all the secret sauce but how about this its all about people right its all about getting the right people and getting them early enough ph that before you open up these locations to get them engaged with the market and make sure that youre bringing in people that really believe in the culture of the company and what were trying to do as ive said before we havent done and dont do teams of people we do individuals who are making a decision that frost is the right place for them to be and i think its really the success of our houston strategy is ph really related to having great focus and commitment of resources on our part of really talented individuals to lead that effort and then selecting the right people that have really executed to create these results and thats what its got to be so i will say its a little probably a little tougher market than it was when we started houston three years ago because some of the supply chain stuff some of the cost stuff people are not getting any easier to hire but i think weve had pretty good results thus far so but i think we can and we are utilizing the same procedures in the company and the same focus that we did in houston lets just say that and im very confident of our ability to execute that plan jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc ph okay and can we just talk about someone asked before about the excess liquidity how long do you think its going to take to deploy cullens excess liquidity you guys have a lot more than most of your peers jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah what id say jennifer is number one we typically have more liquidity than most and obviously were not going to carry of our earning assets in cash but let me give that sort of backdrop that we do tend to keep a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 little bit higher level were not going to ill say that we wont jump in all at once i think that itll take most of to make a major dent in it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jennifer the loantodeposit ratio where it is hovering around thats kind of where we were at the last low point historically for our company when you look at what it took to get to a lets say an high i mean that was a extended period i think whenever we saw the last decline in loantodeposit ratio ph was into the and that was in the great recession i think it took us five years to get back to a for us a more normalized number i think its i mean honestly i think its going to be at least that for us because one thing is and as ive always said this this is a highclass problem because if youre doing youre doing job growing deposits youve got plenty of liquidity plenty of dry powder and youre able to generate funding at a really good competitive cost because you can generate so much demand deposits which are very low cost so im not so much worried about utilization of liquidity per se as i am just about making sure that our loan growth is solid our new relationship growth is solid and our strategies for organic growth are being successful i think the earnings will take care of itself and then well be opportunistic as youve seen us be on when we employ that liquidity into the bond market or frankly if we dont employ into the bond market i mean frankly the optionality that jerry talks about i think becomes increasingly important as we see what happens with inflation and not just supply chain but what were seeing with labor cost and i tend to think that the ph short end is going to have more volatility than the long end over the next year or so its my opinion but weve got the opportunity to take a look and see on that jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good afternoon this is anthony elian on for steve phil you mentioned that youve had close to net new checking accounts added so far this year are you able to parse out how much of these new customers are choosing frost because of services you offer including early payday and overdraft grace that not many banks offer phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i cant tell you that i cant tell you that because they dont tell us why theyre joining us i can tell you though that early payday was ph obviously july the big overdraft grace in april and so we broke the record for our alltime annual number in june so youd have basically seen no impact there for early payday and pretty limited impact from overdraft grace i think one of the things thats really helping us aside from just reputationally what our service and net promoter scores tells us about how people think about us is i mean the houston expansion strategy has been a really big contributor to growth and so theres that and they are really helping us see increases there and then secondly cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 weve done a great job of developing our capability and marketing for online i think of the accounts that weve opened this year have been opened online so doing a good job in both those areas in the digital side and then expanding on the physical side and the geographic distribution both of those things i think it really helped us get to a new level in terms of consumer growth anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and then my followup you mentioned in the prepared remarks you plan to open eight more houston locations in the coming months any more details you can provide on this in terms of the expense run rate beyond as you build these branches thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc what id say to that is i think weve kind of given a little bit of this guidance before we do have our planned dallas expansion that phil talked about and then also our expanding on the locations in houston that weve already opened and the guidance that we gave originally when we announced the houston plan was that it was going to cost us about in the first year and thats really based on what im looking at i think were going to be pretty close to that right now given what were looking at obviously some of that will be dependent on the timing of the locations the hiring of the people et cetera but i think youd be pretty close about something a in anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and also i guess ill mention i think your comment mentioned that we do houston all in a year and those will come over a twoyear period and dallas will be a twoandahalf year period so those will be coming in over a period of time operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey phil one of your comments earlier about the competitive environment and loss to structure versus in the prior quarter whats changed and do you expect competition to get even tougher from here phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i was talking to our people last week about what theyre seeing its as id say largely the same thing ph burn down rates guarantees terms loan to cost et cetera the one thing that was a little different that theyd seen on the permanent side was that a trend towards again these are permanent deals interestonly deals for five and years which is sort of new havent seen as much of it so i think that around the margins around the edges it continues to be more competitive there was one i remember they told me about one person who was putting together a deal i guess they were a broker for a permanent deal for a customer and they had said that i dont know what else i can ask for theyve said yes to everything so i mean that just tells you how accommodative the markets have been all that said though our people are optimistic about our ability to get deals and we have great relationships with key customers and so youd think that thered be more pessimism as you see this thing get more competitive but i think just and well we know ph what to compete on when and yet still keep our disciplines but we seem to be doing okay jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah the new commercial relationship numbers are certainly good and same with consumer as well and i guess thats what you control right ph this activity phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc exactly jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah and i guess back on the loan to deposit question i know its not the most critical ratio out there but it seems to me that maybe the excessive deposit growth is starting to abate a bit and youre seeing a bottoming in loans and perhaps over the next couple of quarters that starts to reverse itself and climb back up again is that a fair way to think about it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that certainly deposit growth was a little bit softer in the third quarter it was still on an annualized basis so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its still strong but its not the singledouble digits that weve been seeing the high teens so from that standpoint youre right i mean if anything at that level with loan growth continuing or starting to improve now that that number could get better but at the end of the day were all about relationships as phil said and those deposits keep coming in we want them right and so to the extent that that those deposits picked up again wed certainly be happy about that so i think theoretically youre right if deposit growth slows down and loan picks up yeah thatll kind of take care of itself but were still adding new locations we continue to offer top quality service were still interested in opening new accounts when i look at a month rollback looking backwards about where our growth came from in a rolling months on the deposit side of it was augmentation from our existing customers and of it was from new customers and thats a little bit higher that weve been seeing weve seen seeing like a so its good to see that so ph yeah i think youre right but wed love to continue to see deposits growing jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah that was one of my next questions i guess that split is i was curious on that and i guess the last one phil you touched on it in your very early comments about houston when you were giving some of the numbers but youd touched on the fee businesses can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing in from the new branches in terms of the fees and fee generation phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc jon honestly i dont have that breakdown with me in terms of that for the expansion branches i can tell you in the last year we talked a little bit about fee income weve really had a nice year at this point in wealth management and wealth advisors ph got a little bit tougher in the insurance but still holding our own there jerry you want to talk a little bit about the noninterest jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think phil mentioned we thought i thought we had a pretty solid quarter on the noninterest income side the trust side of the business had some good growth there and with the investment fees growing i think and then good oil and gas revenues there obviously with the higher commodity prices thats helping us compared to where we were say in the third quarter last year and they continue to have new account growth there so good growth there i think on the deposit service charges even with overdraft grace i think that nsfod combined commercial and consumer might have been down compared to the third quarter a year ago but we did see good growth on the commercial service charges with higher billable services and interchange fee i thought was really strong we were up almost million and we had introduced a new commercial account thats responsible for about half of that but its also interesting that were seeing the numbers of transactions debit card usage is obviously going up significantly and the dollar size of the transactions that are running through are also up so i thats how we had a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 good solid quarter all the way around a lot of customer derivative activity also in the other category so yeah i think overall it was a good quarter a little bit of softer on the insurance side as phil said weve been fighting a little bit of an uphill battle there on the net new customer business there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay great thanks for all the help jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thank you just a couple of questions on expenses i heard you guys say you still expect expenses to be at for the year i guess what kind of range are you putting around that because if i actually put in exactly it does apply or it does imply a very sizable increase in fourth quarter expenses ph of just over million i just want to make sure im thinking about that right jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah ph no i think its a fair question ken i was looking at it this morning and the one thing id point you to is our historical growth between third and fourth quarters when you go back and look last year its not too different than that we do have some incentives that some incentive awards that get awarded in the fourth quarter some of them because of the nature of the award and the age of the recipient get recognized immediately and so thats going to have those awards will happen in october and so thats going to affect salaries in the fourth quarter and then also marketing historically weve been strong in marketing expense in the fourth quarter and i expect that well see that as well so yeah i agree with you when i the numbers do look high but if you look at our history and look at what where our projections are at i think were right in there would i love for it to be lower than that sure but i think right now based on what im seeing thats really where were at and i think those two things its really that salaries category and the other expense category where im seeing most of the pressure ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay thanks and then just the sort of a followup back to expenses i appreciate the totally makes sense but what is the base i mean should we assume lets say the whatever the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 growth happens in and then we grow another on top of that and then we add im just trying to make sure i know what were talking about jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah sure yeah well obviously were not giving any sort of guidance were still in that planning process theres lot of work going on there i will say that phil alluded to a little bit about the inflation that were seeing out there we are starting to see continue to see wage inflation i was looking at something from the dallas fed this morning if i could put my hands on it it was just interesting a couple of the comments that they were making about the texas economy and it said lack of applicants still top hiring constraint but pay demands are an increasing concern and then there was another bullet point that said average hourly wage is now rising faster in texas than the us so we are dealing with that environment but we are in the planning stages so dont hear me saying anything about what our guidance is for expenses but youre right yeah whatever base level you believe youd start off with on im suggesting that the houston expansion if you will plus our dallas expansion is going to cost us something around over our more normalized run rate if you will ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you operator weve reached the end of the questionandanswer session at this time id like to turn the call over to phil green for closing comments phillip d green chairman chief
