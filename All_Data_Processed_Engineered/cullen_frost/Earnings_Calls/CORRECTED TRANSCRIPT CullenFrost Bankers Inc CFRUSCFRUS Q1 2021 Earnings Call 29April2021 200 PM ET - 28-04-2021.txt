ill review first quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will provide some additional comments before we open it up to your questions in the first quarter cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year and million or a share in the fourth quarter of in a very challenging economic environment our team not only continued to execute on our strategies but also achieved some extraordinary accomplishments that ill discuss in detail as we go through the call economic impacts of the pandemic continue to affect loan demand overall average loans in the first quarter were billion an increase of compared with billion in the first quarter of last year but excluding ppp loans first quarter average loans of billion represented a decline of just over compared to the first quarter of average deposits in the first quarter were billion and they were an increase of compared to billion in the first quarter of last year obviously macroeconomic factors over the past year have impacted our deposit growth but its also been our experience over our history that indiscernible frost that were a safe haven for customers in times of uncertainty our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were and respectively we did not record a credit loss expense related to loans in the first quarter after recording a credit loss expense of million in the fourth quarter our asset quality outlook is stable and experienced a meaningful improvement during the first quarter in general problem assets are declining in number and new problems have dropped significantly and are at prepandemic levels net chargeoffs for the first quarter dropped sharply to million from million in the fourth quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the first quarter were just basis points of average loans nonperforming assets were million at the end of the first quarter down from the million at the end of the fourth quarter and a year ago nonperformers stood at million overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the first quarter were million or basis points of period end loans thats stable when compared to the end of and comparable to what weve experienced in the past several years of the billion and 90day deferrals granted to borrowers that weve discussed on previous calls only about million remain in deferment at the end of the first quarter total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were million at the end of the first quarter compared with million at the end of the fourth quarter energyrelated problem loans continue to decline and were million at the end of the first quarter compared to million for the previous quarter to put that in perspective total problem energy loans peaked at nearly million early in in general energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the first quarter as a reminder that figure was at the end of the fourth quarter and the peak was back in we continue to work hard to rationalize our companys exposure to the energy segment to appropriate levels overall we find that credit quality is improving when the pandemic started last year we assembled teams to analyze the nonenergy portfolio segments that we considered the most at risk which included restaurants cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 hotels entertainment sports and retail the total of these portfolio segments excluding ppp loans represented just billion at the end of the first quarter and our loan loss reserve for these segments was the credit quality of individual credits in these segments is mostly stable or better compared to the end of the fourth quarter and the outlook is improving although macroeconomic trends impacting some segments will take time to fully digest the hotel segment where we have million outstanding remains our most atrisk category however we believe our exposure to any significant loss is minimal im very proud of our teams ability to build relationships with new customers in challenging times particularly when so much effort was put into helping existing small business customers get ppp loans during the first quarter we added more new commercial relationships than we did in the first quarter of last year a good portion of those mentioned ppp is the reason they came to frost but even more of them were just from the continued hard work by our bankers and the level of service that we provide new loan commitments booked during the first quarter excluding ppp loans were down by compared to the first quarter of which was before the economic impact of the pandemic had been felt so this comparison clearly shows the impact of the pandemic on loan demand regarding new loan commitments booked the balance between these relationships was nearly even with larger core at the end of the first quarter we will continue to keep this balance in mind in total the percentage of deals lost to structure was and it was fairly consistent with the we saw this time last year however keep in mind we believe thats a higher number and it illustrates the competition out there through underwriting our weighted current active loan pipeline in the first quarter was up about compared with the end of the fourth quarter so though modest it was good to see some improvement consumer banking also continues to see outstanding growth overall our net new consumer customer growth rate for the first quarter was up compared to the first quarter of samestore sales as measured by account openings were up by through the end of the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of and up a nonannualized on a linkedquarter basis in the first quarter of our account openings came from our online channels including our frost mobile app we believe this compares very well to the industry online account openings were higher when compared to the first quarter of consumer loan portfolio was billion at the end of the first quarter up by compared to the first quarter of last year were nearing the completion of our previously announced houston expansion we opened well we opened the 23rd of the planned new financial centers in april and the remaining two will be open in the coming weeks overall the new financial centers are exceeding our expectations this is one of the extraordinary accomplishments that i mentioned earlier our teams performance of keeping the momentum going in houston despite the pandemic and all the work we put into ppp is a true credit to our outstanding staff now let me share with you where we stand with the expansion as of march for the locations we had opened at that time and it excludes ppp loans our numbers of new households were of target and represents over new individuals and businesses our loan volumes were of target and represented million in outstanding cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 lets look at the mix of this portfolio about represent commercial credits with about consumer they represent just under half ci loans about a quarter investor real estate consumer and around non profit and public finance finally with only three loans over million over are core loans now lets look at deposits at million they represent of target they represent about twothirds commercial and onethird consumer weve seen increasing momentum over the last year when we were about of our target what i hope this demonstrates and whats important to understand is that the character of the business we are generating through the expansion is very consistent with the overall company its just what we do and you can see that its profitability will be driven by small and midsized businesses im extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do in houston and i believe you should be too weve built a platform that will add shareholder value for years to come and thats why im happy to share that we will be taking the lessons and skills weve learned in the houston market to a very similar opportunity we have before us in dallas early next year with new locations over a 30month period this will put us on a path to triple our number of locations in that dynamic market over that time turning now to ppp our team was ready to respond when sba reopened the application process in january to date weve taken in about new loan applications in the second round of ppp with over billion funded combined with our total from the first round last year we funded more than loans or billion just amazing weve also been working hard to help those borrowers get loans forgiven weve invited all of the round borrowers to apply for forgiveness and weve submitted of those loan balances to the sba and we received forgiveness on about already because this process is vital to our borrowers were doing all the work inhouse with frost bankers we havent outsourced any of these efforts were excited to announce that on april weve launched a new feature for our consumer customers called overdraft grace this feature is an investment in our organic growth strategy and at the same time we believe it will make a difference on our customers lives it clearly sets us apart from both traditional bank competitors and neobanks as a result we expect it to further increase the rate of new customer growth in our already growing consumer bank also this month we received some good news from thirdparty organizations that assess our customer service the greenwich excellence awards where frost has had the highest scores for superior service advice and performance to small business and middle market banking clients for four consecutive years let us know that our already high overall satisfaction and net promoter scores went up even higher over while many of our competitors saw declines and im very pleased to let you know that jd power associates just this week announced that frost once again received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in texas in the retail banking satisfaction study thats the 12th consecutive year weve had the highest scores in texas when you put it all together the solid financial results the healthy numbers in deposits and loans all the new relationships the goodwill from our ppp efforts the houston expansion and the customer service accolades it shows that when we care about customers and work to be a force for good in their everyday lives well be rewarded and i dont just mean rewarded in a financial sense i mean in the sense that people recognize that were doing something important and were doing it better than just about anyone else cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 was a tough year and hasnt been easy so far but things are looking up and thats due to everything that our employees have been doing for our company and our customers in these difficult times and im very optimistic about our outlook appreciate all their hard work and im proud of them and im proud to be at frost now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease was impacted by a higher proportion of earning assets being invested in lower yielding balances at the fed in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter partially offset by the positive impact of the ppp loan portfolio interestbearing deposits at the fed earning basis points averaged billion or of our earning assets in the first quarter up from billion or of earning assets in the prior quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans our net interest margin percentage would have been in the first quarter down from an adjusted for the fourth quarter the taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was up basis points from the previous quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been basically flat with the prior quarter average loan volumes in the first quarter of billion were down million from the fourth quarter average of billion excluding ppp loans average loans in the first quarter were down about million or from the fourth quarter with about three quarters of that decrease related to energy loans to add some additional color on our ppp loans as phil mentioned we funded over billion of round ppp loans during the first quarter this was offset by approximately million in forgiveness payments during the quarter on round loans bringing our total round forgiveness payments to approximately billion at the end of the first quarter we had approximately million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized with about onethird of this related to round loans with respect to round loans given the smaller dollar size of the loan and changes in the forgiveness process we expect this portfolio to have a shorter average life than the round portfolio as a result we currently expect about of the remaining net deferred fees to be recognized this year looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the first quarter down about million from the fourth quarter average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the first quarter flat with the fourth quarter the yield on the taxable portfolio which averaged billion was down basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mortgagebacked securities given faster prepayment speeds and to a lesser extent lower yields associated with recent purchases our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the first quarter down million from the fourth quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of flat with the prior quarter at the end of the first quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured investment purchases during the first quarter were approximately million and consisted about of about million each in treasuries and mortgagebacked securities respectively with the remainder being cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 municipals our current projections only assume that we make investment purchases of about billion for the year which will help us to offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments in ph costs regarding noninterest expense looking at the fullyear we currently expect an annual expense growth of something around the to range from our total reported noninterest expenses in regard to the estimates for fullyear earnings given our first quarter results and our assumption of similar to improving credit metrics to those we saw in the first quarter we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of is too low with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry ill now open it up for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from ken zerbe from morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you i guess the first question in terms of the allowance for credit losses exppp it looks like in your press release you said it went up basis points i believe to can you just talk about why it went up i mean just given the context that most of the banks are materially releasing reserves thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure ken obviously you know frost you followed us for a long time obviously very conservative we continue to be concerned about whats going on in certain industries commercial real estate for example and just given where we are and the expectation of what could still come whether that be variant whether that be issues associated with office buildings and whether employees come back to work whether thats related to hotels and lodging i think we just felt like it was too early in the process to release reserves our modeling results in the commercial real estate category would actually have we would have required if you will from a modeling standpoint that we have a lower reserve associated with them but really in our evaluation we created a management overlay just given the challenges that we potentially see out there in some of those covidimpacted industries and so i think phil mentioned the covidimpacted industries there they are still out there at billion weve got a reserve associated with them at billion so i think part of it is just were not out of the woods and dont feel like were out of the woods and so now didnt really feel the need and certainly felt like we could substantiate the allowance that weve got on our books and obviously through rest of the year well continue to look at that we didnt book a credit expense in the first quarter given what were seeing today i dont expect to have a provision to be quite honest with you assuming the same sort of credit metrics that we saw in the first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 but again a lot of it will be just dependent on what our credit quality people are doing our special assets people are doing and what theyre seeing in the marketplace but at this point given what we were seeing and what we were feeling we felt like keeping our reserve basically flat is the way i looked at it to go from to basically flat i thought was a good place for us to be you did note that we only had million in net chargeoffs during the quarter we were helped by pretty strong recoveries we actually had recoveries of million so again i think were comfortable with where were at and certainly are looking towards the rest of the year and hoping that things continue to improve and as we go through each of the quarters well continue to evaluate our allowance and react accordingly ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc certainly makes sense and then just my followup question sort of a twopart question i guess in terms of expenses it looks like expenses came in noticeably lower than probably us and consensus were expecting so first question is what drove the lower expenses this quarter but the second part is can you just talk about the incremental expenses related to the dallas expansion and when do they start are they already part of your estimate sorry your guidance that you gave thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure regarding the dallas expansion i think phil noted that we really wouldnt start that until next year and we dont give any sort of guidance on if youre looking for any sort of an impact what i would suggest you do is go back to kind of what we said about the houston expansion i think at that point we had talked about the first year results was like a negative impact given the fact that expenses start before the operations and i think in that case we were talking about branches in two years this one were talking about a little bit longer extended period i think we said for over months but i think thats the sort of color and work that i would do if i was on your end if you were trying to put some dollars into your estimates as far as expenses for the quarter just a reminder we did have some deferred fees associated with the origination of the ppp loans i think that number was i was trying to get it here if i remember correctly it was like million that was actually capitalized and gets netted against the fees and accreted into interest so thats obviously having an impact but in addition to that we had our processes in place and our program in place to reduce expenses last year i think the team did a good job you heard us talking about that so i think were seeing some of that impact as well in the first quarter and so well continue to keep our eyes focused on expenses so thats really i guess how id say did you have another question there i cant remember the third part ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh no actually you addressed both parts of my expense question jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay all right cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc ph im all right so thank you very much jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc all right sure operator your next question is from jennifer demba from truist securities your line is open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hi thank you in terms of the dallas branch expansion what kind of loans and deposit growth would you expect from those offices would it be materially different from the houston expansion or roughly the same phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc jennifer im going to say its going to be roughly the same in our view right now given how competitive our dallas and houston markets are i cant imagine our dallas cohorts would let houston outshine them there so i think it will be pretty much the same here dallas is really a tremendous market for business particularly small and midsized business and i think its going to be really a great expansion force i think it will be in my opinion i think it will be at least as good as our dallas expansion our houston expansion jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc any lessons learned from the houston expansion that youll bring forward for the ph dallas one that you picked up over the last couple of years as the world has shifted a little bit phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the one lesson you learn and its basic its about people thats the number one thing you want to hire people that are consistent with your culture who are excited about being part of an organization like ours and if you do the right job hiring people in these submarkets they can really be successful with everything that we bring to the table supporting them i think thats been the best thing to learn the other thing weve learned is were getting pretty good at bringing them on and i want to emphasize every time that were not bringing on teams were not lifting teams out and putting them in our organization were talking to individuals and people that believe in what were doing and want to be a part of it and were also finding that when you do that well that you begin to get followon from people in the organizations that have come over and said hey this is what we thought it would be and i know this person or that person whod be really great with this and so youre not i mean you have a little bit more certainty about who youre bringing on and the fit as you move through the strategy i think thats what weve seen in houston and well continue to expand in houston theres some submarkets that we want to be in that we didnt pick up on the first time and just do a regular just growing our business were going to want to continue to expand there and i think that weve got good cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 momentum there and weve got good follow on like i talked about in that market so i feel like thats going to be successful but thats one thing i think that weve learned and the other thing id say jennifer is its really important to go through the steps dont skip steps we know what we need to do to develop a market we know that we need to be there early with the community leaders like six months early before we open up the branch we surround them with a team we get them involved and if you have a market where you where we i think one of our really early one in houston we had someone leave earlier we werent able to close on bringing in a community leader and that branch was it suffered early on because you couldnt do all the steps that you needed so were really focused on bringing the people on and while jerry mentioned correctly that there wont really be much of an impact this year of that expansion we hope to open our first location in january of next year in dallas theres a lot of effort that weve been undertaking to understand the submarkets we want to be in and therell be even more effort about bringing all the right people for those markets and theres a whole lot of spadework that has to happen before you actually execute this stuff im so excited about doing it so im really looking forward to what its going to be for us jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc youre welcome operator your next question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to first follow up on the increase in new commercial relationships that you cited for the first quarter are these customers coming from banks of all sizes or is there one cohort struggling more than others now to retain customers and maybe can you include in your response what is the friction point that these customers are signing when theyre moving over to frost cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well the main source of these relationships not the only but the main source is what i call the too big to fail the big three lets say and i hesitate to say that theres any one that is providing a much greater share than any other we choose to compete against those three banks in the texas market and its not an accident and we to be honest we compete very well with them and were not afraid of competing with them and so thats it makes sense to me that thats where wed see most of our new relationships and then your second part of your question im sorry steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc it was whats the friction point like when they move over its such a big increase that youre seeing in the year and im just curious what are they citing in terms of its a bigger deal to move a commercial relationship than consumer so when theyre moving it whats sort of the straw that broke the camels back why now theyre moving or are you seeing more customers move to you now phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc id say its ppp i mean more than anything else it matters where you bank its like a woman that totally she didnt realize years ago that where she opened a checking account would be an existential decision for her business and whether she could get a ppp loan when she needed it and that really is i think the biggest outsized reason were seeing ive got a number in here somewhere about how many of these relationships were from ppp jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah phil if i can chime in just a bit phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc the other thing weve heard in the case of the ppp loans is that in some cases its some of our customers that had successful ppp experiences with us referring some of their friends and prospects and in other cases people had such a bad experience at their bank with ppp and have heard the successes weve had and how easy it was to get it done with us that weve seen them come in that way and the other thing that ive heard mentioned also as far as theyre moving over is really in some cases some of those too big to fail as phil mentioned are really referring some of these customers more to call centers so they dont necessarily have that same relationship manager that they could call and look in the eye shake hands with or go to lunch with sort of thing and so because of their size in some cases theyre being deferred more to call centers weve heard that come up as well cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful to shift gears so looking at the new program for overdraft which is interesting when you say with that program that customers need to make a deposit after the overdraft you say as soon as possible what exactly does that mean a couple of your peers that have launched that give hours but what does that mean as soon as possible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well first of all thats not our program our program is that if youve got a direct deposit with us that deposit is at least a month well pay you overdraft of or less and we wont charge you fee steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay i thought i saw there making a deposit i might have been referencing something else phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc so i think it was jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its a direct deposit phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc direct deposit jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah you have to have a direct deposit steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just a direct deposit as soon as indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc in order to qualify direct deposit you qualify for the program phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and so once you establish a direct deposit you qualify for the program cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc and the reason thats how we would define the relationship that way right if you got a direct deposit you got a relationship and you get that benefit steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you and then just finally on this program whats the anticipated reduction in service charge revenue from the program thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the number that were projecting is i think we looked at this first quarter and we saw that our consumer nsf od fees would be down about million so i think thats about of what we saw in the quarter obviously going forward a lot of it will be dependent on the sort of activity we have but thats what we saw the impact in the first quarter would have been in the first quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so jerry whats the fullyear impact just the fullyear revenue impact jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i guess i would say thats going to be dependent on the volumes right so if its million for a quarter then yeah it could potentially be less than that just depending on less or more depend on the activity steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so not material okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i dont think its going to be significant i think that the you got two things going on when you look at the overdraft line as activity picks up youre going to see overdraft activity pick up anyway and so really what were doing is were investing what some of that increase would have been and i think we could be sort of flattish versus on overdraft fees well see how it what happens its a new program well see how it goes but i think its really a good opportunity to differentiate ourselves steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah terrific thanks for taking my questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator your next question is from brad gailey sic brady gailey from kbw brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey its brady gailey phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc we all know you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc we know who you are brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats right yeah i wanted to start just with the amount of cash that you are all sitting on youre sitting on billion of cash thats basically earning zero and thats a huge lever for you all to pull at some point to start to move those funds into the bond book where obviously the yields are higher maybe just talk about how you think about when is the right time to pull that lever and if you look at the yield curve today and its off but its still not great so do we start to see that today or do you wait for rates to go a little higher phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady let me just talk a bit about it i think the short answer is were going to wait a little longer i believe that the we could be wrong but our gut is that were seeing rates increase i mean we made this decision in august last year when the tenure is basis points or so and its paid off for us were not great bond traders we just believe that with the economy opening up with the amount of fiscal stimulus its in there the monetary stimulus it just makes sense that were going to see this impact and we just dont want to bet were going to be employing shareholders money were going to be smart about doing it i would think its going to be later in this year yeah i would guess maybe later third quarter but it could be later i think were our bet is were going to see some increased rates as just things open up and things improve and i think that feds willing to accept that and so were going to thats the way were going to lean cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 i really feel one of the things that im really proud of the organization for doing is with the reduction in expenses that we talked about last quarter where we had basically million in 2020s run rate million followon in thats about million worth of expenses it really gave us the ability i think to maintain this optionality weve got the its provided us some operating leverage to frankly take a wait and see and its paying off for us and id say brady that im really optimistic about our outlook i think the view weve got for the next several years for the business and we could be wrong and like i say theres i think it was george foreman that might have said it everyones got a plan until you get hit in the mouth but we did some heavy lifting with expenses it gave us the ability to wait on this liquidity bill weve got this liquidity bill thats there jerry whats our current number now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc were at billion phil phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc around billion now in the fed and i think we employ this later this year that will help us some this year but its also going to help us as we move into im not very optimistic on loan growth through the rest of this year we could see some but i mean businesses got tons of liquidity and id love to see some but im not going to bet on it but i think later in the year i think we could see it and i think in were going to see it and i think that could build some momentum in going into the fed has said that theyll beginning increasing rates in maybe they can wait that long but lets say they do i think thats going to give us some tremendous tailwinds as far as that develops and then as we move pass that indiscernible and so weve got these investments that weve made in the houston market thatll be mature at that point and well be beginning to see some maturity in some of the dallas investments so i really feel in my opinion things set up very well for us if thats the scenario that we get and thats what im hoping well see brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that makes sense then longerterm i mean if you look in the first quarter cash to average earning assets was it sounds like its even higher than that as of today but where would you like to keep that longerterm i think precovid that was running about to of average earning assets does that feel like a more normalized level of cash to earning assets jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah brady i think weve been running just a little bit above that we werent in the doubledigits so i would have if you would ask me i thought we were in the range typically brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the thing ill say im sorry brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc go ahead jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i was going to say yeah for us its just weve always been a little bit different right we typically have more liquidity than most but yeah right now where were at is really way up there and yeah not something that we would expect to have longer term and i think something in the mid to high singledigits its where wed be brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then phil congrats on the houston expansion and its exciting to hear about dallas you couldve bought a bank in houston but you didnt and you could have bought a bank in dallas but you didnt a lot of people are talking about texas being a fairly active geography for ma is frost kind of out of the ma game at this point and more pursuing organic de novo strategy from here of phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think the short answer to that is yes you never say never on an acquisition and ive said many times that an acquisition that would the only kind of acquisition that would make sense for a company like ours is one that gives you the ability to execute on organic strategy in a place creating a platform that you werent before and ive always given the example that north texas in was a great example of that with overton but theres no better market that i can think of than the texas market right now economically and i think from a banking standpoint for what we do with business small business and all and so its and ill give you an example brady on i was talking about consumer growth right well let me talk about net new checking households all right this is organic growth im looking at a piece of paper if you go back to so im looking at a little over three years okay three years and a quarter we hit net new checking households in a month one basically onetime prior to september of okay so from january of to september we hit net new checking households onetime if you look at october through march weve hit that one two three four times and one of that we had the february freeze so that shut everything down we didnt do it there but ive got so you got october december january and march net new checking households thats why were focused on organic growth and houston has been a help for that in that growth and the things that were doing with regard to like the overdraft overdraft grace thats going to catch peoples attention weve gotten good at digital marketing and so thats why i dont want to be spending a lot of shareholders money to throw the long ball and hope something good happens im really confident of what were doing and im excited about our prospects cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that makes sense and clearly its working for you guys so keep it up thanks for the color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi ebrahim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess first yeah its good to see your bank organically investing and being proud of those investments so its good to see you do that i guess one question phil as we come to the end of our earnings season you just said that youre not optimistic of loan growth picking up in this year driven by the liquidity that businesses are sitting on which is a little bit of a contrast to what weve heard from i would say of your peers whove talked about a pickup in the middle of the year talk to us in terms of are you being overly conservative when youre messaging this or do you think some of your peers might be a little ahead of themselves in expecting a loan growth rebound in the summer phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc ebrahim im a frost banker so im going to be a little conservative but we are seeing some pickup in commercial real estate i will say that but the ci still we really havent seen it our we have something we call look to book how many looks are we getting what are we booking and community banking was down about well about on what they booked a lot of our declines yearoveryear in terms of booking we had a decline in public finance because we had a great year last year we had a couple of really large deals but we had a decline in energy and thats on purpose so were just trying to rationalize our position there so some of it is were some of it is energy i like to say some of its public finance i still think that businesses are cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 being careful with expansion and i think the supply chain issues are real it might be keeping people from doing something they would have otherwise done and so im just we have a higher percentage of ci loans than most people and since we havent seen that come back right now im not that bullish on that for the rest of the year i could be wrong by the end of the year it could be better but thats just the way im seeing it right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it understood and then just one followup jerry on expenses i guess your guidance implies a rampup in expenses back to like the million million range just remind us of the drivers that we thats going to drive expenses higher from levels jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure let me grab some information here one thing i will say is one of the things that is impacting growth of course is the houston expansion so the houston expansion by itself is growing noninterest expenses about million so that is part of it as we mentioned the branch openings came on a little bit slower than we expected but just looking forward i guess the things that could affect us going forward some of it is commission revenues of course associated with certain pieces of the revenue businesses that where revenues were tied with commissions so i think we could see some impact there typically the first quarter is our softest quarter intentionally on advertising and marketing so well see some of that continue to pick up its an area that weve really been extremely cautious about even as we were managing our expenses it wasnt an area that we wanted to go in and slash and burn the marketing budget we think its important to continue to grow customer growth so youll see some increases there and i think those are probably the two big areas that i would point out and were going to continue to spend continue to spend im sorry on the first quarter first quarter you saw an increase in technology furniture and equipment and thats just something that were going to continue to see increases in and its built into our numbers ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and jerry earlier you talked about like a million ppp related was that a ppp expense thats running through the expense line if you dont mind clarifying that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure no those are so under accounting guidance you capitalize your origination costs and so there were million in origination costs that basically come out of expenses and get netted against the fees and that gets accreted into income so other things being equal expenses would have been if we did not have those ppp loans expenses would have been million higher ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 thats helpful thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator your next question is from dave rochester from compass point your line is open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just back on the expense guide real quick just on the dallas piece if we go back to like take a look at annual expense growth that was around mid to high singledigits would you kind of do you think thats generally in the ballpark of what you guys are expecting at this point without trying to pin you down to an exact number jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc were really kind of hesitant on giving any sort of guidance i mean its really our policy not to give guidance into the anything beyond the current year so i guess i was really kind of just trying to give you some guidance of thoughts that you might consider going forward if you kind of look back at the houston phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc im glad jerry pointed that out too because one of the things we thought about and weve talked to investors about talked to some of you about is that what were doing right now is were almost running two companies its one company one culture but we have what i call the sort of the core piece of the business which is our very profitable its very efficient runs very well and then weve got an expansion piece where we are investing capital investing operating leverage into markets for us to grow and thats like any business you invest at and whether its a technology business or whether its any other kind of business when youre starting something new its got a burn rate associated with it and if we kind of indiscernible together the expansion piece and the core piece it kind of confuses a little bit sometimes its helpful to us to look at the business on a core basis and then look at it on the expansion basis because i think both are doing exactly what we intend for them to do in fact as we pointed out maybe better than we originally intended for them to do but when you bring them all together it confuses whats really going on with the operations of the company cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 for example when jerry mentioned or when we started what was it beginning of we had a growth rate in expenses but a fair amount of that was still in the expansion and so we dont want to give the wrong impression that were loosely spending around here were actually pretty tight about it but a good part of that will be over time this expansion david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay appreciate that turning back on the question on securities appreciated your thoughts there on maybe putting some more cash to work around or after that it sounds like youre sort of expecting higher rates later this year so i was just curious is it a certain level of the tenure youre looking at is it 2plus is it higher muni rates any kind of benchmark to look at to know that you guys are right there and starting to put money to work any other parameters there we can look at thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i listened to indiscernible yesterday and he was kind of talked about substantial words like substantial improvement that type of thing i think well know it when we see it i think directionally we just expect to see it move up and i think that the timing will be right for us later in the year i mean personally id be dead wrong but i think well see indiscernible something in that range over the next several months and so if we dont have to pull the trigger we wont but i think i expect that we probably will begin moving into the market late third quarter maybe fourth quarter sometime i hate to pin ourselves down but so far its worked knock on wood and its our conviction that itll continue to move that way david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and maybe one last one just on loan pricing have you guys hit general parity at this point on where new loan yields coming in versus where the book yield is ex all the ppps and whatnot jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i would say that that ill answer it in two ways what i was really impressed with was from the third quarter to the fourth quarter our pricing has really stayed fairly consistent and been pretty strong and in fact ive been able to do that even as the libor continues to go down a couple of few basis points it seems like every quarter but when i was looking at the back book versus the current book im still seeing overall about basis points lower on the new book versus the back david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay all right great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question is from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey jerry what would you say is like a median or average branch size for your company in terms of deposits jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc im going to gosh let me see if ive got anything here we are on average jon typically tend to be bigger than most so let me hear it hold on a second jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc as youre thinking through it let me ask ph phil another question jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc any reason why the houston and dallas branches cant get to your corporate average and how long does it take to get there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon what i would do when you look at that i mean you can do this with the fdic database is i would say yes theres a reason why there probably wouldnt be the average of our branches because any headquarters branch in a city tends to be really outsized large so whenever we look at what were doing and where we are in the marketplace we tend to take out any locations that for any competitor and ourselves thats million or more okay and then we look at that as sort of normalized branches not including headquarters effects and i think if you do that i dont think theres any reason why these locations shouldnt be in line with our other ones over time cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay i was just kind of looking for like a median as maybe a way to get to that type of number jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah let me see if i can find anything here jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay i guess indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc it looks like its yeah again and ill ask ab to kind of verify with you im kind of going through my tableau stuff here pretty quickly but maybe something in the million but ill get ab to verify that with you but thats what im seeing based on the report im looking at in tableau but well make sure we confirm that with you but i think with the exercise that phil mentioned is really kind of what we typically do if were looking at any sort of a comparison well take out the big downtown centers and then come up with an average that way jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and is the strategy to put branches in areas that are faster growing i mean from the outside we all hear about this tremendous growth in texas but is that the general strategy is to put branches in places that are growing quickly where you just dont have the presence phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc id say it depends theres certainly some that are we tend to look at without i guess i shouldnt throw out all the secret sauce but let me just say that we look for areas that are growing there may be different levels of growth but we look for consistent growth in the markets we like to look at places where obviously were not located we think theres tremendous value in that and its okay with us if there are a lot of too big to fill competitors there too because thats who we compete with and so things like that there are a lot more but those are some of the things we look at jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc two more questions here do you need to be larger in austin as well over time phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think so i think so i think the what we are i think i mentioned this last time austin is really intriguing to us given whats happening with that market and just the growth its just explosive really but remember the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 strategy that were employing is a businesscentric small and midsized business strategy thats where the profitability is driven austin is theres a lot of rooftops going there theres some theres a lot of inmigration of centers like with facebook or indeed or google or whatever tesla what we need to see is follow on of small businesses right we dont want to just go there with just a real estate strategy or just a consumer strategy its harder to be profitable with the locations if youve just got a consumer strategy im confident were going to see it its just that im more confident that those are already there in vast numbers in dallas and well just have to decide what the payoff will be of a branch expansion strategy in austin and were going to continue expand in the market but for us to do something say like weve done in houston or dallas i think jerry is still a little bit out on that one jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc last question how would you compare san antonio in terms of growth against say dallas or houston how does it stack up phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i would say that dallas is growing faster and austin is growing faster given whats going on with houston and the energy slowdown for a while i would say were comparable to houston jerry might have some different thoughts but the thing thats great about san antonio is it doesnt seem to have the high highs or the low lows jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats what i was going to say yeah exactly phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its very stable it creates lots of cash flow and lots of capital always has for us to expand in other markets its a great market to be in its great having the market share that we have here and we dont intend to give it up so even if it were a little bit slower it is more stable and it has a lot of benefits in that regard jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the conversation we had with the dallas fed economists san antonio kind of popped out a little bit and this is just more current data right we were looking at march and april information but the surprising thing there was how strong san antonio had performed relatively speaking i think that was a comment he was making that he thought that san antonio had rebounded quicker but as phil said yeah san antonio typically doesnt have the highs or the lows lets say a dallas or a houston i think it kind of just tends to chug along a little bit more more on the road but recently what we were hearing was we performed better than expected jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right all right thanks for all the thoughts appreciate it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and one last thing on the branch thing the number that i gave you around excuse me million gets you pretty close so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc all right operator im showing no further question at this time ill now turn the call back
