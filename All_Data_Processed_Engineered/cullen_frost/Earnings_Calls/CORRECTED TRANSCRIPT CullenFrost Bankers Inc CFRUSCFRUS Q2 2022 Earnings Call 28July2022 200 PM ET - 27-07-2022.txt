questions in the second quarter cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year and million or a share in the first quarter of this year our return on average assets and average common equity in the second quarter was and respectively these results in our overall growth show that our company is wellpositioned to succeed in whats been an unusual and evolving environment our loan growth was strong average loans excluding ppp in the second quarter were billion or higher than the average loans of billion in the second quarter of it was good to see our growth exceeded our typical goal of highsingledigit increases in the second quarter we booked more loan commitments than the same period last year all segments were strong with ci up cre up and consumer up in addition we saw new loan opportunities continue to increase they increased from a year ago and increased and unannualized on a linked quarter basis so the overall flow is good looking at our weighted 90day pipeline it was up from a year ago on linked quarter basis its fairly flat down as increases in commercial and consumer segments offset a reduction in the nearterm pipeline for commercial real estate average deposits in the second quarter were billion an increase of compared with the second quarter of last year and as much as we focus on loan growth we were very pleased with our growth in deposits because its through deposits that we build longterm relationships as we offer attractive value propositions that customers can trust growth in our consumer business continues to be strong our net addition of consumer households in the second quarter was an alltime high for us and represented an increase from the same period a year ago consumer loan growth was also strong on a linkedquarter annualized basis average consumer loans grew by led by increases in consumer real estate our success here was driven by our heloc home equity and home improvement products also our pipeline for these loans continues at record levels now regarding our expansion efforts in houston we see the momentum continuing as newly opened branches mature at the end of the second quarter we stood at of deposit goal of new household goal and of our loan goal our dallas expansion is admittedly in its very early innings however im encouraged that the preliminary results are similar to our houston success with of deposit goal of loan goal and of new household goal were making excellent progress towards launching our mortgage product and we expect to begin a pilot program toward the end of this year and as you know were designing the entire process from start to finish to originate and service mortgage loans in keeping with the great frost customer experience despite uncertainty about the broader economy weve seen no signs of increasing loan delinquency our overall credit quality remains good the june total for delinquencies excluding ppp was million or basis points of total loans total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher totaled million at the end of the second quarter and that was down from million at the end of the previous quarter once again we did not report a credit loss expense in the second quarter and net chargeoffs for the second quarter were million compared with million in the first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 annualized net chargeoffs for the second quarter were basis points of average loans and below our typical longterm level nonaccrual loans were million at the end of the second quarter a decrease from million at the end of the first quarter i was glad to see the great work of our energy team rationalizing our concentration in our energy portfolio energy loans represented of loans at the end of the second quarter and im happy to declare that weve reached midsingle digits finally after more than two years of working with over ppp borrowers weve helped better than of them with forgiveness our teams worked on the last few hundred ppp borrowers who havent yet begun the process and were committed to helping every one of them get across the finish line and i couldnt be more proud of our team and the efforts that theyve made in helping our customers and the business you may remember that ive described our efforts in this area as historic and heroic and while i hope we dont ever encounter another historic challenge like that any time soon as i mentioned earlier weve got strategies and systems in place to allow us to succeed in all economic environments and i should point out that frost employees do heroic deeds every day i continue to hear from customers who get help from our bankers in sorting out their final finances after a spouse passed away or who got financial planning that enabled their kids to go to college or who simply just had a pleasant interaction with the bankers while they were having an otherwise lousy day for us those interactions are just doing our jobs in accordance with frost philosophy to our customers those are heroic acts id like to thank our people for being a force for good in peoples everyday lives now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter higher yields on both loans and balances held at the fed had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage the increase was also positively impacted to a lesser extent by higher volumes of investment securities and loans and a lower relative percentage of earning assets invested in balances at the fed as compared to the prior quarter these positive impacts were partially offset by higher deposit costs looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter up million from the first quarter average as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion which included about billion in treasuries yielding about million in agency mbs securities with a yield of about and about million in municipal securities with a taxable equivalent yield of about our current expectation is that we would invest an additional billion of our excess liquidity into investment purchases through the remainder of the year the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was in the second quarter down basis point from the first quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up billion from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the second quarter down about million from the first quarter and had a taxable yield of up basis point from the prior quarter at the end of the second quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was years up from years at the end of the first quarter primarily related to the extended duration on lower coupon mortgagebacked securities looking at loans average loans for the quarter were billion up million from the first quarter or excluding the impact of ppp loans the average growth in the prior quarter would have been million or the taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was up basis points from the previous quarter looking at deposits on a linkedquarter basis average deposits were up billion or public fund balances which can be seasonal had a negative effect on the linkedquarter growth as those average balances were down million the linked quarter growth has come primarily from growth in average interestbearing deposits which were up billion or the cost of interestbearing deposits for the quarter was basis points up basis points from the first quarter regarding total noninterest expenses we continue to expect total noninterest expense for the fullyear to increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits over reported levels increasing our minimum wage to per hour in december of last year combined with continued market salary pressures our expansion efforts in dallas and houston and expenses associated with the rollout of our announced residential mortgage product are the primary drivers of the growth in noninterest expenses the effective tax rate for the second quarter was and our current expectation is our full year effective tax rate should be in the range of about to but that can be affected by discrete items during the year regarding the estimates for fullyear earnings our current projections include a 50basispoint fed rate increase in september followed by a 25basispoint increase in november with those rate assumptions we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of for is low with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay jerry thanks so much well open the call up for questions now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc wanted to start so given such a low loantodeposit ratio and plenty of liquidity to fund loan growth what was the thought behind driving such strong growth in interest bearing deposits in the quarter or were these primarily just coming from new markets phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc steven its as much as anything this is a cultural decision and its one thats based on experience to i mean weve a big part of our value proposition really i mean it rests on three things that everyones significant for us that would give a square deal itll give you an excellent set of fair price and were safe sound place to do business for employees and customers and as corny as it sounds were just giving our customers a square deal as weve seen interest rates move up it just makes sense for us to recognize that if were going to have a value proposition that customers can trust like i mentioned earlier in my comments and we saw this happen back in when we saw the fed rates raise a basis points back then we were focused on the too big to fail pricing because thats who we compete with more than anybody else they havent moved at all and we just we just got behind we started to see some movement in deposits at that time and interestingly that was kind of when we sort of cracked the code on more consistent core loan growth and it just wasnt the right time number one for a balance sheet to show that nothing is i just really felt like we were losing trust and the industry was losing trust when they just sat there as and people read that interest rates are going up all the time so im not saying we couldnt have a lower rate and get away with it if you will but just thats not the way to do business and so its really just focusing on being fair with the customers and we just feel like the value of those deposits are continuing to increase and certainly the relationships are going to make your money on a longterm basis cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 jerry any thoughts there on prices jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i think youve got it phil i mean thats exactly what were doing i think youre right if we dont have to increase and ill put that in air quotes but i think we certainly believe that its the right thing from a culture standpoint to be increasing these deposits and as phil said in we were a little slow in raising rates we kind of fell behind and certainly felt like by midjuly when the fed had raised rates basis points that we were behind and actually were starting to see some of our deposits leaving the bank and as we all know its a lot more expensive to bring the new deposits on so we just felt like this time will be a little bit more ratable as we move along as rates increase steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc steven the thing is to i mean look you can read the newspaper and we can believe we know whats happening because thats what everyone is saying but we dont know where rates are going and we dont know where inflation is headed or what the feds been doing indiscernible but if we just change our business do it the right way as we go along were not going to have to go into any big dislocations like we did in when we that was pretty tough for our shareholders for us to have chuck all that down at one time and we just its all about just being disciplined as we move on steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc its interesting because many peers are allowing deposits to run off this quarter right and their loan to deposit ratios are going up fairly materially so here youre holding it pretty steady so if we follow that strategy forward how should we think about deposit betas through this cycle versus where you were the last time rates moving higher jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc steven i think what we said last quarter and i would say the same thing today going back to the last cycle say through our betas were about a on interestbearing and say on total and thats sort of what were assuming right now for fullyear weve got that same sort of beta we dont have that today given the increases were a little bit lighter than that but then our projection is thats what we built in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay then final question its good to hear the new markets continue to trend well above goal particularly for loans and new households in dallas was the goal too low im curious why youre coming in so far ahead of the goal thanks cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well when we started the program and we talked to our board about it and talked to each other about it i mean our goal was based upon what we had achieved for the locations that we had opened prior to starting that strategy we went back years and we said look this is what weve done on average and we said if we can do that that strategy was successful and we said if we can do that that will be successful itll result in a great return for shareholders so weve set that up as sort of and thats what we want to do and i kind of wanted to keep it the same as we moved into dallas because i think it kind of gives a context for the performance in those markets and so could we use a different number yeah we could but we know what this one means we know where it came from and were going to go there i will say steven that honestly i dont think theres any reason why dallas shouldnt be better than houston in terms of its success because as you know twothirds to of this business and of the business in the pro forma is commercial business and dallas has as good a commercial market that is really well diversified and full of middle market and small business with a little bit less energy concentration as houston and as great as houston is i think the business demographics around dallas could be even better steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i appreciate all the color thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please proceed with your question michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions just wanted to touch on expenses i think im doing the math right if i annualize the first half of the year looks like youre growing at about so would imply a deceleration in the back half of the year understanding that a lot of expenses related to dallas have been occurred and obviously wage inflation stuff like that but is that kind of the right way to think about is that the expense growth should kind of slow as they move through the back half of the year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think thats right i think a lot of the dollars that we put in are built into the base but we moved our increases for most of the organization to may so really even in the second quarter you dont have the full effect of all of our increases so i think that for us the fourth quarter is typically the highest and its unusually high given we pay a lot of our incentives in that quarter and so theres a lot of true of this going on obviously that the volumes that were seeing this year have been pretty strong and so i would envision that as we go through the year were continuing to increase those incentives cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 so i think that if i were you i would stick with my fullyear guidance and then just kind of take the next two quarters but really dont want to slice the cheese too thin and ill just kind of stick to that fullyear guidance that says just look at and grow that on a low double digit growth and i think youll youre kind of be kind of what were projecting currently based on what were seeing michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and then maybe just as a followup i think at the outset you mentioned that the pipelines were down about sequentially i mean it looks like the period end exppp growth slowed a little bit this quarter versus last quarter any rationale for that is it a function of paydowns is that customers being a little less active a combination of both and i think you had previously talked about kind of a highsingledigit exppp average growth for the year is that still kind of in the realm of expectations thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well i dont i dont want to read too much into the weighted pipeline number that was fairly flat down because if you look at the ci piece of that and this is on a nonannualized basis it was up on a linked quarter basis right so we multiply that times so i dont know if you want to do that or not but i mean its this positive the consumer weighted pipeline is up a nonannualized and it was really the fact that it was commercial real estate that was down and nonannualized so and we closed so many commitments we were our commitments were up on a linkedquarter basis nonannualized i mean thats putting a lot through the pipeline and so if it goes down somewhere its a little weaker and really its mainly in the commercial real estate id like to believe its more because were reloading on that and as i look at the opportunities that i talk about i think i talked about them theyre up like thats un annualized on a linkedquarter basis were up on a yearoveryear that tells me that were still on a growth basis seeing deals and were seeing growth in that so were going to keep our eye on it but the tone that i get michael from our officers is that its still good and were still seeing lots of opportunity youre seeing some id say i want to be careful the words i use you look at real estate particularly some kinds of real estate with the higher rates and uncertainty in some areas you can see still good deal flow but some beginning to slow some and id say obviously office for sure maybe a little bit of industrial on the investor side i think singlefamily housing is its not its not slowing really much but its i think we expect it to i think our borrowers expect it to but theyre also saying thats probably good cause they can really not keep up with the pace today but youre still seeing really good growth in multifamily for really good economic reasons youre seeing really good growth in retail just for example youve seen some good growth in owner occupied so the tone is still good but the other thing ill say is things are changing the fed try to slow things down and i think in texas that we are a were a little different in terms of the activity were seeing in terms of inmigration with individuals and businesses so id like to believe we can be a little bit more a little bit better than the general economy but anyway ive rambled too much on that but thats kind of what were seeing cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right i appreciate all the color thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thanks operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey just first question may be around credit was obviously credit is not an issue but just wanted to get a sense of how far down do you think the loan losses can go before you begin provisioning and just give us a perspective of where you think the steady state reserves ratio looks like if we start seeing some signs of a slowdown or even a potential recession over the next year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well what id say is that and we had this last quarter we have it again this quarter theres been quite a bit of color in the in the 10q but your part of our assumption as we work in our cecl model is the probability of a recession and so included in our overlays are is an assumption a assumption that there might be a recession and so we stress our portfolio accordingly and thats kind of what were at a reserve coverage right now which i think is pretty strong and when you look at that that discussion in the 10q i think youll see kind of what we were alluding to i mean as phil mentioned theres a lot of nuances going on in the economy right now a lot of uncertainty but really whats happening in our cases is giving some sort of probability to a recession where can it go i guess its cecl we when this was adopted we were probably at i dont i dont foresee that we bring our reserve coverage all things being equal and credit quality being great i dont see the reserve ending at but i think for now we certainly feel extremely comfortable with where were at from a reserve level cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 should the economy all of a sudden we get through this and feel like things are continuing to improve i could see that reserve coverage continue to continue to decrease ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just a separate question jerry i wanted to one confirm the billion number of securities was a net number as opposed to gross and just talk to us was the 10year yield is now at ph who knows whether and how much further the fed has to go talk to us on the other side of this if we do get into a period of fed rate cuts next year how are you thinking about protecting the margin jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah what ill say for now is that and what were looking at and its something that we visit about all the time right and right now were staying pretty consistent our purchases weve said would be treasuries and municipals and mbs securities and weve been pretty consistent with that weve moved around a little bit we might accelerate things but its something that were continually talking about and what were doing is really buying in the three to fiveyear thats really what were looking its where we saw the most value and where we made the bulk of our purchases well continue to have those conversations and well look at risk and reward and see what makes sense if we think that it makes sense to add duration if we think that rates might go down and we want to protect some of that we could do that obviously we still have plenty of liquidity i think this morning we were close to billion still even after all the purchases that weve made so well just its something that we continually visit with and i think that weve been pretty transparent and were continuing to look at derivative products we havent done anything yet well look and see if something makes sense for us weve done it in the past but at this point we havent put our toe in the water and well just continue to do that i will say that given the conversation earlier on deposit rates our deposit rates are much higher than most right and so in an environment where you see rates going down weve proven that we can bring rates down as well right weve been through a long rate cycle you followed our performance through a pretty low long period of zero interest rates so weve proven we can take our rates down and that given through the our value proposition to our customers we really havent lost deposits during that sort of time period so we do have that as well which some of our peers would not have if theyre not raising rates ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats fair thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 thank you good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so if you look at cash to average earning assets that finished the quarter at about you put another billion of cash into bonds it feels like by the end of the year it could be closer to 20orso percent longer term where would you like to run cash to assets does that get down to or is that too low longer term what level of cash would you like to have on the balance sheet jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc im looking at phil and im kind of laughing because every time our balance is at the fed decreased from billion to billion or something hes calling me and asking me whats going on in all seriousness you followed us for a while weve tended to be more conservative on our levels of cash but weve been all over the board and obviously we feel very comfortable and confident in alternative sources that we would have available to us i think that off the cuff if you said feels kind of low to us right now but so i would say something in that to is what we think about it and just see where we go from there brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i know last quarter we talked about spread income exppp potentially growing on a highteens basis but i mean after you look at the increase in margin and spread income that you guys enjoyed in the second quarter it feels like thats too low it feels like indiscernible and any refresh on how youre thinking about fed income yearoveryear jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i guess i would what i would say is yeah the environment today is different than where we were a quarter ago i think our assumption at that point the rates that we have in there now given the rate hikes that weve seen in june and july our assumptions are i think rates will end up the year higher basis points so yeah certainly given what given that sort of an environment yeah a midteens sort of growth in that in net interest income is it would be would be too low brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah and then just finally on deposit balances youve seen a lot of deposits shrink this quarter for some of your peers but you all saw some nice growth i know you increased deposit rates but do you think that youll see any sort of deposit outflows over the next year or so or are you guys really hoping to keep growing the core deposit base phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 i hope we keep growing i mean thats really what weve been focused on yeah i was just thinking about the question that jerry answered and got asked about interest rates and protection against interest rates i mean i think weve done a pretty decent job over time of coming up with ways to manage that but we really dont want to be defined by that what were more and more defining ourselves as is a company that is focused on growth and if were accessing great markets and we are were making the investments to grow in those markets and we get any kind of rates at all i mean fed could cut rates but maybe they cut into zero maybe not but we think that our job is pretty clear its just continue to grow the business that means growing deposits which is really where the value of any banking franchise is growing asset classes and weve got the opportunity to do that and with products weve got weve got the new mortgage product that were going to be bringing up at the end of the year direction of rates are important but as jerry said weve got some flexibility because we have been diligent in moving rates along with movements up and but i just tend to think that the more important thing for us to be focused on is can we continue to show this organic growth by accessing these markets and proving that we can take share brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that makes sense thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hello jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just want to go back to the nii guide so are you guys thinking high teens now or possibly low in terms of growth yearoveryear cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i would definitely be in the i wouldnt i guide you more to the and the highteens david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc low okay perfect and then do you happen to have the spot rate for interestbearing deposit cost at quarter end jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i dont have it on me right now i think ab is on so well have him reach out to you dave with that number i dont have it on me david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thats totally fine i appreciate that and then just a clarifying point the billion in securities purchases you have for the rest of the year thats in gross purchases right so growth would be somewhere billion billion if you havent had the maturities for the back half thatd be great but yeah so jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so weve probably got yeah we probably got another million million that would that would david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc it would be falling back to us so that numbers is gross yeah youre somewhere in the billion range net david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and then i guess for the positive trends those were very solid this quarter was very impressive was just curious if you had a component of that growth that came from houston and dallas versus the rest of the franchise and i know youd mentioned expecting high single digit deposit growth for are you still thinking in that range or do you think that maybe you could do a little bit better just given the better first half results jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc im still there i think phil you heard phil talk i think were optimistic that it can be better given continued new growth i think that as rates go up therell be more and more pressure obviously on us especially on some of those larger deposit balances cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc so yeah i mean thats what were projecting if it can be higher than that well definitely be happy but i do think its riskier the higher rates go on especially on those larger accounts and dave what was your other question phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc with regard to the expansion i think jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc oh yeah on the expansion so one thing that ill give you yearoveryear ill say they contributed towards the growth in average deposits phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and on loans yeah ill say that as well so they are starting to move the needle especially on that loan side david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great awesome maybe just one last one on credit jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc given you guys arent seeing any signs of anything it kind of feels like a zero provision its still good at least for the end of this year is that kind of how youre thinking about it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc everything that im seeing ill let phil talk too but everything that im seeing and hearing and sitting in in our cecl meetings thats really where im at right now and obviously phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its something that we cant project that far we continue were talking to our people in the credit area all the time but at this point im not hearing anything that gives me calls phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i mean cecl was cecl but its hard to envision a need right now based on everything david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense all right guys thanks appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is a followup from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey thanks just one followup question phil i guess outside of things that you are doing and then the strength in the market how are you seeing competitors behave one in terms of just the risk appetite are you seeing competitors loosen the underwriting box and then you mentioned you obviously go headtohead with the largest banks in your markets have you seen the bigger banks pull back a little bit given some of the capital constraints theyre facing phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc ebrahim in talking with our people in preparation for the call there may be some marginal improvement in structured competition not much but i did hear one of our teams mention how they had won a deal on our cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 traditional underwriting which they seem surprised to do i mean we do that all the time but i mean this particular instance it seemed like they were pleased to see that so id say its beginning to be a little bit more structurally sound but thats not pervasive i probably hear as many stories or more stories of where youre seeing competition continue to increase maybe beginning to see a little bit more competition on the ci side as opposed to just the commercial real estate side but its still competitive but things are slowing a bit i think in the real estate side i remember some conversations we had with builders who in some of these really hot markets were expecting to see a price change or reduction really by the end of the year in certain residential markets and the point they made is thats fine it may be a slowing that will help us catch our breath weve had i think times to bill go from days to days or something like that and theyve also got such wide margins historically high margins theyve got plenty of room to fade that and so i dont think it would be unwelcome in some ways to see a little bit of moderation in that market weve heard that as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for the color thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey jerry can you give us a little bit of help on the trust in investment management and deposit service charges what youre thinking there theyre a little better than i thought it would be but just give us some thinking on what you see there for an outlook jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure i guess for the quarter ill be honest on the trust in investment management fees i was pleasantly surprised that we ended up what we did and what we saw was that we had a good month and excuse me a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 good quarter in oil and gas fees they were up about a million quarteroverquarter so compared to second quarter last year so they really were able to offset a decrease that we saw in investment fees which were down million and i think our excuse me yeah about million state fees down another million so i dont i would expect that given all the volatility and whats going on in the markets that well see some pressure on that investment line item we have continued to grow our managed accounts in that business i think were up in numbers of accounts compared to the second quarter last year so i know theres a lot of focus on trying to grow the business but we will we are feeling some pressure given the volatility in the market on deposit service charges its interesting weve made in my opinion some changes that have really been i think made a lot of sense for us and for our customers on overdraft fees when we instituted overdraft grades and then here recently in june what we did was previously to get that overdraft you had to have a direct deposit of at least a month and after our retail team did some work we felt like that was punitive to some of our customers given the fact that not every employer pays the direct deposit and so we lifted that in june and were saying thats probably going to cost us million so we havent seen the impact of that this additional change that we made and then weve also eliminated our nsf fees which were about million if i remember correctly so well see where that line item is going to see some pressure going forward but really a lot of our growth as phil has talked about the number of new accounts that weve been able to bring on where we expected some of those some pressure on that line item its really been offset by increases of numbers of transactions just given the increases in the number of customers jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good that kind of segues to my next question just the in the new households alltime high is that how are you doing in your legacy markets on that and how how much of that is driven by the new markets phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc jon one thing id guess id offer up to you is if you look at just account openings from traditional branches which you can include everything which is mostly legacy right account growth yearoveryear from traditional branches was so id say were doing pretty good and i think it all revolves around a lot of things that are working for us i think our value proposition is solid we give people square deal and great service i mean you dont always have to be looking over your shoulder oh gee i wonder what my banks paying anything or are they paying anything on the deposit to me we put in a lot of work every week jerrys looking at the market where you go were talking to our lines of business were trying to figure out whats fair its just a lot of things working for us and our branch experience is i think is unparalleled in terms of what we do not just the way people are treated and dealt with but just the physical facilities are beautiful and they just create a great experience so the other thing i talked about this last time really think it was interesting what happened with this location that we opened up in the west part of san antonio thats a legacy market there was one weve been in years and the growth weve seen in that particular location was literally multiples of what we did in our best houston location in the first six months lets say of its life its already at yeah its already million in deposits in six seven months i mean so and thats just the legacy market where you open the location so theres something going on that i hope we can continue to leverage and then i feel good i feel good i feel good about the way the whole business is operating and how were moving forward just running a business cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah this is my last earnings call of the quarter and i think i might be last in the queue so maybe ill add this in the quarter but you used the terms unusual and evolving in your phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc opening comments and ive asked this on other calls but there seems to be a disconnect between credit quality that were seeing from the banks and then what we see them to see and read about every day and whats your take on where were evolving to are you worried about it is texas different it sounds like youre not seeing erosion in your loan book but just any big picture thoughts on whether the markets right or youre right or where are we going phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think its a great question jon and ill tell you a disconnect that we are sort of seeing is yeah when we talk to customers on main street i mean theres not a lot of talk about slowing you know theres not a lot of talk about recession theres talk about where am i going to get the next person to hire what on earth am i going to have to pay them and whats the next bubble in the supply chain and how can i get the capacity to the warehouse what i can get so that im ready to move forward when i can get the other parts of the supply chain that i need i mean i think main street is those are the things that they are dealing with and how they feel about their business is different than when they go home at night and sit on the couch and watch the news and hear discussions about the economy at least in the markets that were operating in now there are some that as admittedly are slowing if youre dependent on developing a deal thats two years away from being finished and you dont know what rates are going to be or what the economy is going to be theres some slow there theres some slowing more circumspection there but the economy is strong here and you know im not too worried about its direction right now but it is unusual and evolving because the feds increasing rate basis points at a time and well see what impact that has over time jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thanks guys i appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay jon thanks jerry
