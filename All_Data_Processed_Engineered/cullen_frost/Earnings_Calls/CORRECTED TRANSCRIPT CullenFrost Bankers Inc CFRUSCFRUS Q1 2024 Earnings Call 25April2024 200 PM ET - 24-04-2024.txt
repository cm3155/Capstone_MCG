cullenfrost bankers inc thanks ab good afternoon everyone thanks for joining us today ill review the first quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will provide additional comments before we open it up to your questions in the first quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter of last year in the first quarter results were affected by an additional fdic insurance surcharge accrual of million or a share associated with the bank failures that happened in early our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were and respectively and that compared with and for the same period last year the solid earnings from the first quarter demonstrate the success of our organic growth strategy and the hard work of our bankers our strength and stability combined with our core values and strong corporate culture allow us to continue providing worldclass service to our customers which results in sustained longterm growth our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remained consistently strong also as was the case in previous quarters cullenfrost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing access any broker deposits or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangements to build uninsured deposit percentages and additionally our available for sale securities represented more than of our portfolio at year end at quarter end average deposits in the first quarter were billion down from the billion in the first quarter of last year average loans grew to billion in the first quarter compared with billion in the quarter a year ago we continue to see excellent results in our organic growth program for example we combined our houston locations with expansion we stand at deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal for the dallas market expansion we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal just after the first quarter close we opened the second new location on our site austin expansion project our new our next new austin region location will open just after memorial day at the end of the first quarter our overall expansion efforts had generated billion in deposits billion in loans and added over new households and it helps me to put this in perspective when i remember that the largest acquisition in our history was a company with billion in deposits our consumer banking business continues to build momentum from the 2023s record net new household growth and we added net new checking accounts or households to the quarter and we had an annual growth rate there of which we believe continues to put us among the top growing banks in the country average consumer loans saw steady growth in the first quarter increasing an annualized on a linked quarter basis and hit a milestone of billion in average balances outstanding and we remain excited about the prospects for our new mortgage product which is approaching loans with about half coming in the first quarter looking at our commercial business on a linked quarter basis average loan balances increased an annualized for ci and increase for cre our new commitments booked in the first quarter were less than the level booked in the first quarter of our new commercial relationships were up year overyear and at represented our highest level of first quarter relationships ever this coincided with us achieving our highest level ever for calling activity in the first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 new loan opportunities in our pipeline were up yearoveryear and were second only to the last years spike after svbs failure our weighted average pipeline stood at billion up by from the fourth quarter and by from the first quarter last year and regarding those new relationships in the first quarter that i mentioned about half of those continue to come from the toobigtofail banks we continue to use discretion as we look at our new loan opportunities and as an example i point out that in the first quarter our deals lost were up by yearoveryear and of those deals lost were due to structure credit quality is good by historical standards with net chargeoffs and net and new nonaccrual loans at healthy levels were seeing some normalization in credit risk ratings and we as we come off the historic lows and problems experienced in the years immediately following the pandemic and looking at some of the details net chargeoffs for the first quarter were million compared to million last quarter and million a year ago annualized net chargeoffs for the first quarter represented basis points for periodend loans nonperforming assets totaled million at the end of the first quarter compared to million last quarter and million a year ago the quarter end figure represents just basis points of periodend loans and basis points of total assets problem loans which we define as riskgrade or oaem totaled million at the end of the first quarter and thats up from million at the end of the fourth quarter and million at the same time last year three quarters of the increase was due to companyspecific ci loans with the remainder being cre credits of various types and this growth in first quarter was fairly evenly split between loans in the oaem or risk grade and classified or riskgrade categories and was mainly attributable to a few larger credits some of which we expect relatively quick resolutions for less than of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real estate about are related to ci credits with most of the balance in owner occupied real estate which of course related to ci loans regarding commercial real estate lending our overall portfolio remained stable with steady operating performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values within this portfolio what we consider to be the major categories of investor cre office multifamily retail and industrial for example totaled about billion or of total cre loans outstanding our investor cre portfolio has held up well with the average performance metrics stable quarteroverquarter exhibiting an overall average loan to value at underwriting of about and average weighted debt service coverage ratio of about the investor office portfolio specifically had a balance of million at quarter end and that portfolio exhibited an average loan to value of healthy occupancy levels and an average debt service coverage ratio of which is slightly improved for the second consecutive quarter our comfort level with the office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors and the predominantly class a nature of our office building projects in our last conference call i mentioned that we had just introduced a new prospect marketing campaign and brand refresh designed to emphasize our great customer experiences we saw the proof points of that in the first quarter when frost achieved the highest scores nationwide and the greenwich excellence award for the 8th consecutive year and the highest ranking for banking customer satisfaction in texas in jd powers retail banking satisfaction study for the 15th consecutive year these are unprecedented achievements no other bank can say those things and i hope no other bank ever will but when you think about it that level of service is what our customers have come to expect from frost its what we deliver on a daily basis and its what we mean when we talk in the new campaign about real life examples of extraordinary customer service with the description exactly what you unexpected and none of this is cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 possible without the dedication of our employees across texas their commitment to our culture and their optimistic spirit make all of our successes possible and im proud of everything that our frost teams are accomplishing across all our communities and now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil let me start off by giving some additional color on our overall expansion results as phil mentioned we continue to be very pleased with the volume weve been able to achieve looking at the first quarter growth in both average loans and deposits was approximately when compared to the previous quarter and for the first quarter the profitability of the houston expansion offset the costs associated with the additional expansion efforts in dallas and austin now moving to our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter some positives for the quarter include higher volumes for both loans and balances at the fed and higher yields on loans and investment securities these positives were partially offset by higher cost of interestbearing deposits compared to the fourth quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the first quarter down million from the fourth quarter during the first quarter investment purchases totaled million with million of that being agency nbs securities and million in municipal the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion an increase of million from the billion reported at the end of the fourth quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the first quarter was up basis points from the fourth quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion down approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our taxexempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the first quarter up about million from the fourth quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis point from the prior quarter at the end of the first quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was years up from years at the end of the fourth quarter looking at deposits on a linked quarter basis average total deposits of billion were down million or from the previous quarter we did continue to see a shift a mix shift during the first quarter as average noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased million or while interestbearing deposits increased million or when compared to the previous quarter based on first quarter average balances noninterestbearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were compared to in the fourth quarter the cost of interestbearing deposits in the first quarter was up basis points from in the fourth quarter looking at april monthtodate averages for total deposits through yesterday they are up about million from our first quarter average of billion with interestbearing up million and noninterestbearing down million monthtodate customer repos for the first quarter averaged billion basically flat with the fourth quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was up basis point from the fourth quarter in the month of april average balance per customer repos was down approximately million from the first quarter average cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 looking at noninterest income expense on a linked quarter basis ill point out a couple of items trust and investment management fees were down million or impacted by lower estate fees down million estate fees can be lumpy as theyre based on the value and number of estates settled insurance commissions and fees were up million or property and casualty and benefit company bonuses which are typically received in the first quarter contributed million to the increase benefit commissions were up million as the first quarter is typically the strongest quarter for those commissions as a reminder the second quarter is typically the weakest quarter for insurance commissions and fees given our typical yearly renewal cycle the other noninterest income category was down million primarily related to million in cardrelated incentives as those incentives are received in the fourth quarter each year and a million fourth quarter recovery of a previous loss accrual salaries and wages were up million as increased salaries and higher incentive accruals were mostly offset by stock compensation expense which was lower by million as a reminder our stock awards are granted in october of each year and some awards by their nature require immediate expense recognition benefits expense was up million impacted by higher payroll taxes and 401k expenses related to annual bonuses paid during the first quarter and impacted by the normal trend for fica taxes and 401k limits reset at the beginning of the year other noninterest expense was down million or the decrease was driven primarily by donations expense which was down million and professional services was down million regarding our guidance for full year our current projections include two 25basispoint cuts for the fed funds rate over the remainder of with one cut in september and another one in november this is down from five cuts in our january guidance for the full year of we currently expect full year average loan growth in the high single digits thats up from our previous guidance of growth in the midtohigh single digits full year average deposit growth in the range of flat to thats down from our previous guidance of growth in the range of to net interest income growth in the range of to that has not changed from our previous guidance with the net interest margin percentage expected to trend slightly upward each quarter for the remainder of the year noninterest income could be flat to up impacted by the pressure facing the industry on interchange revenues and od fees and also impacted by our high level of sundry income in that represents a slight improvement from our previous guidance of basically flat noninterest expense growth in the range of to on a reported basis this has not changed from our previous guidance regarding net chargeoffs we still expect those to go up to a more normalized historical level of to basis points of average loans regarding taxes our effective tax rate for the full year of was and we currently expect a comparable effective rate in no change to this guidance with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry well now open up the call for questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from casey haire with jefferies please proceed casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good afternoon everyone i guess start starting off with the nii guide so you guys are leaving it intact despite you getting less cuts the loan growth sounds like its coming in a little bit stronger than even your revised high single digit guide so i guess its just its the higher funding cost pressure thats keeping it intact just a little more color on the nii dynamics jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its certainly some of that and also were talking about higher for longer as weve talked about the competitive field out here for deposits i think the higher that the longer that rates stay higher i think well continue to see more pressure on deposits weve been talking obviously for a while now about customers looking for a higher yield and i think that pressure will just continue we continue to see that especially in the noninterest bearing side where people are continuing to move their deposits we continue to see a little bit downward trend there and i think just the uncertainty there is going to make us just stay with our original guidance even given the cuts the reduction of a couple of cuts casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and maybe just following up on that so what does your nii guide assume in terms of dda mix i believe its it fell to and then what about betas from here jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the betas is really at this point were not assuming because we dont have any rate hikes in them were not assuming any significant movements in the betas i think our cumulative beta weve got if i remember correctly we were at a and we moved up to id expect that wed have that sort of potential pressure were not seeing a lot of movement in the interestbearing the nontime accounts we tweaked some downward actually a little bit so at this point you may see that same sort of increase of quarteroverquarter but i dont expect that to change drastically of course well continue to keep an eye on whats going on in the market i dont hear nearly as much crazy cd pricing as we heard call it four or five six months ago but theres still some stuff out there going on so from that standpoint i expect some pressure on the beta but i dont expect it to change significantly casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and the dda mix of it sounds like theres more pressure just wondering how much more cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i would think that yeah i would think there will continue to be pressure there i dont expect it to i expect that it would move down a little bit but i dont expect a drastic change at this point you kind of heard the movement that we have in that category was down a couple of hundred million yeartodate and as a reminder for us the first half of the year historically and maybe these are not historical times but historically the first half of the year is always softer for us on dda and so thats not really unusual to us i think i mentioned in the january call we were already seeing dda down call it million between the time of the call compared to the fourth quarter average i think what we continue to do is we just continue to be focused on growing relationships you know i think we really feel very comfortable with what were doing the successes that are being reported out there and well just continue to keep plugging along with that theres not a lot we can do these customers are looking for higher averages and were going to do what we can but i would expect back to your question i would expect there might be a little bit of pressure for that to go down a little bit as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc maybe to start sort of followup on caseys question on nii jerry last quarter i thought you said that nii up to i was assuming five rate cuts but if we didnt get any cuts we would add like to that increase is it still the same if we get no cuts this year do you think it would have above or has that potential improvement lessened now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know it probably lessened a little bit now part of it again is when were talking this whole conversation is about the noninterestbearing deposits and obviously thats a big impact on that number so given what the pressure that we saw there a little bit more than we expected in the first quarter and as i responded on the previous question not really ready to increase our guidance its really more related what happens there and i think that will really drive a lot of it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 the month of april like i said doesnt look unusually bad and its a little tough to really address all of this because for us from a cyclical standpoint this is where we would typically be wed be a little bit softer and weve kind of said that for a while now that the first half of the year will be softer so at this point were well just kind of have to see where it plays out but yeah i think the big swing factor is what happens with those dda balance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then thank you on the loan growth side you guys had solid loan growth and really in the quarter where the industry has not much loan growth to speak of at all how much of the loan growth is coming from current customers borrowing more really a sign of the health of the markets versus just pure market share gains like new customers to the bank phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know steven i dont have that number at hand i can tell you what some of the new customers have done to loan growth if jerry can help me out with that but just to talk a little bit about it the it was interesting that a lot of the activity we saw in pipeline increase is was customer related and as opposed to prospect so i think that was interesting and i think also an area that we saw is that core loan growth the under million relationships i think its the activity there was better than the large loan deals and i think that reflects our expansion growth and so its pretty broadly based and so thats what youre seeing one second i might be able to steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc just looking for the new relationship impact jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i guess what id say is from the numbers that im looking at it looks like maybe about lets talk about the period end growth between december and march about a quarter of it im going to say is related to new customers steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and while indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc so i just steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 go ahead phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc see i did find what i was looking for in the first quarter we added million in new loan balances and million in deposits from new relationships over the last months steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats about a quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc about a quarter yeah part of the reason i asked you know even though the industry has fairly modest growth this quarter quite a few banks are coming out pretty bullish as seeing pipelines build and you guys already up low double digit in terms of yearoveryear on loan growth jerry i know you said high single digit but if youre seeing the same pipeline build it would seem that puts you in a pretty good position to maybe even do better than high single digit do you just want to be conservative here jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know i think i guess if youre asking could it move up to the low double digits i think what were hearing in some of it is we could obviously but just hearing some of the conversations with the regional presidents i mean there is a little bit of slowness going out there some of this growth is coming from commitments that were originated last year so although everybody is still pretty bullish theres a little bit still of concern about what happens through the rest of the year so could it happen yeah i mean the numbers are trending really well both on a linked quarter and a yearoveryear i think we were both of them were north of so we could kind of tweak up into instead of a could we be at a or certainly but again we are getting we are hearing a little bit of word of caution from some of our guys out in the field steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc steven id say there are a couple of forces or there are a few forces that are on the positive side some are on the negative i just talked to some of our people about how it looks theyve just done some calls yesterday got back from it and their opinion was that theyre seeing good activity and there is kind of a bifurcation of the high end of the markets doing really well and some of the low end is under some pressure but so those offset themselves a little bit but activity is good but were also being careful on what were seeing in structure like i said we lost of the deals lost were in structure i think as we see some of the banks getting back in the game theyre getting cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 back to where they were before i guess and a little bit more aggressive than wed like to be so that will be a little bit of a limiter on us if the market gets out of hand but overall i think its got a good outlook and one of the reasons is because that pipeline information that i showed you as i mentioned a few minutes ago just the growth in the linked quarter pipeline with strong the number of new relationships are strong so were doing well competitively and i think the market in texas is still reasonably good i think jerry is right some people are continue to be a little bit circumspect around the election probably might impact what some people are willing to do until we get the lay of the land regulatorily what theyre going to be looking at but i would and i probably felt that a little bit more cautious last quarter but interestingly what ive heard recently has been pretty good steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay sounds good thanks for all the color jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys back on the nii guide i was just wondering what your assumptions are for liquidity trends youre baking into that it sounds like you made some securities purchases this quarter is the plan to grow that book some from here to reduce some of that cash and take some of the asset sensitivity off the table and if you have those purchase yields on those different segments that would be great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure yeah on the let me give you those purchase yields first i got those right here so in the agencies we bought at a and the municipals at a te what were doing right now is i dont see liquidity moving very much during the year loan growth has obviously been better than we expected we have been targeting investment purchases of about billion is i think the guidance that id given billion billion for the year were talking about scaling that back somewhat part of it is we just want to continue to be opportunistic in this environment and so youll probably see us i dont know if that will affect the liquidity number much but im thinking that we probably wont reach that number this year well probably be a few hundred million shy of that like i said loan growth has been better deposits like i said a little bit softer than we expected even in that on the noninterestbearing side so all things being equal i think the netnet of it is you wont see a whole lot of change in the liquidity and if there is a bias its probably a small bias to increasing that somewhat david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 yeah okay and then just on your comment of less nii upside in a higher for longer type of scenario i was just curious where that nii sensitivity is now on delaying a cut i think last quarter you mentioned something like roughly million of benefit each month what is that now roughly jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think a lot of it depends on timing when we look at it again the cuts that weve got in our models are in the second part of the year and so again depending on whats happening with balances at the fed id say that number is probably and again assuming they happen later in the year its probably closer to a million a month benefit david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and maybe switch jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc on a pretax basis david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah pretax okay great and then on just credit you mentioned maybe if i heard this right a few larger credits impacting the problem loan trends this quarter i was just hoping to get some detail on those and then where are you on your office reserve ratio at this point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay well let me take the question with regard to the increased problem loans with a riskgrade and higher as i said it was enduse industry or company specific related there was and ive talked about some of these before theres a large construction company that had missed some bids in the one segment theyre looking for actively looking for a refinance now but we need to recognize at a riskgrade in the interim period there was a factoring company that we increased to riskgrade just because of some perspective on borrowing base computation et cetera we decided were not all on the same page and that was one of them there was a truck hauler we saw have some issues with regard to volume there was a company that moved into a brandnew facility a fairly significant facility theyre getting used to that they had an operating loss in the near term as they moved that over so we need to recognize that until they turned that around those are the things they are theyre more like i said company specific theyre not really so much interest rate related except for the things that relate to used cars primarily the buy here pay here dealers thats true both the consumer on the car side and also on the trucking side thats the closest thing to an interest rate impact that weve seen since weve had some of that but thats not new for us weve been talking about that for the last two quarters but thats the kind of thing that were seeing david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc appreciate the color and then just on the office reserve ratio at this point if theres any update there cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure yeah what you will see in the 10q is we dont give a very detailed view there i think the commercial real estate reserve coverage is like at a but what some of what we do with the overlays just to give you a little bit of the inside baseball there is that for and this is for nonowner occupied and construction office office buildings that are in construction so the highest or the best or the worst i guess i should say pastgrade credits that we give them a reserve and then anything worse than that so if you start getting into a which is a watch and a and worse they actually get a reserve so as i look at these numbers on a combined basis that brings me and this again this is on the investor office and any office buildings under construction that combined reserve would be at a is what im showing david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks for all the color guys appreciate it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from peter winter with da davidson please proceed peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co thanks good afternoon i just wanted to so if i could follow up on the problem loan discussion just if were in this higher for longer rate environment because i heard your comments that these arent interest rate related yet but the longer that were in this higher for longer rate environment do you see more pressure on like ci loans and continued increases in the problem loans sector phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc peter i dont see anything thats significant or a trend for the higher for longer on the ci piece to be honest i think that again with the exception of some of the auto dealers that i talked about who are in portfolios credit and having some issues there i dont really see that so much i think the impact is going to be more on real estate commercial real estate and what people what they were financing at before and where they are today and those things are going to have to be solved by borrowers and sponsors coming in and supporting their projects when they come to maturity and so far weve had really good experience and really good performance by our borrowers but we could create scenarios where interest rates went higher if we need more pressure but were not seeing that right now peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 okay and then just separately the insurance commissions it had really nice growth in it was up almost but the first quarter yearoveryear it was down is there anything unusual this quarter or just how are you looking at that on a full year basis jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the one thing ill say on the comparison to a year ago so the first quarter of last year had a very strong life insurance commission so we were probably unfavorable this quarter in that comparison by about million and so the commissions on those policies are just one time youre in a onetime fee its not like benefit commissions or property and casualty that tend to be a little bit more of an annuity so that was a little bit lumpy that was probably the biggest thing that affect us affected us negatively compared to the first quarter last year although ill say that the benefits commissions were softer than i expected as well peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks jerry jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from catherine mealor with kbw please proceed catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a question on expenses i know that you left your expense guidance unchanged at the to growth rate yearoveryear curious i know you mentioned that fica taxes and some kind of seasonality drove the higher expenses this quarter should we assume that we kind of fall back from this first quarter level as we go into the second quarter and then grow from there or do you still think you grow from this run rate into next quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think a couple of things ill say is that we did get the additional surcharge of million right from the fdic that we didnt know anything about when we gave the guidance in january and weve been really trying to run a tight ship here in this first quarter on expenses again we are certainly impacted by the expansion that were doing and so we kept our guidance the same even though we were basically saw an additional almost million in expenses that we hadnt expected and your question was a little muffled but i think i heard you say that maybe the first quarter was higher from the benefits maybe i think benefits tends to go down during the year a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 lot of it has to do with things like 401k contributions matches that we have to make or payroll tax matches in certain cases employees want especially on the 401k side they reached that limit pretty quickly intentionally or unintentionally and so then our we match up to if they reach that level then the match stops and same thing for the fica after they reach a certain level of course there is no more contribution there but so it will the benefits will go down certainly just trend wise i dont see the trajectory that we have other than if you take the million out i would expect that youll see a little bit of growth quarteroverquarter in expenses based on what were seeing today but like i said i feel good about where were at i think weve done a good job this first quarter and continue to try to do that but i would expect that they will continue to go up just a little bit quarteroverquarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats helpful and to be clear that to includes the million fdic assessment jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc exactly yeah we just we assumed its operating if you will for those purposes so the million is in the number in because its on an as reported and the million number is included in our numbers catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then next question on fee service charges it seasonally also is usually lower in the first quarter but i know youve talked about interchange and some other things being softer in the first quarter so would you expect that to also ramp or increase as we go into the next couple of quarters or is this also a good kind of lower run rate for service charges jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that the thing with service charges the upside to it has been the commercial service charges in some cases it works against you right because in some cases customers may hold decide pay more for services through hard dollar charges rather than through keeping the balances so thats some of that and so thats been impacting the growth but weve done a lot of things i will say in favor of the customer as it relates to especially on the consumer side on od fees and we continue to see good growth there but a lot of it as phil mentioned were just growing those accounts pretty significantly and i really kind of try to say that i dont expect those are going to grow and obviously theres some guidance out there potentially a lot of pressure that on those fees so weve really been i will say in some ways pleasantly surprised but i dont see that having a lot of growth from where we are today i think it will just be continue to be pressure in that category for the rest of is kind of the numbers that im seeing right now catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc very helpful thank you operator our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask about deposit pressure and most banks spoke about how deposit pressure eased in the first quarter do you think theres something related to your specific customer mix or the fact that you are accelerating growth in new markets what do you think is driving that incremental pressure on deposit cost for you guys relative to what were seeing in the broader market jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc from a cost standpoint i will say that were really not feeling from a market standpoint not feeling a lot of pressure on the deposit cost side we need to be competitive and we are i think weve got to we decided were competing primarily on the 90day cd its really more of the pressure is coming on the noninterestbearing and i think it really just continues to be the scenario where rates at these higher levels continues to put pressure both on commercial customers and consumer customers looking for balances i will say that when we look at the balances especially on the interestbearing side and its true i think both in consumer and commercial is that we have seen increases in from february to march small increases and then march to april as well on that interestbearing side so i think competitively pricing wise i think things are going right i think historically like i said our balances just tend to be softer in this first quarter but were going to compete on the pricing were not going to be the highest weve never intended to be the highest but we do keep an eye on whats going on there and we make decisions obviously on where we want to compete but as i said earlier were not seeing a lot of pressure on what ill call the interest bearing but noncds if you will so the mma specifically not seeing a lot of pressure there yet competitively so we really havent moved those rates for a while now manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe on the loan side you spoke about the deals lost being up because of structure where are you seeing this competition coming from is it private credit is it other banks and is part of the reason for maybe the weakness in nim because youre skewing to higher quality and lower yielding loans right now phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc the first part of your question id say its mainly banks that were seeing structure and its the same old story you know its guarantees its loan to values its terms all of that so theres some of that i dont know were it could be certainly visavis private credit where were getting a lower yields than theyre able to achieve but albeit with higher risk in their case but youre probably going to see that weve got a little bit lower yield on average but not by a lot because we tend to be on the higher quality piece of the credit curve cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and if i could just have a clarification on one of your comments on the security side i think you said the duration on that book was up about year to years is that entirely from the move up in rates or are you taking on a little bit more duration to lock in the benefits of higher rates jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no like i said we really didnt do a lot of purchases in the first quarter i think some of it was that we had about billion in treasuries that were at the end of the year lets say call it million of it that were maturing the first few days of january so that was affecting it and i think there might have been there might be a little bit more extended duration on the mortgaged backs but we havent added a whole lot of duration with anything that weve done in the first quarter manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon guys a couple of questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc phil should we expect the potential problem loans to continue to migrate higher or is that not necessarily true phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jon the first of all ill say problem loans right the old potential problem loans is a category that we dont usually but in the riskgrade and higher should we expect the increase i would say maybe and the reason id say that is because we were at such low levels really the industry is at unsustainably low levels coming out of the pandemic for credit quality right and so were still not where we are i would say normally and so but we are seeing some what i would call some reversion to mean so that would tell me yeah we probably ought to expect it to go up some at the same time some of these that weve added were looking for some reasonably quick turnarounds on them i mean were just trying to be realistic with these risk grades that were adding and then its not a death sentence or anything its just recognizing that we perceive some elevated risk but we do work on them and work to get to correcting the companies work to correct cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 and so im hopeful that with some of these that we brought on this time well see them move out but we could also see some more move in because again were really coming off a really unsustainably low level so thats why i say maybe im not concerned with credit quality i mean i know im paid to worry as frost banker and so i guess theres that part of me thats always going to be concerned with it but i think credit quality is good i mean weve spent a lot of time looking at our commercial real estate portfolio and very granular level and ill tell you that probably if somebody said austin office building they would run for the hills but i would tell you i think our austin office building portfolio is solid man i have looked at the ive looked at the multifamily deals people would say oh man austin its got a reduction in the interest rates the housing prices come off got a lot of supply coming on et cetera et cetera but i look at our multifamily in the austin market i feel great about and so it depends on the deal it depends on your sponsors how theyre operating as far as the austin house prices being down they were up of the two years before that right so i mean theres this headline stuff i mean if you really look below it and you spend time on it i mean i feel great about the commercial real estate portfolio for us our people have done a heck of a job underwriting it and part of the reason i feel great is the same reason that we lost of the deals to structure this quarter our folks know how to book these things that doesnt mean we wont have problems and ive talked to you about some that have popped up and all but its not something that gives me any worry i think its interesting whats happening with the company specific stuff on the ci side were going to see well continue to see things pop up there and some of these guys may not be able to solve their problems but most of them will but thats just banking its a risk business and i really think we have a handle on it and anyway just felt the need to say that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah yeah so it doesnt sound like you guys feel the need to build reserves from here i mean i hear your chargeoff guidance and i respect that but it doesnt feel like you have more pressure coming at least in your mind in terms of credit phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i dont feel that way now i mean jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know can we see it get worse sure it can jerry can speak to the formula better than i can but i think we feel really good about where the reserve is today and i think another thing i might say about the reserve as you might recall we built it up there during that covid period and we never took it out and so i think it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think thats a little bit different than others yeah we pretty much stayed there and we really havent if you look at our reserve coverage percentage it really hasnt moved around very much and i wouldnt expect that it will its going to move a couple of basis points here and there but i dont envision at this point any significant reason that we would see that reserve number increasing again if youre assuming a pretty normal sort of credit quality environment jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay jerry as long as you have the mic you changed the presentation of the expansion contribution for the quarter what if you can share what kind of contribution did houston have this quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think it was last time we rounded to but let me make sure i was going to say i think we rounded to this quarter but let me just check thats exactly right they were last quarter this quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and when you say houston is funding dallas and austin thats and is that right together jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc correct yeah i would just netted the two and i was trying to keep it simple maybe i confused you but yeah houston together is funding the other expansion that was really as we had talked about this and planning it out that was certainly the way we hoped things were going to work out that as these financial centers began to mature they would begin to pay for the future expansions and it certainly worked out that way jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah well thats great those are great numbers so okay thank you i appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you one comment ill make that catherine had asked about expenses and one thing i wanted to clarify and i made a comment in my comments about the linked quarter in salaries so for us a lot of the stock awards are given in october and so they do affect the fourth quarter and so typically salaries for us are higher in that fourth quarter and because by their nature a lot of these stock awards immediately vest and as a result they are immediately expensed so i think if you looked at the growth in salaries expense between the third quarter and fourth quarter last year youll get some sort of an expectation wise what you might expect to see between the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year just to give a little bit of a better color there so operator in the interest of time were going to ask that you please limit to one question and one followup question our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon just phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc one very quick one jerry for you around the securities book sorry if i missed this should we expect one the securities portfolio to grow from average levels or stay flat and second could you confirm i think you mentioned you have another billion of securities that you expect to buy what the pickup in the yield is on the investment versus whats rolling off thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure yeah i would expect all things being equal we may be down a little bit but its going to be relatively flat were expecting cash flow i think of about billion and the weighted yield of those are about a and thats impacted somewhat weve got million that doesnt mature until the fourth quarter and those are some treasury securities at basis points and right now i think some of you heard kind of what we were buying we i would expect that if youre talking about something in the versus that rounded youve got some nice pickup potential there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so does that imply jerry that nii should keep growing from the first quarter levels as we move through the year and fourth quarter will probably see a lift again from the securities yield going higher jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats kind of what i would expect yeah that the net interest income is on a little bit of a positive trajectory i think for us the low was probably last year sometime in the i would say the second first second or third quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc perfect thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc we should we are kind of expecting small pickups for the rest of the quarters moving forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2024 got it thank you operator we have reached the end of
