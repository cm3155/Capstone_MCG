quarter last year and million or a share in the second quarter of this year our return on average assets and average common equity in the third quarter were and respectively these results and our overall growth show that our investments in our strategy of sustainable organic growth are paying off and that our company is well positioned to succeed loan growth continue to be strong and above our longterm expectation of highsingle digits annual growth average loans excluding ppp in the third quarter were billion or higher level than the average loans of billion in the third quarter of on an annualized linkedquarter basis loans excluding ppp increased by little over yearoveryear growth in the portfolio was broadbased with about third coming from our ci component about half coming from commercial real estate and the remainder coming from consumer real estate we booked about billion in new commercial commitments in the third quarter and this was up from a year ago and down from the second quarter the drop was mainly from larger deals as core commitments were more in line with the previous quarter looking at our pipeline gross pipeline is basically flat from the last quarter down and on a weighted basis its down overall deposit growth was strong and we invested in our depositor relationships by doing the right thing and allowing increased interest rates to flow through to our customers average deposits in the third quarter were billion an increase of compared to the third quarter of last year and up on an annualized basis over the previous quarter we continue to see great growth in our consumer banking business average consumer loans were billion in the third quarter up by over the third quarter last year and up an unannualized compared to the previous quarter this is primarily from our consumer real estate products of heloc home equity and home improvement the outlook for these loans continues to be good and credit strong growth in new households continues in the third quarter we put on new households that was higher than the same quarter a year ago our total household count of over in the third quarter was over the record level in all organic regarding our branch expansion efforts our houston expansion branches have produced right at billion of deposits with loans of million and over new households and they continue to exceed pro forma in dallas we opened the sixth of our planned new locations earlier this month and we expect to open four more new locations before the end of this year we are very encouraged by the preliminary results of the new sites which have achieved of deposit goals of loan goals and of new household goals now before anyone asks yes we did set meaningful goals for our new locations as we said before those goals are based on the average of what we had achieved with the locations that we had opened in the eight years prior to our houston expansion strategy as i mentioned the new houston locations are above goal and the new dallas branches are performing even better than that our team that is building our new mortgage loan process is preparing to launch its pilot program cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 with an eye on rolling out our new mortgage loans on a wider basis in stages beginning late this year and early next year it has been exciting to watch as we create an entire process to originate and service mortgage loans in keeping with the frost philosophy and our core values of integrity caring and excellence overall credit quality remains good the september number for total delinquencies excluding ppp was million or basis points of total loans the total problem loan level which we define as risk grade and higher totaled million at the end of the third quarter down from million at the end of the second quarter the favorable rate of problem resolutions that we began seeing late last year via payoffs payments and upgrades continued to the third quarter totaling million todate once again we did not report a credit loss expense in the third quarter and net chargeoffs for the quarter were million which compares favorably with the million in the second quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the third quarter remained at basis points of average loans which is below our typical longterm level nonaccrual loans were million at the end of the third quarter and that represented a decrease from million at the end of the second quarter you may remember that in our second quarter conference call i reported that we had achieved our goal of mid single digit concentration level in the energy portfolio and im happy to report that weve stuck to our goal with energy loans excluding ppp representing of loans at the end of the third quarter and speaking of ppp loans we knew that when that process began helping our customers get their loans forgiven would be as important as helping them get their applications approved and our teams have done a magnificent job on both ends of the process and more than of our borrowers are through the process now and the way that we help borrowers get emergency loans to stay in business and then get through the ppp forgiveness process is going to pay dividends for our customer relationships for many many years all of this together demonstrates that we have strategies and systems in place to allow us to succeed in all economic environments we believe in doing the right thing for our customers and it isnt just words its backed up by the investments in time resources and personnel that we make with things like our industryleading rates on deposit accounts building a worldclass mortgage loan process from start to finish providing overdraft grace early payday 24hour customer assistance days a week and expanding our presence so that we can extend the frost value proposition to people across texas all that takes hard work and id like to thank our people for being a force for good in everyday lives and now ill turn the call over to our cfo jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter our yields on both balances held at the fed and loans had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage the increase was also positively impacted to a much lesser extent by higher yields on investment securities and by higher volumes of both investment securities and loans these positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs on deposits and repurchase agreements looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter up billion from the second quarter average as we continued to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion which included about million in treasuries yielding about a million in agency mbs securities with a yield of about and about million in municipal securities with the taxable equivalent yield of about our current expectation is that we would invest an additional billion of our excess liquidity into investment purchases in the fourth quarter or about billion net of projected inflows the taxable equivalent yield on the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 total investment portfolio was in the third quarter up basis points from the second quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up billion from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the third quarter up about million from the second quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the third quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was years down from years at the end of the second quarter looking at deposits on a linkedquarter basis average deposits were up billion or on an annualized basis average total noninterest bearing deposits were up million or on an annualized basis from the second quarter excluding public funds those deposits would have been up million or on an annualized basis the linkedquarter growth in deposits has come primarily from growth in average interest bearing deposits which were up million or on an annualized basis the cost of interestbearing deposits for the quarter was basis points up basis points from the second quarter looking at noninterest income on a linkedquarter basis service charges on deposit accounts were down or primarily as a result of lower commercial service charges primarily resulting from a higher earnings credit rate on annualized balances insurance commissions and fees were up million or from the second quarter as a result of higher life insurance commissions which were up and also impacted by our normal business cycle which results in higher commissions on both pc and group benefits in the third quarter versus the second other charges commissions and fees were up million or from the second quarter commitment fees on unused lines of credit and money market income were both up over compared to the second quarter regarding total noninterest expenses total noninterest expense was up million or compared to the second quarter the primary driver was salaries and wages up million or primarily impacted by higher crude incentives and an increase in the number of employees as we continue to grow our business and to a lesser extent the impact of market increases which were effective in may looking at our projection of fullyear total noninterest expenses we now expect total noninterest expense for the fullyear to increase at a percentage rate in the midteens over our reported levels the effective tax rate for the third quarter was and our current expectation is that our fullyear effective tax rate should be in the range of about to but that can be affected by discrete items during the remainder of the year regarding the estimates for the fourth quarter of earnings our current projections include a basis point fed rate increase in november followed by a basis point increase in december given those rate assumptions we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates for the fourth quarter of is too low and we believe that even the highest estimate that i see as for the fourth quarter is low with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay thank you jerry we will open it up for questions now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steven phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so frost is one of the few banks that saw growth of noninterest bearing deposits in the quarter could you give more color on what drove that you are not seeing the same underlying trend most banks are seeing where theyre seeing outflows into higheryielding alternatives jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think steven if you remember the last quarter i said one of my concerns was that we might see some softness there now im going to say i continue to be somewhat concerned especially about the larger balances were seeing some movement there but so far have been able to offset that sort of reduction in balances so knock on wood i think we in our projections part of our beat was that we had more liquidity than we expected part of it being from deposits being stronger so i think that we continue to analyze those i think there is still a little bit of risk especially on those higher balances accounts but i think as phil mentioned our goal is to try to continue to provide top quality service we continue to build new relationships so were obviously adding deposits there when we look back at kind of the 12month look back at what our deposits where that growth is coming from about of it is from augmentation of our existing customers but of the growth was coming from new customers so i think its a good place to be but i continue to be concerned especially like i said about those higher balance customers steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay im hoping we could drill a little bit i got many questions on the aoci mark and the tce ratio falling below can you talk about where do you see that bottoming and when you look at the securities cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 payoff schedule whats the timing when we should start to see tangible book and tce ratio start to turn up given the payoff schedule jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think obviously most of that is going to be driven by what happens with interest rates more than payoffs to be quite honest with you if you believe kind of what the fed is saying about interest rates starting to decline in the next year or two if you will i think youll see some of that come back were aware of whats out there from a tce basis we are moving our new muni purchases to the held to maturity category were not doing a lot there but were sensitive to it we dont spend a lot of time to be quite honest with you worrying about it with liquidity at i think this morning we were still north of billion weve got a loan to deposit ratio thats pretty low so were not in the same situation as other banks are so its something that were aware of but dont really spend a lot of time worrying about it we may do some things with new purchases but to the extent of what were discussing thats really about it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc you know steven from a business point of view again notwithstanding a situation where somebody would have to monetize those unrealized losses and that would really be a situation i think we had a liquidity issue or something like that and thats not it thats not on our radar obviously in terms of because of so much liquidity we have now i am a frost banker and liquidity is always on my radar so i will say that but the economic reality is if you run a business to me and i think this is one of the things that the fed considered when they changed those rules several years ago about this marktomarket is there are tremendous natural hedges that exist in the balance sheets of regional banks with their nonmaturity deposit bases and the accounting industry doesnt even try to recognize those values and i think as you look at how balances and net interest margins operate where banks have these natural hedges i think from an economic standpoint its not something that is of concern to us that said i recognize that if a bank doesnt have liquidity to hold these things then they might be in a different situation but its not keeping us up at night steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc steven just to give you a little bit of color to answer your question specifically on right now im projecting about billion in maturities and payoffs and as you go into and such the munis really start to accelerate were only expecting about million next year but after that youre probably in the range of billion to billion for the next couple of years steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay thanks and if i could sneak one more in so the backdrop of what were hearing this quarter is most banks are only raising the rates on deposits basically when theyre forced to fund loan growth whats been the customer reception in your markets like at the ground level to you guys offering higher rates are you seeing a material acceleration of client acquisition because of that thanks cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc what i would say about client acquisition that its continued to stay i was looking at our retail numbers recently and i think i might have said that our retail numbers were up by in terms of total customer numbers and then we also saw an increase of from the third quarter of in terms of the net new customers that we had so those were really record numbers in i dont know if you remember i think we beat our alltime high before that year by so thats kept up and i think weve continued to see growth as you said earlier in deposits and i believe were seeing some more growth in the interestbearing deposits as opposed to non interest bearing indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah correct correct phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc total so i think its reflecting in those numbers and the character of the deposits that were raising i think its been understood by people in the marketplace were trying to make it better understood by improving our marketing i think we could do a better job there and were hard at work trying to do that we will do that and you know steven its i dont think weve been defensive in these races i think what our attitude has been its more offensive than it is defensive and so if you see increases in our deposit betas its because weve got the ability to do it weve got the operating leverage to do it we are making that investment in those customers and i think it just makes our franchise stronger and the trust factor greater so thats what youre seeing today when you see those betas its not really a factor of were worried its that this is kind of our time and we really want to be we dont want to be asleep at the switch we want to continue to be putting on the pressure and increasing market share phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah one last thing ill say and its really tough to analyze but its not like were saying from the work that weve done significant percentages of those deposits if youre looking at the growth in mma for example its not that money is coming out of our dda or ioc accounts so maybe or of the increase is some disintermediation between our own noninterestbearing to our interest bearing so its not like were seeing big percentages of movements there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys nice quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you dave phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc was wondering if you could just give an update on your nii expectations following the stronger trends this quarter and if you could just talk about how youre thinking about nim trajectory into and the beginning of next year if you think youll still have some solid expansion opportunity to go there thatd be great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah dave ill speak in generalities as i said were still assuming that the next whatever it is five days or such the fed is going to raise rates basis points and then again bps in december so with that sort of a trajectory i certainly would expect that our nim and our net interest income will both increase into fourth quarter we dont give guidance on until january but ill say that given what were seeing i dont see without some dramatic change in redemption rates if you will i dont see the fourth quarter being the peak on the nim i dont expect the same sort of growth in the nim percentage or dollars that we had between third and fourth excuse me second and third to occur third and fourth and going forward but i do expect from a trend standpoint that those would continue to improve david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense i think you talked about at least being up over the low in nii this year seems like that should go decently higher what do you guys thinking there now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i would say so i think that youll just see that if you guys kind of put that out their trajectorywise youre going to see that that you know if im giving you guidance that i would expect the fourth quarter to increase it really blows that low20 growth out of the water david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah that sounds good and then how are you guys thinking about deposit beta through the cycle at this point i think youd mentioned getting a total deposit beta through youre expecting and bps coming up here how are you just thinking about that through the cycle now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc we really havent changed our thought processes very much there i mean i think were kind of on the same place we may be a little bit light right now not much but as i look at right now thats kind of what were expecting that well be doing through the rest of the year david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay maybe just switching to deposits great growth this quarter it was great to see really buck the trend for the industry as you guys talked about before i was curious what the contribution was from houston and dallas i know you mentioned the billion mark for houston congrats on that just curious that if you had the starting and finishing balances for both of those markets thatd be great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the one thing i do remember top of mind ill just quote that right now because i think phil mentioned the yearoveryear growth in deposits so i think the if you look at i think we reported growth yearoveryear and i think without the expansion we would have been at and then if you look at the loan side i think that they actually provided loans indiscernible let me see if ive got it here theyve had provided of the growth in that category so i think we were up and this is excluding ppp obviously if you excluded ppp we were up and i think the expansion provide a little over of that growth so we would have been in the range without as far as the numbers period end i dont think ive got those well i can give them to you here pretty quickly you know from a deposit standpoint were close to billion as phil said david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just houston jerry jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc both combined david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc both combined jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc both combined right and our loan balances would be about million both combined operator and our next question is from john pancari with evercore isi please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good afternoon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hi john jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the back on the deposit side deposit growth overall came in better than expected this quarter and then we gave some good color on the noninterest bearing dynamics as you look at fourth quarter and into how are you thinking about positive growth trajectory from here what level of growth do you think is achievable as youre looking into specifically jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i guess what i would say is that if i looked at the linkedquarter growth if i remember correctly here and ill just grab that you know i think that weve been saying that we expect it to get softer and it has gotten softer the linkedquarter growth was an annualized if i look at year ago quarter were closer to so we are seeing softness obviously compared to where we had been historically i think the expansion is obviously helping i think that our deposit rates are obviously contributing to that as well but ill continue to say that especially for larger customers theres just going to be more options out there for customers with higher balances that we wont be able to compete with and may not want to compete with right because there are going to be some rates that dont make sense for us to pay so i would think that if i was looking at it i would think that id lean a little bit more towards the linkedquarter growth and maybe even a little softer there but again we were wrong in the third quarter it was a lot stronger than we expected but i think the second and third linkedquarter growth is kind of would be my starting point all things being equal john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks jerry thats helpful and then on the efficiency side your efficiency ratio clearly given some of your top line trends came in better than expected this quarter as well i guess in the range on a core basis how do you see that trending as you look at what do you think is a reasonable longerterm level particularly for and then separately comp expense came in a little higher this quarter how much of that was revenuedriven versus head count or branch investment phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well i would say with regard to efficiency and i know jerry gets uncomfortable providing guidance for because we just dont do it until our january calls so you guys are getting a little bit more than you would have normally got anyway but i will say that look earnings are good i mean a certain amount of this is arithmetic okay and its you guess earning asset you see the nim you can see the impact that the increase in rates has i mean thats not hard to figure out and you guys have been doing it john i know youve been doing it for a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 long long time so we expect to see the revenue piece increase i think that bodes well for efficiency ratios at the same time the reason i jumped in is that were going to continue invest in the business and im not and we arent obsessing over that ratio were going to continue to invest in id say at least three things id say four really right now one were going to invest in our people and weve been doing that using the numbers on salaries we report and then theyre pretty dramatic and theyre necessary in order to keep the best group of people here and bring new ones in so theres that were going to invest in technology weve been doing a lot of that and weve been getting better and our technology is improving all the time and the customer experience related to it is great were going to continue to invest in our physical footprint in the markets that weve decided and then weve disclosed and well look at other markets as we continue to move forward and the other thing that were going to do is were going to invest in our marketing i think you know we need to have with the value propositions weve got we need to make sure our voice is as loud as it should be in the marketplace and so now those things are going to continue to be investments and that will be on top of just any inflationary pressures so what were really looking to do as jerry and i look at the business is expand it grow it profitably make it stronger and so the efficiency ratio will be i think a derivative of all that together john pancari q analyst evercore group llc thanks so that helpful and thanks for the reminder that im old phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc were there together operator our next question is from grady sic brady gailey with kbw please proceed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah its brady good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc it looks like the last three quarters youve been growing bonds on a net basis pretty consistently a little around like billion maybe a little on top of billion per quarter sounds like thats going to be the same in the fourth quarter frost still has a lot of cash as a percentage of average earning assets so does it seem like as we look to next year the bond additions should be potentially about the same where you add about billion a quarter next year cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think brady its kind of funny phil says i was getting phil over here because he said that i was giving more sort of sort of visual if you will forwardlooking i said yeah more than the former cfo ph you would say that what i would say is that you know thats a good starting point thats what i would do if i were you part of our sensitivity obviously about giving too much guidance is were still in that planning process its communications were still having internally you heard us talking a little bit about our liquidity when we got asked the question about tangible capital so we want to think about all those things and take a look also again of you know make sure that were comfortable with sort of a prepayment and maturity assumptions weve got included in there but i think thats a really good place to start and what i would say is in the fourth quarter one thing thats a little bit different we had been buying treasury securities and right now were more focused on mortgage backs and municipals we feel like thats a better place for us right now from a risk reward standpoint i mean those yields are you know in the third quarter of what we purchased was a little bit better than the yields wed assumed obviously that helped part of our beat as well and so were seeing yields in the fourth quarter north of in those products so thats kind of what were thinking about and as we go into then well revisit what sort of a investment program we put together but i think that your start at billion a quarter is a good place to be brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i wanted to circle back on the tangible common equity ratio of it seems like you guys are not concerned about it at that level is there a level of tce that would be concerning to you guys i think the fhlb has some restrictions if you go below a certain level and some public funds account also has some restrictions if you trip a certain level so is there any tce ratio that would be concerning or do you just not care you got almost common equity tier1 so tce just doesnt matter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i dont think theres any operational concern over that number brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then my last question is just on the provision i think you guys have had coming up on two years of a zero provision the reserve ratio percentage has been coming down with the economic uncertainty out there do you think we start to see some provisioning costs in the nearterm or do you think that that reserve has room to potentially go lower and the zero provision can continue jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah brady i think thats a great question i mean thats the sort of conversations were having right now youre right we havent booked a provision for a while i think if we found ourselves in a situation where we thought couple of things if we thought or if we saw actual loan growth quite a bit higher than maybe we had this quarter and if you combine that with maybe a more concerning sort of a rate environment and a more concerning sort of lending environment we could find ourselves with provisions i dont think were i think its the sort of conversation that well be having throughout the quarter i dont think its a slam dunk either way all things being equal if we did record a provision need a provision in the fourth quarter i couldnt see that it would be anything cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 that really material but you are right i think that the conversations continue to be good with the cecl execution committee we are having a lot of good conversations and i wouldnt be completely surprised either way to be honest with you if we recorded zero or if we recorded some small provision of a couple of million i wouldnt be surprised and a lot of it is going to depend on how we see the environment over the next quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed jennifer please check and see if your line is muted jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good afternoon just curious about what youre seeing within your asset quality trends are you seeing any weakness underneath the covers in any areas that are worth noting at this point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc jennifer the short answer is really no we talk about what are we seeing i mean there inflation is a lot of people havent gone through that i kid to john that some of the analysts have been doing this a long time obviously so have i and weve been through inflationary cycles before a lot of people havent that are in business today and were careful to make sure that were asking the right questions and our loan officers are particularly ones who do not live in an increasing rate environment inflationary environment understand what to ask and the things that can be happening to businesses i think the things to watch are commercial real estate deals and probably not so much existential credit issues as opposed to are they going to be able to meet certain covenants if youve got covenants in there where you have to be able to cash flow x times debt service and you assume some kind of phantom debt service number i mean those numbers are getting pretty high and i dont think that theyll really have much like i say existential impact on things but you could see some risk rates move as a result of that i think were seeing you know youre seeing cap rates beginning to rise particularly on deals that dont have the opportunity to increase rents like youre not seeing cap rates move so much on multifamily where you get an opportunity to change those rents in relation to inflation whereas you might see an industrial deal with a single tenant very high credit quality tenant but those are longterm leases youre not going to get the opportunity to increase those cash flows from rental rate increases so youre seeing cap rates move up on those you can ask yourself is that going to affect these deals at all but if you look at us we saw problem loans decline this quarter we saw nonperformers decline this quarter so its still hard to see it anywhere but if you look at the real estate area you look at deals people being more you know theyre pausing certain deals are going back to the drawing board on certain deals and so things are slowing somewhat i think interest rates are a factor there that its trying to slow things down i think theyre being cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 somewhat successful there and i think usually anytime you have a large election i think business owners tend to pause a little bit and see what happens if theres any great change that might occur one way or the other and i think were probably feeling a little bit of that so no cracks right now credit still looks really good and well just have to see what the economy does from here jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks phil phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc youre welcome operator and our final question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc ph good evening ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just had a couple of quick followup questions one in terms of the branch expansion could you remind us after the end of the year how many more branches you have remaining in terms of as you think about opening in phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i would guess in round numbers youve got about to do in dallas and probably 4ish or so four five in houston for our expansion so well be seeing round numbers around ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and anything just given the environment better or worse that would make you want to do accelerate or maybe open more branches than these or what you had initially planned given the success that youve had in any new markets that youre looking at phil in terms of they might deploy the same strategy over the next year or two cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the thing that well do is well continue to look at attractive markets in the state were not done with that and weve talked about for years now about understanding the austin market and how that may or may not be different from some of the larger strategies weve used in dallas and houston and were continuing to do that i think if you heard us talk on the calls last couple of calls weve had some in some new locations in what ill call the more consumeroriented markets theyre more rooftops than they are well ill call premier businesses there and you know that about twothirds of the profitability of this strategy has been always based on the commercial middlemarket piece but some of the returns and some of the performance weve had in these more consumercentric now admittedly higher income consumercentric markets has been pretty remarkable and it results in two things one is your mix of assets leans a little harder on the consumer side if you look at our dallas early numbers again dallas was early in the game but its interesting that half of our loans are consumer loans in the dallas market and half commercial as opposed to lets say take houston which is like commercial consumer and so the reason i mention that is that i think it gives them opportunity in those markets that might be more house top oriented and the other thing about those markets is they tend to be a little bit smaller so they dont have to be as big and if it turns out that what were seeing in these markets has legs that i think it could open up some new opportunities for us in markets that weve already been in which might have indiscernible a little bit more consumercentric and i think it also might help us as we evaluate some of these new markets that we might go into new geographies and state that might be a little bit more consumercentric than commercial it could be that those might actually be viable markets for us as well so i think what weve been seeing recently to me makes me a little bit more optimistic on our ability to continue to expand the strategy and like i say were going to see more and more i think the strategy is i used two words about it i believe that its scalable and i believe its durable and i believe that well be doing this for a long time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful thanks phil and i guess one followup for you jerry if i heard you correctly did you say you are adding mostly mortgagebacked securities right now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc munis and mortgagebacked ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and i guess the question is as we think about there are other banks who are trying to hedge their margins to prevent if rates begin to go lower at some point over the next few years anything that youre doing synthetically in terms of defending the margin against lower rates and how do you think and i guess with the mortgage securities it does increase prepayment risk if and when rates go lower so just want to get your thought process around managing the margin against lower rates jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 yeah so some obviously we continue to have those conversations i think that part of the conversation obviously is all the liquidity that we have some of the analysis we do is of course if we thought rates were going down we could make bigger bets right with all that liquidity in hand which certainly would help protect the margin during a period of decreasing rates so i think that thats one of the things thats out there and i think the other thing that weve talked about and this is outside of the investment portfolio obviously is that given our deposit rates weve got a lot more room than most to bring deposit rates down i mean weve proven that we will and we can in the low rate environment we did it when we started raising rates in and when rates came down in and we were moving our rates down so weve got that opportunity as well i mean its not something that we would want to do but were certainly not afraid to do it and could do it to protect the margin but again also analyzing where those purchases could be we could make ill call them bullettype purchases of significant amounts of liquidity if we decided we wanted to do that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thanks for taking my questions operator we have
