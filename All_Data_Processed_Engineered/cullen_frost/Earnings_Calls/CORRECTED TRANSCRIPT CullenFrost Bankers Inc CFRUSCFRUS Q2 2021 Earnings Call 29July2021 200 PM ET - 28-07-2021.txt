compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year and compared with million or a share in the first quarter in the current environment our company is in a strong position to benefit from the rebound in economic activity and we will continue our organic growth strategy while taking steps to enhance frosts experience for our customers and our employees as expected economic conditions have continued to weigh on conventional loan demand overall average loans in the second quarter were billion a decrease of compared to billion in the second quarter of last year excluding ppp loans second quarter average loans of billion represented a decline of compared to second quarter of however were seeing evidence of loan growth beginning to materialize as a nonppp loans trended up in the month of june and that upward trend has continued into july average deposits in the second quarter were billion an increase of more than compared with billion in the second quarter of last year our return on average assets and average common equity in the second quarter were and respectively we did not report a credit loss expense for the second quarter our asset quality outlook is stable and in general problem assets are declining in number new problems have dropped significantly andor at prepandemic levels net chargeoffs for the second quarter totaled million compared with million in the first quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the second quarter were basis points of average loans nonaccrual loans were million at the end of the second quarter a slight increase from million at the end of the first quarter and primarily represented the addition of three smaller energy loans which had previously been identified as problems a year ago nonaccrual loans stood at million overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the second quarter were million or basis points of periodend loans and were at manageable prepandemic levels weve discussed in the past billion and day deferrals granted to borrowers earlier in the pandemic as of the end of the second quarter there were no active deferrals total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were million at the end of the second quarter compared with million at the end of the first quarter ill point out the energy loans decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the second quarter as we continue to make progress toward a midsingle digit concentration level this portfolio over time our teams continue to analyze the nonenergy portfolio segments that we considered most at risk from pandemic impacts as of the second quarter those segments are restaurants hotels and entertainment and sports of these portfolio segments the total excluding ppp loans represented billion at the end of the second quarter and our loan loss reserve for these segments was the credit quality of these individual credits in these segments is currently mostly stable or better compared to the end of the first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 we also continue to add to our customer base through the midpoint of this year we added more new commercial relationships than we did in which included the outsized second quarter of when ppp activity was so strong looking at recent trends our new commercial relationships were in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of this year and in our most recent quarter so were seeing good momentum in this area were also seeing good momentum in the insurance business particularly in the benefits and property and casualty segment were up about in both of those in terms of new customers and also as many others were seeing good growth in wealth management from assets under management with these good markets but weve also seen an increase of around in new customers in the time since we began our ppp efforts just under new commercial relationships identified our assistance in the ppp process as a significant reason for moving to frost new loan commitments booked during the second quarter excluding ppp loans were up by compared to the second quarter last year and up by on a linkedquarter basis our current weighted pipeline is higher than one year ago higher than last quarter and higher than the same time in the increases are mostly due to ci our current weighted pipeline is as high as its ever been so we hope this points for a good third quarter for booking new loans at the same time it has to be said that competition is intense in total the percentage of deals lost to structure of was down from the we saw this time last year but thats really more a factor of the increase in price competition rather than more market discipline around structure we were extremely proud to have completed our branch houston expansion initiative in the second quarter and we continue to be very pleased with the results it represents a tremendous achievement for our outstanding staff let me update you where we stand through the second quarter and it excludes ppp loans our numbers of new households were of target and represents almost new individuals and businesses our loan volumes were of target and represented million in outstandings and about represented commercial credits with about consumer regarding deposits at million they represent of target and they represent about twothirds commercial and onethird consumer once again i hope that weve shown that the character of the business were generating through the expansion is very consistent with the overall company and its profitability is weighted towards small and midsized businesses and complemented by consumer as well as other lines of business including wealth management and insurance consumer banking also continues to see outstanding growth in just the first six months of this year weve already surpassed our alltime annual growth for new customer relationships this represents about net new checking customers our previous high was for full year and its all organic growth we worked hard to lower barriers to entry for potential customers with improved product offerings and our geographic expansion houston accounts for about onethird of this relationship growth their annual growth rate for consumer customers is up over that compares to in before we started the expansion we were excited to announce this month that we launched a new feature called early payday which gives customers access to direct deposits up to two days before the money arrives in their account and we put this in cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 place in time for customers to see the effect from the irs child tax credit payments and weve already heard great comments from customers whove used early payday to pay bills this makes a difference in the lives of people who live paycheck to paycheck and that was on top of our overdraft grace feature that we rolled out in april also earlier this month we reached an atm branding partnership with cardtronics that will result in us having more than atms in our network across texas that is by far the largest atm network in the state but just as important it gives us the largest atm network in the dallasfort worth region as we began our expansion in dallas early next year i mentioned ppp earlier and how our efforts help thousands of small business and we closed out second round of ppp with more than loans for billion and combined with the first round that gives us a ppp program total of more than loans and billion in outstandings the historic effort that frost bankers put into helping borrowers get ppp loans is now shifted to the forgiveness process because borrowers for the first round are approaching payment dates if they dont apply for forgiveness weve increased our communication to them and worked on ways to make the forgiveness application process simpler weve already submitted forgiveness applications and received approval on nearly of them or billion thats close to the entire first round total we continue to be optimistic about the economy and what lies ahead we have the best team in the financial services industry and thanks to them well continue to grow and extend our unique value proposition to more customers now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease was impacted by a higher proportion of earning assets being invested in loweryielding balances to fed in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter partially offset by the positive impact of the ppp loan portfolio interestbearing deposits at the fed averaged billion or of our earning assets in the second quarter up from billion or of earning assets in the prior quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans our net interest margin percentage would have been in the second quarter down from an adjusted for the first quarter with all of the decrease resulting from the higher level of balances at the fed in the second quarter the taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was up basis points from the previous quarter and was impacted by an acceleration of ppp forgiveness during the quarter which accelerated the recognition of the associated deferred fees excluding the impact of ppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been up basis points from the prior quarter to add some additional color on our ppp loans forgiveness payments received accelerated during the quarter totaling billion compared to the million received in the prior quarter as a result of the accelerated forgiveness interest income including fees on ppp loans totaled about million in the second quarter up significantly from the approximately million recorded in the first quarter given our current projections on the speed of forgiveness of the remainder of our ppp loans we currently expect that the interest income on ppp cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 loans recognized in the third quarter would be less than onehalf of the million recorded in the second quarter total forgiveness payments through the second quarter were approximately billion in total ppp loans at the end of june were billion down from the billion at the end of march at the end of the second quarter we had approximately million in net deferred fees remain to be recognized and we currently expect a little over of that to be recognized this year looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter up about million from the first quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the second quarter down basis points from the first quarter the yield on the taxable portfolio which average billion was down basis points from the first quarter as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mbs securities given faster prepayments our municipal portfolio averages about billion during the second quarter down million from the first quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of flat with the prior quarter at the end of the second quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was years in line with the first quarter investment purchases during the quarter were approximately million and consisted of about million in municipal securities with a te yield of about and about million in 20year treasuries with the remainder in mbs securities regarding noninterest expense looking at the fullyear we currently expect an annual expense growth rate of around from our total reported noninterest expenses and regarding income tax expense the effective tax rate for the quarter was up from the reported in the first quarter as a result of higher earnings but also impacted by lower tax benefits realized from employee stock option activity in the second quarter as compared to the first we currently are projecting a fullyear effective tax rate in the range of to regarding estimates for fullyear earnings given our second quarter results and recognition of lower ppp accretion for the remainder of the year we currently believe the current mean of analyst estimate at is reasonable with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry well now open it up for questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of jennifer demba from truist securities your line is open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi jennifer jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc im just wondering if you could talk about the branch expansion and kind of the deposits and loan balances in the new offices at this point in houston and how many offices you expect to open in dallas and over what timeframe phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay as i mentioned the character of the business that were generating the branches looks pretty close to what we do in the overall company it is about twothirds commercial at this point on deposits about a third consumer thats a little bit higher than our bank totals on commercial consumer mix were probably somewhere between and on the commercial if you look at the total company i think thats pretty close and if you look at your loans commercial and consumer if you look at the commercial number i think the biggest component of that is going to be traditional ci loans second largest would be owneroccupied real estate of that type of thing i can tell you jennifer that weve been seeing the size of loan that were doing in the expansion branches has been increasing but its still deeply core i think the latest numbers i saw only had like three relationships that had loans of million and more so this is really good core business for us and i think the last number i saw is the average loan size about million and if you go back several months that would been probably more like in really round number so were seeing those numbers get a little bit larger but were not elephant hunting and i think thats good for us and i think that it really shows that two things one i think the economy is improving so you get a little bit more demand but i also think that the new bankers are becoming the custom to our systems and our underwriting and our offerings and theyre also being more successful prospecting so thats what were seeing on the loan side there ill tell you that in dallas i really believe its going to be very consistent with what we see in houston market you cant argue that dallas might have even a little bit more cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 diversified economy than houston because of the impact of energy on the houston market dallas i think is known for in general business i think its got over corporate headquarters there from an old number that i remember hearing and i think that our kind of business banking is going to resonate very well there and it has already i think dallas has had a pretty good year so i think well see pretty much the same kind of impact i was really glad for us to be able get the opportunity to create that number one atm network in the dfw market that has been as good as our network has been in the state i think we might have been number three before two or three we were probably four or so maybe five ish in terms of atm network in dfw particularly dallas and this really takes that barrier to entry off the table and i think puts us in a really strong position as we move forward in that market beginning in january jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc so what are you seeing in terms of wage pressure right now and what are you seeing in terms of there seems to be a war for talent out there so im just wondering what you guys are experiencing phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc we are experiencing it i keep going back to this conversation i had with our director of hr this has been at least a month ago now but she came in and we were talking about cellphone customer service operators i think she said weve got about applications a week typically for that position and i think she said that as of last week we got three this shows you how much competition there is not just from other businesses but at that point in time there was the government benefits which were also frankly a competitive factor so were seeing from our customers everyone we talk to talks about wage pressure and talk about the inability to hire people and thats on top of the supply chain issues that are out there so were experiencing it its a little bit worse in some markets but its bad in all of them maybe a little bit worse in dallas and austin but again its bad in all of them so its tough jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc welcome operator your next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven if you are on mute please unmute your line is now open i think we have to move on steven if you can hear us you may press star again to ask a question your next question is from the line of brady gailey of kbw your line is open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so cash as a percentage of average earning assets just keeps going up for you guys i mean its now and i know earlier this year we had talked about frost potentially using some of that cash to deploy into the bond book but as weve seen the longend of the curve has gone down here so maybe just updated thoughts on when you feel is the right time to start putting some of that cash to work in a higher earning asset jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady i think weve been pretty consistent what we said last quarter was that our plan wasnt to make any major purchases until late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter thats still currently our expectations obviously well keep an eye on the market and we do every day its something were talking about all the time but we did some purchases at municipals as i mentioned during the quarter we were somewhat opportunistic though as yields had been coming down and we saw the ability to get in there early so we did accelerate a couple of hundred million of purchases there but at this point were more focused on late into the third and im really thinking early in the fourth as we begin to see the deferred fees associated with ph ppp start coming off the books as we said theyre accelerated in there we saw a big chunk of them this quarter and theyll continue payoff through the rest of this year so thats our current thought process obviously well keep an eye on the market if something comes up if we have an opportunity well jump in did we like the market the yields days ago better than we do today most certainly but i think given what we see and our expectations we still believe that inflation is out there its not just temporary sort of conversation thats going on its still mentioned even on the salary side that we talk about so were being consistent at this point i havent seen anything thats made us change our thought process too much but again well be conscious of when its time to pull the trigger as to what it makes sense to do brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then what do you think about the magnitude of these purchases as you mentioned your bond book is around billion how much growth could we see beginning this year and into next year is it going to be significant or is it just going to be modest jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 well you mentioned kind of looking at cash as a percent of earning assets and even cash as a percentage of total assets and obviously were way above any level that weve been here within the recent past so you know us and you followed us for a long time were pretty conservative and have been on the amount of balances that we typically have at the fed but given the fact that i think this morning we had billion in balances there were looking to make significant purchases its not going to be all at once obviously but the thought process today is that we would utilize a significant amount of that liquidity in and into as well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then my last question just on the deposit side your deposit growth has been amazing you had last year first half of this year youre still at over at annualized pace do you think that eventually some of these deposits will move back out of the bank how do you think about sustaining all of this notable deposit growth weve seen over the last year or so jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah it was a i have to admit i was amazed looking even at the linkedquarter growth if you look at it annualized it was even stronger than the yearago growth i think phil talked a lot about our focus on new relationships and we continue to do well when we look at our 12month rolling average of whats going on with our deposit base we still see obviously that augmentation of our existing customers is i think something north of say but were still getting growth from new customers about which is still a good chunk but what weve also seen is were seeing a lot of our larger commercial accounts increasing their deposit balances as well and its been at some of the higher level i think that given the rate environment that were in right now given what youre seeing out there as far as investment is concerned i think its really hard to gauge when we might see those deposits leave at this point we continue to feel like the deposit level that we saw through the end of the second quarter it was pretty consistent in july that sort of level growth so we havent really seen any sort of runoff in our projections right now dont really have us growing a lot more from here and a lot of it is really more due to the uncertainty as you said so i think weve been really impressed with where were at and the growth that weve seen both from existing customers and from our new relationships but youre right theres still a lot of uncertainty out there a lot of liquidity out there and hopefully as some of the economy starts to take off youd expect that some of those dollars both on the consumer side and on the commercial side will probably be spent and probably would be a good sign for the economy and for whats going on but at this point were not projecting it to go much from here but i havent seen any indication as of today that would indicate theyre moving brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys operator your next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 thank you can you guys hear me phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i dont what happened before first i just want to drill down a little further into the commentary around deposits if you guys look at the nonppp loans you said trended nice up in june and up so far in july for those customers that are starting to draw their lines on the commercial side are they working their deposits down at all first or are they just concurrently bringing deposits to you and then also drawing on their lines further phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah steve thats a good question it just depends i see so many anecdotal stories i talked to customers whove just had gamechanging experiences with ppp or with grants i mean complete reduction of debt on balance sheets weve all got stories that we see there so there and i think one thing that were seeing is weve got probably weve got ci opportunities but weve got a fair amount of cre opportunities the cre is probably a different deal than the scenario you described i think what youre talking about is mainly ci regular ci lending so and its just hard to pinpoint a dramatic trend either way i just think it depends on the business a lot of businesses just didnt get any ppp funds so theyre really been dependent upon what theyre seeing in the economy or in the ci activity now theyre willing to expand so i think thats probably driving most of that same time as i said thereve been some really game changing balance sheet changes that have happened for some companies with regard to their liquidity and debt loads and also i wish i had a good answer for you i just dont know steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah a bit perplexing but okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah steven the one thing i will say is early on and youre probably aware of this a lot of us were saying that when ppp first started last year the deposits the loans would be made and the deposits would stay right the money wasnt spent immediately and so a lot of the conversation was around the inflation and the deposits if you will were just the fact that that customers got a ppp loan and then just park the money and were not really seeing that being the case weve seen movement of most of those and again you cant tag that specific ppp loan to a deposit and then just stay be able to follow it completely but when we look at the activity within those cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 accounts really it looks like those dollars were spent so it doesnt look like we are in that same situation that we were at say to months ago steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay and then i wanted to drill down on the new net checking accounts you opened in the quarter whats the base in other words whats the growth rate phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so if you look at our customer growth overall thats about a annualized growth and im thinking its round numbers but we could divide that but i mean thats i mean to that to me is amazing honestly i mean weve had we have had goals to grow that number i think our goal was to maybe get the one day because youre talking about a large base there and for us to be at over now on the entire base i mean im just im really excited about that and thats not an accident that cant be an accident steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so what portion of those are coming through digital channels versus the traditional branch and does it very much in use than just given your opening new branches there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah im thinking that 35ish percent comes through digital but i saw that number two hours ago and i just dont have it here handy but a significant amount hang on maybe i got it i would say about 30ishpercent in round numbers it looks like not a bad number steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay yeah very impressive okay thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you bet operator your next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just just wanted to clarify jerry around your ppp numbers you mentioned about million i think in the second quarter million in that implies an nii of about million quarterly for the first half just wondering it sounds like youre managing the securities book with an eye on the nii outlook is that indiscernible exppp around million the right way to think about where you might be in the back half of the year and where you would look to grow from as you look to redeploy cash into securities jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i do think that it looks like the nim percentage mightve hit the floor there but again a lot of its going to be dependent on if and when we pull the trigger on the investment portfolio purchases as you said so thats obviously a big driver of it so and again thats the level of deposits we really dont know whats happened the level of growth that weve had is really been a lot more obviously than we expected and keeping that liquidity at the fed has really had a downward pressure on that nim percentage so its going to be dependent on those things youre right but i think at this point i think youre thinking about it right we kind of feel like were at the bottom of that it was nice to see the loan yields up a little bit even on a linked quarter basis even exppp but im going to tell you that theres a lot of pricing pressure a lot of competition there and obviously weve said and we continue to say were relationship bank and we dont want to lose relationships for a few basis points so were really saying that we want to be competitive there so we could feel a little bit of pressure there well continue to feel pressure there i shouldnt say that we wont because we will and its going to continue from everything that i hear so well feel some pressure on that loan yield but i think knock on wood given all things being equal i think we may have hit bottom there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible cash deployment into securities is that more a function of the interest rate goal or is it a function of how quickly ppp runs off like whats the bigger driver of your thought process indiscernible the cash jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no its not really related to the ppp runoff i mean obviously were aware of it so its not like we can look in our financials and not realize it but no thats not really not going to be the thing that pulls the trigger i mean wed already been talking about before the acceleration of the forgiveness that we were talking i think phil mentioned in the call last quarter that we were talking about late third most likely early fourth so again we dont like the market we have the right to not pull the trigger if we dont think its where we want to be but where were headed i mean thats the thought process at this point ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just a separate question phil you have talked about this in the past you introduced the early payday the grace period on deposits just talk to us in terms of the retail side of the bank you shared some indiscernible what are you seeing in terms of customer behavior indiscernible about acquiring ph plans and of the checking accounts that you talked about what cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 percentage are truly translating into customer where you see them as being indiscernible to ones where you might indiscernible on the road just talk to us in terms of how many of these account indiscernible relationship for frost phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay ebrahim youre breaking up i apologize a bit but let me answer what i think i heard your question of the i think you ask about accounts how many relationships with frost just one point of clarification those are not accounts those are new relationships so and we dont count it a relationship unless we get a checking account okay so these are not we could go on and advertise higher rates on cds or higher rates on money market deposit accounts and bring in a bunch of rate shoppers or whatever these are relationships the account number is consistent so i really believe that all these represent solid relationships from us and another thing we keep an eye on you have to keep an eye on is what is attrition look like and our attrition year overyear has been really good i think our closed accounts were up only yearoveryear quarter in the second quarter so were doing a good job there i mean and when you look at the value proposition i mean weve got a really great comparison with our new overdraft raise and with our you know the early payday and another thing to keep in mind is about of our customers were the primary relationship where we have their direct deposit so i think that also speaks well of what our how sticky and how deep these relationships are but i apologize again there was some breakup when you were asking the question if ive missed something please guide me to where i should be going ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no i think that addressed it and sorry about that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no worries operator thank you very much your next question is from ken zerbe of morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you just want to clarify really quick in terms of the expense growth is the base that youre looking at the full million from last year i know theres some onetime items in results late last year so just wondering jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah im just going off the reported number that million youre right ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 got it okay perfect and then in terms of provision expense obviously a couple of quarters in a row zero is it fair to assume that youre going to try to stay at zero on a goforward basis or i know other banks have obviously been releasing a lot more reserves based on their cecl model but theres also some subjectivity to cecl modeling thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right yeah i think youre right at this point we havent recorded any provision for the year and a big part of us of our allowance calculation need if you will is associated with the overlays right because the models itself and well release our 10q this afternoon and we gave quite a bit of detail on how that cecl worked the models did actually recalculate if you will lower reserve requirement but what weve said is given all the uncertainty that we continue to see associated with the pandemic and the effects it has on certain parts of the economy and again given all the uncertainty that weve seen here recently with the variant we feel that it really was not the time to release any reserves we obviously feel real comfortable about our reserve coverage but thought there was too much uncertainty in the market for us to release reserves at the end of the day we got to look at it every quarter and see where were at i know there are some thoughts that the septemberoctober timeframe will be interesting given that youve got a lot of employers requiring or requesting employees to get back to work after labor day youll have the kids back in school obviously the variant conversation thats going on currently is starting to highlight other issues with the mask again so we think that come septemberoctober i think itll be interesting to see where were at i dont expect and maybe this is a given i dont expect this to have provisions for the rest of the year given where were at but as far as any discussion about would we be releasing reserves that really be dependent on what were seeing at the end of the third quarter at the end of the fourth quarter right now i think there was just too much uncertainty given what we were seeing to release reserves ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it that makes sense and i certainly understand the variability around the delta variant but just i guess if the economy does get better lets say the moodys models get better in but there is still that concern i mean do you have enough flexibility that you can continue to add to the qualitative reserves like for the next couple quarters im just wondering if theres a limit to where youre unable to just to keep adding qualitative if that make sense jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i know it does and obviously the thought process there is i think my take on it would be the more the bigger percentage of your allowance that is related to overlays of qualitative factors the more quantitative those qualitative factors will have to be if that makes sense im not going to be at a point where i can say the and it would never be the case but like have an extreme where the models would say i needed million lets say and i had a million overlay to get you a million reserve thats never going to be the case and so again i think given where were at i think our overlay youll see whats significant compared to the models this quarter we feel comfortable with that but i think to answer that question is could we not or could we grow our qualitative reserve as a percentage of the total allowance for the rest of the quarters i think thats a difficult cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 question to answer if we did lets say we got to that point i think what youd find is that the support for that would be a lot more quantitative in nature even if its a qualitative adjustment if that makes sense ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc it does all right thank you very much jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator your next question is from the line of dave rochester from compass point your line is open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey back on your expense guide it seems like that would imply a pretty decent step up in the expense run rate in the back half of the year maybe to that level quarterly just to hit that roughly any color as to what lines youre expecting will drive that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure well ill just talk about a couple of things there weve really i think i have said this last time and we were having a meeting with the head of our marketing group weve really been light for the first half of the year on marketing expenses so we are projecting a pretty big increase in marketingrelated expenses especially in the fourth quarter so thats going to take a big bite out of that increase in addition to that were going to have additional expenses with that houston expansion in the second half because as weve got more and more settle there youll see that rise and as weve talked about were going to do future expansion there and also the dallas expansion well see a little bit of that you wont see a lot but its going to run through our numbers here we also have incentives that get paid in the fourth quarter that are onetime ph hedge or discrete to that quarter so thats also going to affect the line items there phil mentioned some salary pressures we continue to have that and then also really weve got open positions that were trying to fill there are a lot of requests for a lot of desire for some talent thats not that easy to find and so were projecting that we can fill those positions but its taking us longer to do that than we had expected cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 and so and then generally i think just in the other expense category its been a little bit slower starting out the year i think now that we started cranking up and people are in the office and were starting to visit with customers again youll see just an increase if you will in this general sort of meals and entertainment sort of category of items than weve had in the first half of the year i will say that we continue to focus on expenses i mean to tell you if we are able to beat that growth im going to be happy about it but at this point given what im seeing thats what it looks like right now and theres some specific things like i mentioned that i can put my finger on that are going to drive that increase david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great appreciate all the color there maybe just switching to the margin you mentioned loan pricing pressure a bit on the call was just curious what the front book back book differential is now on new loan yields versus the roll off rate at this point jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc what i saw was basis points on the weighted for commercial portfolio decreased on the new business in the quarter versus the back book david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then you guys mentioned still feeling comfortable about making the securities purchases a few months from now i was just wondering if the curves at that point looks like it does today are you still okay with that and would you still plan to accelerate those purchases phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its hard to say i think everybody hates this market and a few people understand what the tenure is doing when inflation is growing like gangbusters and it continues to go down so i mean well do all we have to do i mean we sit for a long time really all year long that we look at the late third fourth quarter to be when we thought wed be pulling the trigger on this stuff obviously we thought rates would be higher that point in time and inflation would have reared its head and the market would have responded well half of that happened inflation is reared more than its head and the market has really responded on it we also said during that time that we might miss the peak and we have at least at this point but then were still going from or basis points to basis points or basis points so theres still a lot of operating leverage that well bring to the party when we decide to do it but i would love to see clearly theres been volatility in the market as relates to yields weve got some time based on our timeframe to see that play out in the marketplace id love to see some variability happen and be able to take advantage of some of it on the high side well see i know thats not definitive but no ones got the answer to that question right now david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right great and maybe one last on capital those ratios continue to grow just in general cet1 ratio is inching up to how do you think about that do you expect those to continue to grow from here are you thinking about buying back some shares to stabilize that any thoughts there would be great cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc weve said repeatedly and you saw us increase our dividend this quarter our focus is really on ensuring we can pay that dividend thats what our primary focus is on im sure you saw on our balance sheet that and we talked about earlier in the call i mean assets are going like crazy given all the deposit growth that were seeing and if you look at our leverage ratio were probably a little low compared to peers and weve been coming down there so we keep an eye on that so really dave right now id say that were more focused on ensuring that we pay the dividend more than we are on the stock buyback david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay great thanks guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure thank you operator thank you operator instructions speakers im no longer seeing any questions i would like to turn the call back to phil for closing remarks phillip d green chairman
