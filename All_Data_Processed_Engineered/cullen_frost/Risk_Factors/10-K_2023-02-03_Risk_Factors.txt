item risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the market price of our common stock and preferred stock could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business interest rate risks we are subject to interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions inflationary trends changes in government spending and debt issuances and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and iii the average duration of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings any substantial unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section captioned net interest income and item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to interest rate sensitivity and our management of interest rate risk we may be adversely impacted by the transition from libor as a reference rate the united kingdoms financial conduct authority and the administrator of libor have announced that the publication of the most commonly used us dollar london interbank offered rate libor settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after june the publication of all other libor settings ceased to be published as of december given consumer protection litigation and reputation risks the bank regulatory agencies indicated that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks and that they would examine bank practices accordingly the adjustable interest rate libor act enacted in march provides a statutory framework to replace us dollar libor with a benchmark rate based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr for contracts governed by us law that have no or ineffective fallbacks and in december the federal reserve board adopted related implementing rules although governmental authorities have endeavored to facilitate an orderly discontinuation of libor no assurance can be provided that this aim will be achieved or that the use level and volatility of libor or other interest rates or the value of liborbased securities will not be adversely affected as a result and despite the enactment of the libor act for the most commonly used libor settings the use or selection of a successor rate could expose us to risks associated with disputes and litigation with our customers and counterparties and other market participants in connection with implementing libor fallback provisions we discontinued originating liborbased loans effective december and are now negotiating loans using our preferred replacement index ameribor a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange as well as sofr and bsby a benchmark developed by bloomberg index services as of december approximately billion of our outstanding loans and in addition certain derivative contracts borrowings and other financial instruments have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor the transition from libor has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk we are subject to litigation and reputational risks if we are unable to renegotiate and amend existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on libor including contracts that do not have fallback language the timing and manner in which each customers contract transitions to ameribor sofr or bsby will vary on a casebycase basis there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the libor transition since ameribor sofr and bsby rates are calculated differently payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing libor which may lead to increased volatility as compared to libor the transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models valuation tools product design and hedging strategies furthermore failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from libor will be failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations credit and lending risks we are subject to lending risk and lending concentration risk there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the state of texas and the united states increases in interest rates andor weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial energy construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default and are typically larger than residential real estate loans or consumer loans because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial energy construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans increases in nonperforming loans have resulted in a net loss of earnings from particular loans an increase in credit loss expense and an increase in loan chargeoffs and these and future instances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations certain of our credit exposures are concentrated in industries that may be more susceptible to the longterm risks of climate change natural disasters or global pandemics to the extent that these risks may have a negative impact on the financial condition of borrowers it could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the section captioned loans in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial energy construction and commercial real estate loans our allowance for credit losses may be insufficient we maintain allowances for credit losses on loans securities and offbalance sheet credit exposures in the case of loans and securities allowances for credit losses are contraasset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as a result the determination of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates related to current and expected future credit risks and trends all of which may undergo material changes continuing deterioration in economic conditions including the possibility of a recession affecting borrowers and securities issuers inflation rising interest rates new information regarding existing loans credit commitments and securities holdings the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic or other global pandemics natural disasters and risks related to climate change and identification of additional problem loans ratings downgrades and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowances for credit losses on loans securities and offbalance sheet credit exposures in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in credit loss expense or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments different than those of management furthermore if any chargeoffs related to loans securities or offbalance sheet credit exposures in future periods exceed our allowances for credit losses on loans securities or offbalance sheet credit exposures we will need to recognize additional credit loss expense to increase the applicable allowance any increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans securities andor offbalance sheet credit exposures will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the section captioned allowance for credit losses in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses we are subject to risk arising from conditions in the commercial real estate market as of december commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised approximately of our loan portfolio commercial real estate mortgage loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential real estate mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrowers control such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations in recent years commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the longterm performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio accordingly the federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market failures in our risk management policies procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in and increased losses from this portfolio which accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to volatility risk in crude oil prices as of december we had million of energy loans which comprised approximately of our loan portfolio at that date furthermore energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of our primary markets actions by members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec can impact global crude oil production levels and lead to significant volatility in global oil supplies and market oil prices in recent years decreased market oil prices compressed margins for many us and texasbased oil producers particularly those that utilize highercost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling as well as oilfield service providers energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers among others in march of disagreements between members of opec signaled that production levels would rise and when coupled with the uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic led to a significant decline in market oil prices as the global economy emerged from pandemic lockdowns in the demand for oil naturally increased and supply could not keep up with the sudden surge in demand consequently oil prices began to rise the current russian invasion of ukraine has also impacted global oil supplies and caused further increases in oil prices the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately at december up from at december we have experienced increased losses within our energy portfolio in recent years which were impacted by oil price volatility relative to our historical experience continued oil price volatility could have further negative impacts on the us economy in particular the economies of energydominant states such as texas and our borrowers and customers we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or ability to sell the affected property environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk we are subject to liquidity risk we require liquidity to meet our deposit and debt obligations as they come due our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the texas economy difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors in particular a substantial majority of our liabilities are demand savings interest checking and money market deposits which are payable on demand or upon several days notice while by comparison a substantial portion of our assets are loans which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame we may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future especially if a large number of our depositors sought to withdraw their accounts regardless of the reason our access to deposits may be negatively impacted by among other factors periods of low interest rates or higher interest rates which could promote increased competition for deposits including from new financial technology competitors or provide customers with alternative investment options a failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operational risks our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models the processes we use to estimate our expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances even if these assumptions are adequate the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation including flaws caused by failures in controls data management human error or from the reliance on technology if the models we use for interest rate risk and assetliability management are inadequate we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures if the models we use for estimating our expected credit losses are inadequate the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future chargeoffs if the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future as of december we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of cullenfrosts common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to risk arising from failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures our internal controls including fraud detection and controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the controls and procedures are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures or failure to comply with our corporate governance procedures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations including subjecting us to litigation regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions furthermore notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technologybased risk and control systems our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource and we are subject to the risk that they make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures that in the past have not and in the future may not always be prevented by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations human errors malfeasance and other misconduct even if promptly discovered and remediated can result in reputational damage or legal risk and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations new lines of business products or services and technological advancements may subject us to additional risks from time to time we implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business for instance we are currently implementing a new residential mortgage product offering there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers in addition our implementation of certain new technologies such as those related to artificial intelligence automation and algorithms in our business processes may have unintended consequences due to their limitations or our failure to use them effectively in addition cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore any new line of business new product or service andor new technology could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business new products or services andor new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our reputation and our business are subject to negative publicity risk reputation risk or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in our business negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including i lending practices ii branching strategy iii product and service offerings iv corporate governance v regulatory compliance vi mergers and acquisitions vii disclosure viii sharing or inadequate protection of customer information ix successful or attempted cyber attacks against us our customers or our thirdparty partners or vendors and x failure to discharge any publicly announced commitments to employees or environmental social and governance initiatives or to respond adequately to social and sustainability concerns from the viewpoint of our stakeholders from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to our conduct negative public opinion could also result from adverse news or publicity that impairs the reputation of the financial services industry generally or from the actions of our employees customers affiliates or third parties with whom we do business in addition our reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding us whether or not true that may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk is magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels because we conduct most of our business under the frost brand negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risk from changes in customer behavior individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of our control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values inflation taxes or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter anticipated customer behavior including borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect our ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us our customers and others in the financial institutions industry cullenfrost relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue cullenfrost is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on cullenfrosts common stock and preferred stock and interest and principal on cullenfrosts debt various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that frost bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to cullenfrost also cullenfrosts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors and depositors in the event frost bank is unable to pay dividends to cullenfrost cullenfrost may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock the inability to receive dividends from frost bank could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business and note capital and regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report our information systems may experience failure interruption or breach in security in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to our operations information security breaches and cybersecurityrelated incidents include but are not limited to attempts to access information including customer and company information malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access theft misuse loss release or destruction of data including confidential customer information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events these types of threats may derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties or may result from accidental technological failure our technologies systems networks and software have been and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attacks which range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us any failures related to upgrades and maintenance of our technology and information systems could further increase our information and system security risk our increased use of cloud and other technologies such as remote work technologies also increases our risk of being subject to a cyber attack the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our customers employees and third parties that we do business with have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to our information systems the information systems of our merchants or thirdparty service providers andor our customers personal devices which are beyond our security control systems though we endeavor to mitigate these threats through product improvements use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education such cyber attacks against us our merchants our thirdparty service providers and our customers remain a serious issue and have been successful in the past although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable to attempted security breaches or disruptions because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk furthermore in the event of a cyber attack we may be delayed in identifying or responding to the attack which could increase the negative impact of the cyber attack on our business financial condition and results of operations while we maintain specific cyber insurance coverage which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case furthermore because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage a security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers merchants or our thirdparty vendors including as a result of cyber attacks could i disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations andor those of our customers ii result in the unauthorized access to and destruction loss theft misappropriation or release of confidential sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers iii result in a violation of applicable privacy data breach and other laws subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing us to civil litigation enforcement actions governmental fines and possible financial liability iv require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result or v harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our operations rely on certain external vendors we rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our daytoday operations these thirdparty vendors are sources of operational and informational security risk to us including risks associated with operational errors information system failures interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information if these vendors encounter any of these issues or if we have difficulty communicating with them we could be exposed to disruption of operations loss of service or connectivity to customers reputational damage and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations in addition our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements although we have selected these external vendors carefully we do not control their actions the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendors organizational structure financial condition support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason could be disruptive to our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations replacing these external vendors could also entail significant delay and expense we are subject to litigation risk pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to litigation risk pertaining to intellectual property banking and other financial services companies including us rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support daytoday operations technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained competitors of our vendors or other individuals or companies have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors or in use by us and we are and may in the future be named as defendants in various related legal claims such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages and may also seek to enter into licensing agreements with us to obtain ongoing fees regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants we may have to engage in protracted litigation such litigation is often expensive timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management if we are found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty in certain cases we have and in the future may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase our operating expenses if legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against us or settled we could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations external and marketrelated risks our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas our success depends substantially on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which we operate unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers across texas through financial centers in the austin corpus christi dallas fort worth houston permian basin rio grande valley and san antonio regions the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources moreover all of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the state of texas a significant decline in general economic conditions in texas whether caused by recession inflation unemployment changes or prolonged stagnation in oil prices changes in securities markets acts of terrorism pandemics natural disasters climate change outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to risk arising from the soundness of other financial institutions and counterparties financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us increased interconnectivity amongst financial institutions also increases the risk of cyber attacks and information system failures for financial institutions any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us such competitors primarily include national regional and community banks within the various markets where we operate recent regulation has reduced the regulatory burden of large bank holding companies and raised the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bank holding companies with less than billion in total consolidated assets which were previously subject to more stringent enhanced prudential standards to become more competitive or to pursue expansion more aggressively we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings and loans credit unions finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies and other financial intermediaries the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks in particular the activity of fintechswealthtechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow some fintechswealthtechs are not subject to the same regulation as we are which may allow them to be more competitive fintechswealthtechs have and may continue to offer bank or banklike products and a number of such organizations have applied for bank or industrial loan charters while others have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers increased competition from fintechswealthechs and the growth of digital banking may also lead to pricing pressures as competitors offer more lowfee and nofee products additionally consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain as well as advances in robotic process automation could significantly affect the competition for financial services the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits further many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than us additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things i the ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets ii the ability to expand within our marketplace and with our market position iii the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands iv the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors v customer satisfaction with our level of service and vi industry and general economic trends failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations compliance and regulatory risks we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and related enforcement powers and other legal remedies we primarily through cullenfrost frost bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations policies or supervisory guidance could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer limit our ability to return capital to shareholders or conduct certain activities andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to comply with laws regulations policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities including criminal and civil penalties the loss of fdic insurance the revocation of a banking charter enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies significant fines and civil money penalties andor reputational damage in this regard government authorities including the bank regulatory agencies are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus in some instances we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the sections captioned supervision and regulation included in item business and note capital and regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report the repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the doddfrank act beginning on july as a result some financial institutions offer interest on demand deposits to compete for customers our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to government regulation and oversight relating to data and privacy protection our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations the integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us our collection of such customer and company data is subject to extensive regulation and oversight we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase risks related to acquisition activity potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value we generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management economies of scale or expanded services acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things i potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company ii exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company iii potential disruption to our business iv potential diversion of our managements time and attention v the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company vi difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and vii potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction acquisitions may also result in potential dilution to existing shareholders of our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the acquisition furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues acquisitions by financial institutions including us are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies collectively regulatory approvals the process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult since the global financial crisis and our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on the bank regulators views at the time as to our capital levels quality of management and overall condition in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors including our compliance with law regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have or may have with regulatory agencies including without limitation issues related to bank secrecy act compliance community reinvestment act issues fair lending laws fair housing laws consumer protection laws unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and other laws and regulations we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks associated with our common stock and preferred stock the trading volumes in our common stock and preferred stock are less than that of other larger financial services companies although our common stock and preferred stock are listed for trading on the nyse the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock and preferred stock at any given time this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control given the lower trading volumes of our common stock and preferred stock significant sales of our common stock or our preferred stock or the expectation of these sales could cause our stock prices to fall cullenfrost may not continue to pay dividends on its common stock in the future holders of cullenfrost common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although cullenfrost has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of cullenfrosts common stock also cullenfrost is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve board regarding capital adequacy and dividends as more fully discussed in note capital and regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock may also be subject to certain restrictions in the event that we elect to defer the payment of interest on our junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures or do not declare and pay dividends on our series b preferred stock an investment in our common stock or preferred stock is not an insured deposit our common stock and preferred stock are not bank deposits and therefore are not insured against loss by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common stock or preferred stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock or preferred stock in any company as a result if you acquire our common stock or preferred stock you could lose some or all of your investment certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect provisions of federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions effectively inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock general risk factors we are subject to risk from fluctuating conditions in the financial markets and economic and political conditions generally our success depends to a certain extent upon local national and global economic and political conditions as well as governmental monetary policies our financial performance generally and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate in the state of texas and in the united states as a whole a favorable business environment is generally characterized by among other factors economic growth efficient capital markets low inflation low unemployment high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by a decline in economic growth both in the us and internationally declines in business activity or investor or business confidence limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates high unemployment oil price volatility natural disasters trade policies and tariffs or a combination of these or other factors in addition financial markets and global supply chains may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the current russian invasion of ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events current economic conditions are being heavily impacted by elevated levels of inflation and rising interest rates a prolonged period of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses economic and inflationary pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding economic improvement could result in changes in consumer and business spending borrowing and savings habits such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore evolving responses from federal and state governments and other regulators and our customers or our thirdparty partners or vendors to new challenges such as climate change have impacted and could continue to impact the economic and political conditions under which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in the federal state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance and we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities we are subject to federal and applicable state tax laws and regulations changes in these tax laws and regulations some of which may be retroactive to previous periods could increase our effective tax rates and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance furthermore tax laws and regulations are often complex and require interpretation in the normal course of business we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions these tax positions may relate to tax compliance sales and use franchise gross receipts payroll property and income tax issues including tax base apportionment and tax credit planning the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside of our control and our financial condition economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital including interbank borrowings repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve we cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers depositors of frost bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or a downgrade of cullenfrosts or frost banks debt ratings may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity moreover if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our stock price can be volatile stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things i actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations ii recommendations by securities analysts iii operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us iv news reports relating to trends concerns and other issues in the financial services industry v perceptions in the marketplace regarding us andor our competitors vi new technology used or services offered by competitors vii the issuance by us of additional securities including common stock and securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock viii sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after an equity offering or the perception that such sales could occur ix significant acquisitions or business combinations strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors x failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions xi changes in government regulations and xii geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the texas economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions and interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings see note accounting standards updates in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for further information regarding pending accounting standards updates we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in many activities engaged in by us is intense including with respect to compensation and emerging workplace practices accommodations and remote work options and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them we do not currently have employment agreements or noncompetition agreements with any of our senior officers the unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations because of their customer relationships skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel in addition the scope and content of us banking regulators policies on incentive compensation as well as changes to these policies could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate our key employees severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact our business and our customers severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business in addition such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses furthermore the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations climate change could have a material negative impact on us and our customers our business as well as the operations and activities of our customers could be negatively impacted by climate change climate change presents both immediate and longterm risks to us and our customers and these risks are expected to increase over time climate changes presents multifaceted risks including i operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on our facilities and other assets as well as those of our customers ii credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk and iii reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change our carbon footprint and our business relationships with customers who operate in carbonintensive industries our business reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient climate change exposes us to physical risk as its effects may lead to more frequent and more extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts or flooding tornados hurricanes wildfires and extreme seasonal weather and longerterm shifts such as increasing average temperatures ozone depletion and rising sea levels such events and longterm shifts may damage destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of our properties and other assets reduce the availability of insurance andor disrupt our operations and other activities through prolonged outages such events and longterm shifts may also have a significant impact on our customers which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or collateral values and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact which could have a broader impact on the economy supply chains and distribution networks climate change also exposes us to transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbondependent economy transition risks may result from changes in policies laws and regulations technologies andor market preferences to address climate change such changes could materially negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition andor our reputation in addition to having a similar impact on our customers we have customers who operate in carbonintensive industries like oil and gas that are exposed to climate risks such as those risks related to the transition to a less carbondependent economy as well as customers who operate in lowcarbon industries that may be subject to risks associated with new technologies federal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbonintensive environment we face regulatory risk of increasing focus on our resilience to climaterelated risks including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory compliance credit and reputational risks and costs
