the occurrence of unanticipated events application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with asc that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of december and and results of operations for each of the years then ended refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february the form 10k for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report from time to time we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary none of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and as such the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a income tax rate dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands except for per share

the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense and a million increase in income tax expense details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate as of december approximately of our loans had a fixed interest rate while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to the prime interest rate approximately or the london interbank offered rate libor approximately we discontinued originating liborbased loans effective december and have begun to negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index the american interbank offered rate ameribor a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange the secured overnight financing rate sofr or a benchmark developed by bloomberg index services bsby as of december approximately of our loans were tied to one of these three indexes for our currently outstanding liborbased loans the timing and manner in which each customers contract transitions from libor to another rate will vary on a casebycase basis our goal is to complete all transitions by the end of first quarter of select average market rates for the periods indicated are presented in the table below table start federal funds target rate upper bound effective federal

subsequently decrease to by the end of while there can be no such assurance that any increases or decreases in the federal funds rate will occur these projections imply up to a basis point increase in the federal funds rate during followed by a basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate was increased basis points to to effective february we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated including average outstanding balances for each major category of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the interest earned or paid on such amounts and the average rate earned or paid

loans of total loans at december and while energy loans made up and and excluding ppp loans of total loans at both december and and real estate loans made up and and excluding ppp loans of total loans at december and energy loans include commercial and industrial loans leases and real estate loans to borrowers in the energy industry real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances loan originationrisk management we have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions we have begun to explore the credit and reputational risks associated with climate change and their potential impact on the foregoing and are also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk this includes among other things researching and developing a formalized approach to considering climate change related risks in our underwriting processes this approach will be impacted in part by the accessibility and reliability of both customer climate risk data and climate risk data in general one of the objectives of these efforts is to enable us to better understand the climate change related risks associated with our customers business activities and to be able to monitor their response to those risks and their ultimate impact on our customers commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower the cash flows of borrowers however may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee however some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production energy services and other energy loans which includes private clients transportation and equipment providers manufacturers refiners and traders the origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans because however of the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy production loans are secured by proven developed and producing reserves loan proceeds for these types of loans are typically used for the development and drilling of additional wells the acquisition of additional production andor the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled our customers in this sector are generally large independent private ownerproducers or large corporate producers these borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions and as such loans in this portfolio are generally greater than million production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower collateral values are determined by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower collateral value is calculated at least semiannually using thirdparty engineerprepared reserve studies these reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas to qualify as collateral typically reserves must be proven developed and producing for certain borrowers collateral may include up to proven nonproducing reserves loan commitments are limited to of estimated reserve value cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within of the halflife of the underlying reserves loan commitments generally must also be covered by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at of our base case price assumptions in addition the ratio of the borrowers debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda should generally not exceed we generally require production borrowers to maintain an active hedging program to manage risk and to have at least of their production hedged for two years oil and gas service transportation and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas we mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment borrowers in this sector are typically privatelyowned middlemarket companies with annual sales of less than million the services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified and include downhole testing and maintenance providing and threading drilling pipe hydraulic fracturing services or equipment seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector we also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil gas other petrochemicals and ethanol these companies are not dependent on drilling or development as a general policy we do not lend to energy traders however we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders backtoback trading as such the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated ppp loans which were originated in and early are loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act loans covered by the ppp may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments the remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the sba terms of the ppp loans include the following i maximum amount limited to the lesser of million or an amount calculated using a payrollbased formula ii maximum loan term of five years iii interest rate of iv no collateral or personal guarantees are required v no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and vi loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest subject to certain requirements including that no more than of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to nonpayroll costs in return for processing and booking a ppp loan the sba paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan for loans of not more than thousand for loans of more than thousand and less than million and for loans of at least million commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those of real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria as a general rule we avoid financing singlepurpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve in addition management tracks the level of owneroccupied commercial real estate loans versus nonowner occupied loans at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owneroccupied properties with respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by nonowner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies independent appraisal reviews sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project these estimates may be inaccurate construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be precommitted permanent loans from approved longterm lenders sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we originate consumer loans utilizing a credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers minimizes risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements which include but are not limited to loantovalue limitations collection remedies the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements we maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans increased million or during compared to our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including i the development and production of oil or natural gas ii providing oil and gas field servicing iii providing energyrelated transportation services iv providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling v refining petrochemicals or vi trading oil gas and related commodities energy loans decreased million or during compared

include loans to businesses and other entities that would otherwise be reported as commercial and industrial loans and to a lesser extent energy loans originated under the guidelines discussed above we funded approximately billion and billion of sbaapproved ppp loans during and respectively during and we recognized approximately million and million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs respectively as yield adjustments and these amounts are included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in

treasury management lines exposure prior to any portion being sold large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of

loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of december we utilized the moodys analytics december baseline scenario the december baseline scenario to forecast the macroeconomic

credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys baseline scenario for december for our estimated expected credit losses as of december and the moodys consensus scenario for december for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor and other qualitative adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of december modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately resulting in a million total adjustment up from approximately at

and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values we have also provided additional qualitative adjustments or management overlays as of december as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio qfactor and other qualitative adjustments as of december are detailed in the table below table start qfactor adjustment model overlays office building overlays downside scenario overlay credit concentration overlays consumer overlay total commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied construction consumer real estate consumer and other total table end model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effect of risks not captured within our commercial real estate credit loss models these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate owner occupied commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longerterm concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the longterm performance and collateral valuations of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of or worse the downside scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation rising interest rates labor shortages disruption in financial markets and global supply chains further oil price volatility and the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the current war between russia and ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior including borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices to determine this qualitative adjustment we use an alternative more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models as of december we used the moodys analytics november s3 alternative scenario downside 90th percentile the november s3 scenario in modeling expected credit losses using this scenario we also assume each loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level the qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense adjusted based upon managements assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature timing and amount management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large concentrated credit losses in recent years management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event the consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral this adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan chargeoff trends as well as those of the general banking industry management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio as of december we provided qualitative adjustments as detailed in the table below further information regarding these qualitative adjustments is provided in our form 10k table start qfactor adjustment model overlays office

million in and a net credit loss expense related to loans totaling million in net credit loss expensebenefit for each portfolio segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net chargeoffs have been recognized the net credit loss benefit related to loans during primarily reflects a decrease in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans primarily related to a decrease in expected credit losses related to certain pandemic impacted industries and a reduction in the minimum reserve ratio for our commercial real estate owner occupied portfolio the impact of this decrease was partly offset by an increase in expected credit losses associated with commercial and industrial loans primarily related to the downside scenario overlay discussed above and increases in modeled losses for our commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate and consumer real estate portfolios the net credit loss benefit related to loans during primarily reflects improvements in forecasted economic conditions and oil price trends relative to the prevailing conditions in as well as a decrease in net chargeoffs credit loss expense related to loans during reflected the uncertain future impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices as well as the level of net chargeoffs the expected deterioration in credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was also excluding ppp loans at december compared to excluding ppp loans at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled million and million at december and december respectively the level of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments underlying risk grades the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled million during compared to million during and million during the increase in credit loss expense during the comparable periods primarily reflects increases in overall offbalancesheet credit exposures credit loss expense for offbalancesheet credit exposures in was also partly impacted by

future cash flow needs as they become due the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds the objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost we seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through assetliability management which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future liquid assets include cash interestbearing deposits in banks securities available for sale maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity and federal funds sold and resell agreements liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to frost bank as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs as of december we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of december based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at december we had approximately billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the federal reserve discount window as needed as of december management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or operations in addition management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us in the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of december these include payments related to i longterm borrowings note borrowed funds ii operating leases note premises and equipment and lease commitments iii time deposits with stated maturity dates note deposits and iv commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit note offbalancesheet arrangements commitments guarantees and contingencies since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends at december cullenfrost had liquid assets including cash and resell agreements totaling million regulatory and economic policies our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities among other things the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits for that reason alone the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on our earnings governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future however we cannot accurately predict the nature timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings accounting standards updates see note accounting standards updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements
