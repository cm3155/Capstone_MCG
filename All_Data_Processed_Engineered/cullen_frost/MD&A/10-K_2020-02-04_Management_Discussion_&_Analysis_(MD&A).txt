our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items table end forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio our allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic receivables and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with asc topic contingencies the level of the allowance reflects managements continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio as well as trends in the foregoing portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits however the entire allowance is available for any credit that in managements judgment should be charged off while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our loan portfolio the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications see the section captioned allowance for loan losses elsewhere in this discussion and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of december and and results of operations for each of the years then ended refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february the form 10k for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report from time to time we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary none of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and as such the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable

in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general

significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in nonetheless we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result see item quantitative and qualitative

understanding the borrowers ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower the cash flows of borrowers however may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee however some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production energy services and other energy loans which includes private clients transportation and equipment providers manufacturers refiners and traders the origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans because however of the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy production loans are secured by proven developed and producing reserves loan proceeds are used for the development and drilling of additional wells the acquisition of additional production andor the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled our customers in this sector are generally large independent private ownerproducers or large corporate producers these borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions and as such loans in this portfolio are generally greater than million production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower collateral values are determined by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower collateral is calculated at least semiannually using third party engineerprepared reserve studies these reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas to qualify as collateral typically reserves must be proven developed and producing for certain borrowers collateral may include up to proven nonproducing reserves loan commitments are limited to of estimated reserve value cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within of the halflife of the underlying reserves loan commitments generally must also be covered by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at of our base case price assumptions in addition the ratio of the borrowers debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda should generally not exceed oil and gas service transportation and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas we mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment borrowers in this sector are typically privatelyowned middlemarket companies with annual sales of less than million the services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified and include downhole testing and maintenance providing and threading drilling pipe hydraulic fracturing services or equipment seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector our private client portfolio primarily consists of loans to wealthy individuals and their related oil and gas exploration and production entities where the oil and gas producing reserves are not considered to be the primary source of repayment these borrowers and guarantors typically have significant sources of wealth including significant liquid assets andor cash flow from other investments which can fully repay the loans the credit structures of these loans are generally similar to those of energy production loans described above with respect to the valuation of the reserves taken as collateral and the repayment structures although no balances were outstanding at december and in prior years we have had a small portfolio of loans to refiners where our credit involvement with these customers was through purchases of shared national credit syndications these borrowers refine crude oil into gasoline diesel jet fuel asphalt and other petrochemicals and are not dependent on drilling or development all of the borrowers in this portfolio are very large public companies that are important employers in several of our major markets these borrowers for the most part have been longterm customers and we have a strong relationship with these companies and their executive management there is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships we also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil gas other petrochemicals and ethanol these companies are not dependent on drilling or development as a general policy we do not lend to energy traders however we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders backtoback trading as such the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated there is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those of real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location within texas this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria as a general rule we avoid financing singlepurpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve in addition management tracks the level of owneroccupied commercial real estate loans versus nonowner occupied loans at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owneroccupied properties with respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by nonowner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies independent appraisal reviews sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project these estimates may be inaccurate construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be precommitted permanent loans from approved longterm lenders sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we originate consumer loans utilizing a computerbased credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers minimizes risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements which include but are not limited to loantovalue limitations collection remedies the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements we maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans increased million or during compared to our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including i the development and production of oil or natural gas ii providing oil and gas field servicing iii providing energyrelated transportation services iv providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling v refining petrochemicals or vi trading oil gas and related commodities energy loans increased million or during compared to the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly

populated cities in the united states these market areas are also home to a significant number of fortune companies as a result we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business we consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million excluding treasury management lines exposure prior to any portion being sold large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million in addition to our normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits one of our regional credit committees must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures between million and million our central credit committee must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and

enable us to effectively manage the loan portfolio by providing the flexibility to respond to liquidity needs changes in interest rates and changes in underwriting standards and loan structures among other things due to the shorterterm nature of such loans from time to time and in the ordinary course of business we will renewextend maturing lines of credit or refinance existing loans at their maturity dates some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need these renewals extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards such borrowers typically request renewals to support their ongoing working capital needs to finance their operations such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally could obtain similar financing from another financial institution in connection with each renewal extension or refinancing we may require a principal reduction adjust the rate of interest andor modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricingstructuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial institutions in such cases we do not generally grant concessions and except for those reported in note loans any such renewals extensions or refinancings that occurred during the reported periods were not deemed to be troubled debt restructurings pursuant to applicable accounting guidance loans exceeding million undergo a complete underwriting process at each renewal nonperforming assets and potential problem loans nonperforming assets yearend nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows table start nonaccrual loans commercial and industrial

relationship was first reported as a potential problem loan during the third quarter of there were no nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans in excess of million at december nonaccrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of million totaling million at december this included a single credit relationship totaling million that was classified as nonaccrual during the third quarter of the other credit relationship which totaled million at december was previously reported as nonaccrual with an aggregate balance of million at december we charged off million related to this credit relationship during nonaccrual energy loans at december included one other credit relationship in excess of million totaling million nonaccrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities there were no nonaccrual commercial real estate loans in excess of million at december nonaccrual commercial real estate loans included one relationship in excess of million totaling million at december this credit relationship was sold during the second quarter of generally loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due andor management deems the collectibility of the principal andor interest to be in question as well as when required by regulatory requirements once interest accruals are discontinued accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure writedowns occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines writedowns are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties there were no writedowns of foreclosed assets in while writedowns totaled thousand and thousand during and respectively there were no significant concentrations of any properties to which the aforementioned writedowns relate in any single geographic region accruing past due loans at december decreased million compared to december the decrease was primarily related to decreases in past due commercial real estate loans down million and past due commercial and industrial loans down million potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligors potential operating or financial difficulties management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis at december and we had million and million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the nonaccrual restructured or days past due loan categories at december potential problem loans consisted of ten credit relationships of the total outstanding balance at december was related to the restaurant industry was related to the energy industry was related to the real estate industry and was related to building contractors weakness in these organizations operating performance and financial condition among other factors have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits as such all of the loans identified as potential problem loans at december were graded as substandard accrual risk grade potential problem loans impact the allocation of our allowance for loan losses as a result of our risk grade based allocation methodology see note loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details regarding our allowance allocation methodology allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of inherent losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio our allowance for loan losses consists of i specific valuation allowances determined in accordance with asc topic receivables based on probable losses on specific loans ii historical valuation allowances determined in accordance with asc topic contingencies based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends adjusted as necessary to reflect the impact of current conditions iii general valuation allowances determined in accordance with asc topic based on various risk factors that are internal to us and iv macroeconomic valuation allowances determined in accordance with asc topic based upon managements assessment of current and expected economic conditions trends and other quantitative and qualitative portfolio risk factors that are external to us or that are not otherwise captured in our allowance modeling process but could impact the credit risk or inherent losses within our loan portfolio segments our model for the determination of the allowance for loan losses is largely prescriptive based on policy and calculated using quantitative data related to our loan portfolio this calculation yields the minimum level of allowance required minimum calculated need in that the model is constructed to address aspects of the loan portfolio quantitatively as they move over time both good and bad the model output of the minimum calculated need will move directionally with the overall health of the portfolio and inherent losses in the portfolio at any period end while the model inherently captures loan portfolio characteristics and actions such as risk grade migration required specific reserves net chargeoffs among other things the model contains a degree of imprecision arising from various items and portfolio risk factors that are not and cannot be incorporated in to the model but nonetheless have an impact on the overall level of allowance deemed appropriate by management to adequately address this imprecision our methodology to determine the allowance for loan losses provides for additional reserves in excess of the minimum calculated need this process entails the application of management judgment related to various nonmodel items and portfolio risk factors not addressed by the quantitative model but reflective of inherent losses in the portfolio these additional reserves which are reported as a component of our macroeconomic valuation allowances are determined at the portfolio level and allocated as reserves for general economic risk to our various portfolio segments based upon management judgment on january we adopted a new accounting standard which replaces the incurred loss model for measuring credit losses discussed above with a new expected loss model see note accounting standard updates in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for additional details the table below provides an allocation of the yearend allowance for loan losses by loan type however allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories see note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further details regarding our methodology for estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts allocated to specific

the financing needs of our customers these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures we also hold certain assets which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets including assets held in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers commitments to extend

of equity securities elsewhere in this report liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds the objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost we seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through assetliability management which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future liquid assets include cash interestbearing deposits in banks securities available for sale maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity and federal funds sold and resell agreements liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to frost bank as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs as of december management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or operations in addition management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends at december cullenfrost had liquid assets including cash and resell agreements totaling million impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap gaap presently requires us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs in managements opinion changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including changes in the expected rate of inflation the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities among other things as further discussed in the next section regulatory and economic policies our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities among other things the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits for that reason alone the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on our earnings governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future however we cannot accurately predict the nature timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings accounting standards updates see note accounting standards updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements
