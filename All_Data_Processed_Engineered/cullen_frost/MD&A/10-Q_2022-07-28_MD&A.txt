impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and our results thereof as well as the impact on our financial position and ii legislative and regulatory actions taken related to the covid19 pandemic particularly as they relate to the banking and financial services industry application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets refer to the form 10k for additional information regarding critical accounting policies overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share for the

shareholders increased million or for the three months ended june and decreased million or for the six months ended june compared to the same periods in the increase during the three months ended june was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense and a million increase in income tax expense the decrease during the six months ended june was primarily the result of a million increase in noninterest expense and a million increase in income tax expense partly offset by a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first six months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions as of june approximately of our loans had a fixed interest rate while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to the prime interest rate approximately or the london interbank offered rate libor approximately we discontinued originating liborbased loans effective december and have begun to negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index the american interbank offered rate ameribor a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange the secured overnight financing rate sofr or a benchmark developed by bloomberg index services bsby as of june approximately of loans were tied to one of these indexes for our currently outstanding liborbased loans the timing and manner in which each customers contract transitions from libor to another rate will vary on a casebycase basis our goal is to complete all transitions by the first quarter of select average market rates for the periods indicated are presented in the table below three months ended june six months ended june federal funds target rate upper

increased to we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report

to an increase in the consumer overlay which is further discussed below as more fully described in our form 10k we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of june we utilized the moodys analytics june consensus scenario the june consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the june consensus scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the june consensus scenario projections included among other things i us nominal gross domestic product annualized quarterly growth rate of in the second half of followed by average annualized quarterly growth rates of in and through the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of ii average us

classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the weightedaverage risk grade for energy loans decreased to at june from at december the decrease in the weighted average risk grade was

increased million while the weightedaverage risk grade of such loans decreased from at december to june commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention decreased million and classified commercial real estate loans decreased million as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys june consensus scenario for our estimated expected credit losses as of june and the moodys december consensus scenario for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qualitative factor or qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon managements judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of june modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately resulting in a million total adjustment compared to at december which resulted in a million total adjustment the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at june was based on a limited negative expected impact on our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios related to changes in loan portfolio concentrations a limited negative expected impact on all of our loan portfolios related to changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies changes in risk grades and adverse classifications a limited negative expected impact on our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios related to the potential deterioration of collateral values no expected impact related to our commercial and industrial and consumer portfolios a negative expected impact associated with national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions and no impact to any of our loan portfolios related to changes lending policies procedures and underwriting standards except for our consumer and other portfolio which was limited negative and loan portfolio attributes among other things we have also provided additional qualitative adjustments or management overlays as of june as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio qfactor and other qualitative adjustments as of june are detailed in the table below qfactor adjustment model overlays office building overlays downside scenario overlay credit concentration overlays consumer overlay total commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied construction consumer real estate consumer and other total model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effect of unusually large positive changes in certain economic variables used by our commercial real estate credit loss models these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate owner occupied commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longerterm concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the longterm performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of or worse the downside scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation labor shortages disruption in financial markets and global supply chains further oil price volatility and the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the current war between russia and ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior including borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices to determine this qualitative adjustment we use an alternative more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models as of june we used the moodys analytics june s3 alternative scenario downside 90th percentile the june s3 scenario in modeling expected credit losses using this scenario we also assume each loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level the qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense adjusted based upon managements assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature timing and amount management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large concentrated credit losses in recent years management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event the consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral this adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan chargeoff trends as well as those of the general banking industry management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio as of december we provided qualitative adjustments as detailed in the table below further information regarding these qualitative adjustments is provided in our form 10k qfactor adjustment model overlays office

ended june while no net credit loss expense or benefit was recognized during the same period in net credit loss expensebenefit for each portfolio segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net chargeoffs have been recognized the net credit loss expense related to loans during the first six months of primarily reflects increases in expected credit losses associated with commercial and industrial loans primarily related to the downside scenario overlay discussed above and consumer and other loans primarily related to an increase in modeled losses as well as the level of net chargeoffs associated with these loan portfolio segments the impact of these items was partly offset by a decrease in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans primarily related to a decrease in expected credit losses related to certain pandemic impacted industries and a reduction in the minimum reserve ratio for our commercial real estate owner occupied portfolio the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was excluding ppp loans at june compared to excluding ppp loans at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled approximately million and million at june and december respectively the level of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments underlying risk grades the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures are further described in our form 10k we recognized a net credit loss benefit related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling thousand during the six months ended june compared to a net credit loss expense of million during the same period in capital and liquidity capital shareholders equity totaled billion and billion at june and december respectively the decrease was primarily related to the accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss component of shareholders equity which decreased to a net aftertax unrealized loss of million at june from a net aftertax unrealized gain of million at december the change was primarily due to a billion net aftertax decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale other uses of capital during the six months ended june included million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock and thousand of treasury stock purchases sources of capital during the six months ended june included net income of million million in proceeds from stock option exercises and million related to stockbased compensation under the basel iii capital rules we have elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital accordingly amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios in connection with the adoption of asc on january we also elected to exclude for a transitional period the effects of credit loss accounting under cecl in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet items see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we paid a quarterly dividend of per common share during each of the first and second quarters of and a quarterly dividend of per common share during each of the first and second quarters of these dividend amounts equate to a common stock dividend payout ratio of and during the first six months of and respectively our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report stock repurchase plans from time to time our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans in general stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards on january our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a oneyear period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions no shares have been repurchased under this plan or under a prior plan during the reported periods see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds each included elsewhere in this report liquidity as more fully discussed in our form 10k our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits supplemented by our shortterm and longterm borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization as of june we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of june based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at june we had approximately billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the federal reserve discount window as needed since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note
