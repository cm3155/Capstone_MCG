prior to that date and it may not accept any new loan applications we are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the us government application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets refer to the form 10k for additional information regarding critical accounting policies overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share for the three and six months ended june compared to million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share for the three and six months ended june selected data for the comparable periods was as follows three months ended june six months ended june

increased million or for the three months ended june and increased million or for the six months ended june compared to the same periods in the increase during the three months ended june was primarily the result of a million decrease in credit loss expense a million increase in noninterest income and an million increase in net interest income partly offset by a million increase in income tax expense and a million increase in noninterest expense the increase during the six months ended june was primarily the result of a million decrease in credit loss expense and a million increase in net interest income partly offset by a million decrease in noninterest income a million increase in income tax expense and a million increase in noninterest expense credit loss expense during was impacted by both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices noninterest income during was impacted by a million net gain on securities transactions during the first quarter net income available to common shareholders during was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first six months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and decreased basis points in march to where it remained through june our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the london interbank offered rate libor at june the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively while at june the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively the target range for the federal funds rate which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds began at to and decreased basis points in march to zero to where it remained through june as noted in our form 10k the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents the changes in taxableequivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each the comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period as further

interest income for the six months ended june increased million or compared to the same periods in taxableequivalent net interest income for the six months ended june included days compared to days for the same period in as a result of the leap year the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during the six months ended june excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective increase in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the six months ended june the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six months ended june the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income during the three months ended june was primarily related to an increase in the average taxableequivalent yield on loans and decreases in the average costs of interestbearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and taxable securities the impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average volume of taxexempt securities and loans combined with a decrease in the average yield on taxable securities the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income during the six months ended june was primarily related to increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve combined with decreases in the average costs of interestbearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds the positive impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average yields on loans interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and taxable securities combined with decreases in the average volumes of taxexempt and taxable securities and an increase in the average volume of interestbearing deposit liabilities the decreases in taxableequivalent net interest margin during the three and six months ended june were primarily related to increases in the relative proportion of average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve to average total interestearning assets combined with the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates interestbearing deposits made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended june compared to during the same period in while interestbearing deposits made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the six months ended june compared to during the same period in the average volume of interestearning assets for the three

reserve and a million increase in average taxable securities partly offset by a million decrease in average taxexempt securities a million decrease in average loans and a million decrease in average federal funds sold the increase in the average volume of interestearning assets during the six months ended june included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve a billion increase in average loans of which approximately billion related to ppp loans as further discussed below partly offset by a million decrease in average taxexempt securities a million decrease in average taxable securities and a million decrease in average federal funds sold the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six months ended june the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets during was impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interestearning assets the average taxableequivalent yield on loans increased basis points from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the average taxableequivalent yield on loans decreased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six months ended june the average taxableequivalent yields on loans during the three and six months ended june were positively impacted by higher average yields on ppp loans but negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates compared to the same periods in the average volume of loans for the three and six months ended june decreased million or and increased billion or respectively compared to the same periods in loans made up approximately and of average interestearning assets during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to and during the same respective periods in in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act in we funded billion of ppp loans of which approximately million were funded during the second quarter of as of june approximately billion of these originated ppp loans have been forgiven by the sba or repaid by the customer during the first six months of we funded an additional billion of ppp loans as of june approximately million of these originated ppp loans have been forgiven by the sba or repaid by the customer during the three and six months ended june we recognized million and million respectively in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans during the three months ended june we recognized approximately million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yield on ppp loans was and during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans the average yield on ppp loans during the three months ended june was the increase in the average yield on ppp loans during the three months ended june compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in the average expected lives of the ppp loans funded in compared to furthermore the average fee percentage for originations was higher due to a smaller average loan size relative to for ppp loans funded through june we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected lives of these loans of this amount we expect to recognize approximately in and the remainder in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the three months ended june decreasing basis points from during the same period in while the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the six months ended june decreasing basis points from during the same period in the average yield on taxable securities decreased basis points from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the average

volume of total securities during the six months ended june decreased million or compared to the same period in securities made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended june compared to during the same period in while securities made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the six months ended june compared to during the same period in the decreases during the three and six months ended june were primarily related to an increase in the relative proportion of interestearning assets invested in interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve for the three months ended june increased billion or compared to the same period in while average interestbearing deposits for the six months ended june increased billion or compared to the same period in interestbearing

average interestearning assets during the six months ended june compared to during the same period in the increases in the average volume of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in were primarily due to increases in the average volume of customer deposits and to a lesser extent repurchase agreements the average yield on interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve was and during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to and during the same periods in the average yield on interestbearing deposits during and during the second quarter of were negatively impacted by a decrease

deposits was and respectively during the three months ended june compared to and respectively during the same period in the average cost of interestbearing deposits and total deposits was and respectively during the six months ended june compared to and respectively during the same period in the average cost of deposits during and were impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interestbearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates in april we borrowed an aggregate billion from the federal home loan bank fhlb to provide additional liquidity in light of our significant ppp lending volume these advances were subsequently paidoff in may as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary average fhlb advances totaled million during the second quarter of while the average cost of these advances was the cost of the advances was partly offset by dividends received on the fhlb stock we were required to purchase in connection with the advances the fhlb stock was redeemed in connection with the repayment of the advances our net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was and during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to and during same periods in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our net interest income and net interest margin have been and we currently expect them to continue to be impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the ongoing economic disruption arising from the covid19 pandemic notwithstanding the foregoing our participation in the ppp as discussed above is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposures after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows three months ended june six months ended june credit loss expense benefit related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures noninterest income total noninterest income for the three and six months ended june increased million or and decreased million or respectively compared to the same periods in excluding the

increased million or respectively compared to the same periods in investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees for the first six months of and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended june was primarily due to increases in investment management fees up million or and estate fees up million the increase in trust and investment management fees during the six months ended june was primarily due to increases in investment management fees up million or investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets the increases in investment management fees during the three and six months ended june were primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as an increases in the number of accounts the increase in estate fees during the three months ended june was primarily related to variation in transaction volumes at june trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of assets fixed income securities of assets alternative investments of assets and cash equivalents of assets the estimated fair value of these assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at june compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december and billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at june service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended june increased million or while service charges on deposit accounts for the six months ended june decreased thousand or compared to the same periods in the increase during the three months ended june was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts up thousand and thousand respectively and an increase in commercial service charges up thousand the decrease during the six months ended june was primarily related to decreases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts down million and thousand respectively partly offset by an increase in commercial service charges up million overdraft charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during the three months ended june compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the same period in overdraft charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during the six months ended june compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the same period in the fluctuations in overdraft charges during the three and six months ended june were primarily related to fluctuations in the volumes of overdrafts relative to the same periods in in april we implemented a new overdraft grace feature for certain consumer demand deposit accounts whereby no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of or less subject to certain qualifying conditions such as a minimum direct deposit this new feature reduced overdraft charges on consumer accounts during the second quarter of by approximately million the impact on future quarters will depend on future overdraft volumes commercial service charges increased thousand and million during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in commercial service charges during the three months ended june were impacted by an increase in the volume of billable services relative to the same period in commercial service charges during the six months ended june were primarily impacted by a lower average earnings credit rate the earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged because average market interest rates in have been lower compared to deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees for the three and six months ended june increased thousand or and increased thousand or respectively compared to the same periods in the increase during the three months ended june was the result of an increase in commission income up thousand partly offset by a decrease in contingent income down thousand the increase during the six months ended june was the result of an increase in contingent income up thousand partly offset by a decrease in commission income down thousand the increase in commission income during the three months ended june was primarily related to an increase in life insurance commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions mostly offset by decreases in benefit plan commissions the decrease in commission income during the six months ended june was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions mostly offset by increases in life insurance commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions the increases in commercial lines property and casualty commissions were related to increased market rates while the increases in life insurance commissions and decreases in benefit plan commissions were related to fluctuations in business volumes contingent income totaled thousand and million during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to thousand and million during the same periods in contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed these performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year this performance related contingent income totaled million and million during the six months ended june and respectively the increase in performance related contingent income during was related to growth within the portfolio combined with improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed during the first quarter of a severe weather event in texas resulted in a significant increase in property and casualty claims and losses this deterioration in loss performance is expected to impact the determination of performance related contingent payments we receive in however such impact is not determinable at this time contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated andor the subsequent retention of such business this benefit plan related contingent income totaled thousand and thousand during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to thousand and thousand during the same periods in respectively interchange and card transaction fees interchange fees or swipe fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing

given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of june we utilized the moodys analytics june consensus scenario the june consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the june consensus scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the june consensus scenario projections included among other things i us gross domestic product gdp annualized quarterly growth rates of and in the third and fourth quarters of respectively followed by annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of to during and an average annualized growth rate of through the end of the forecast period in the second quarter

second quarter of in estimating expected credit losses as of december we utilized the moodys analytics december baseline scenario the december baseline scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the december baseline scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the december baseline scenario projections included among

our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys consensus scenario for june for our estimated expected credit losses as of june and the moodys baseline scenario for december for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of june modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately down slightly from approximately at december the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at june was based on a neutral expected impact related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values a negative expected impact associated with national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions in the first quarter of unprecedented economic conditions due to the covid19 pandemic and oil and gas price volatility resulted in significant spikes in the unemployment rate and the level of unemployment claims as well as severe declines in the level of the us and texas gdps among other things in some cases our expected credit loss models consider these economic variables on a three to fourquarter lag basis as of june the significant spikes in several of these variables are no longer impacting our model results however as the economy has entered recovery the models are now being impacted by exceptionally positive changes in certain variables which has resulted in lower estimates of expected credit losses notwithstanding the foregoing management believes there are still significant headwinds impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio as a result we have provided additional qualitative adjustments for certain categories of loans as further described below as of june we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans graded watch risk grade special mention risk grade and substandardaccrual risk grade this adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations we also perform an analysis of our customers secondary sources of capital as a result of the estimated borrowing base deficiencies for the identified credits we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of approximately million for energy production loans at june using a similar methodology though for all energy production loans not limited to certain risk grades as described in our form 10k we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans of approximately million at december we performed a separate assessment of other nonproduction energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics equipment manufacturing and other services among other things this assessment included a review of customer liquidity and cash flows as well as various debt ratios through this review we were able to identify a small pool of borrowers that management considered to have an elevated level of risk as a result of this elevated level of risk management provided an additional qualitative adjustment for other nonproduction energy loans of approximately thousand at june no additional qualitative adjustment for nonproduction energy loans was made as of december our commercial real estate oversight council in its oversight and assessment of the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolios believes these portfolios continue to have an elevated level of risk notwithstanding recent economic stimulus efforts by federal and state governments as of june we provided additional qualitative adjustments totaling million for various categories of our commercial real estate loan portfolio this amount includes million for owneroccupied commercial real estate loans million for nonowneroccupied commercial real estate loans and million for commercial real estate construction loans these additional qualitative adjustments are largely related to the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic as further discussed below and to a lesser extent to compensate for the effect of the positive changes in certain economic variables used by our credit loss models which has resulted in significantly lower estimates of expected credit losses beyond a level that management deems appropriate given the significant headwinds management believes are still impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate nonetheless by late the markets in which we operate had substantially reopened aside from the energy industry which is discussed above we lend to customers operating in certain other industries detailed in the table below that have been and are expected to continue to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk associated with these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment related to the effects of the covid19 pandemic totaling million as of june of which million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans these amounts are included in the totals detailed above as of december we provided a similar additional qualitative adjustment totaling million the details of which are described in our form 10k these industries that management believes are particularly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic are presented in the following table as of june and december and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while ppp loans are excluded outstanding balance percentage of total loans excluding ppp loans allocated allowance allocated allowance as a percentage of outstanding balance june hotelslodging restaurants

portfolio totaling million of which million was included in the million additional qualitative adjustment for covid19 impacted industries discussed above an additional million was provided based upon managements assessment of the risk associated with the longterm sustainability of borrowers within our small business commercial and industrial portfolio the majority of these borrowers have been bolstered by ppp funding from the sba which has helped them to sustain their operations amid ongoing pandemicrelated shutdowns and other restrictions nonetheless management believes there is a significant amount of uncertainty associated with the longterm viability of many of these businesses when this government supplemented funding runs out furthermore on march the covid19 bankruptcy relief extension act of was enacted extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the cares act of until march these provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief in that regard we also provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio totaling million in light of the level of unsecured

expected deterioration in credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was excluding ppp loans at june compared to excluding ppp loans at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled approximately million and million at june and december respectively the level of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding
