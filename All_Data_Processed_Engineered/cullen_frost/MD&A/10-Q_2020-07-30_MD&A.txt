liquidity and results of operations may constitute forwardlooking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ possibly materially from what is reflected in those forwardlooking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control including the scope and duration of the pandemic actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers clients third parties and us forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events recent developments related to covid19 overview our business has been and continues to be impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of covid19 in march covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the president of the united states efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have led to shelterinplace orders the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate as the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature there are many uncertainties related to covid19 including among other things its ultimate geographic spread its severity the duration of the outbreak the impact to our customers employees and vendors the impact to the financial services and banking industry and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken or that may yet be taken or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact both economic and healthrelated covid19 has negatively affected and is expected to continue to negatively affect our business financial position and operating results in light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time but it has been and is expected to continue to be material impact on our operations in the state of texas many jurisdictions have declared health emergencies the resulting closures andor limited operations of nonessential businesses and related economic disruption has impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers financial services have been identified as a critical infrastructure sector by the department of homeland security accordingly our business remains open to address the issues arising as a result of covid19 and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees we have implemented our business continuity and health emergency response plans among other things significant actions taken under these plans include implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations restricted all nonessential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area temporarily closed all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to nonemployees except for certain limited cases by appointment only we continue to serve our consumer and business customers through our motorbanks atms internet banking mobile app and telephone customer service capabilities expanded remoteaccess availability so that nearly all of our workforce has the capability to work from home or other remote locations all activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization table of co ntents notwithstanding the foregoing actions the covid19 outbreak could still greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism particularly among key personnel further limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices operational technical or securityrelated risks arising from a remote workforce and government or regulatory agency orders among other things the business and operations of our third party service providers many of whom perform critical services for our business could also be significantly impacted which in turn could impact us as a result we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of covid19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown andor beyond our control impact on our financial position and results of operations our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations the availability of our workforce the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us while its effects continue to materialize the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally this decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers including affected businesses and individuals vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us the national public health crisis arising from the covid19 pandemic and public expectations about it combined with certain preexisting factors including but not limited to international trade disputes inflation risks and oil price volatility could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate the resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions such as the unemployment rate which in turn are likely to impact our borrowers creditworthiness and our ability to make loans see further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned loans and allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion in addition the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction we lend to customers operating in such industries including energy restaurants hotelslodging aviation entertainment retail and commercial real estate among others that have been significantly impacted by covid19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely to help mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments or portions thereof for up to days after days customers may apply for an additional deferral additionally the temporary closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at reopened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing facetoface interaction our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors the potential changes in behaviors driven by covid19 also present heightened liquidity risks for example arising from increased demand for our products and services such as unusually high draws on credit facilities or decreased demand for our products and services such as idiosyncratic or broadbased market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows legislative and regulatory developments recent actions taken by the federal government and the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of covid19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations these actions are further discussed below in an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 the federal reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to effective on march this action by the federal reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of to effective on march our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds as our balance sheet is more asset sensitive our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings the decline in interest rates has already led to new alltime low yields across the us treasury maturity curve in june the federal reserve indicated that it expects to maintain the targeted federal funds rate at current levels through nonetheless if the federal reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of covid19 overall interest rates will decline further which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin table of co ntents other actions taken by the federal reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by covid19 include expanded reverse repo operations adding liquidity to the banking system restarted quantitative easing lowered the interest rate on the discount window by to reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend introduced and expanded several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity the us government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the covid19 the phase legislation the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act was enacted on march and among other things authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures the phase legislation the families first coronavirus response act was enacted on march and provides for paid sickmedical leave establishes nocost coverage for coronavirus testing expands unemployment benefits expands food assistance and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic among other provisions the phase legislation the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was enacted on march among other provisions the cares act i authorizes the secretary of the treasury to make loans loan guarantees and other investments up to billion for assistance to eligible businesses states and municipalities with limited targeted relief for passenger air carriers cargo air carriers and businesses critical to maintaining national security ii creates a billion loan program called the paycheck protection program the ppp for loans to small businesses for among other things payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments iii provides certain credits against the personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents iv expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each state and v expands telehealth services in medicare the phase legislation the paycheck protection program and healthcare enhancement act of the ppphe act was enacted on april among other things the ppphe act provided an additional billion of funding for the ppp of which billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between billion and billion the paycheck protection program flexibility act of the pppf act was enacted in june and modifies the ppp as follows i establishes a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the pppf act and permits an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree ii extends the covered period of the cares act from june to december iii extends the eightweek covered period for expenditures that qualify for forgiveness to the earlier of weeks following loan origination or december iv extends the deferral period for payment of principal interest and fees to the date on which the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the sba v requires the borrower to use at least down from of the proceeds of the loan for payroll costs and up to up from for other permitted purposes as a condition to obtaining forgiveness of the loan vi delays from june to december the date by which employees must be rehired to avoid a reduction in the amount of forgiveness of a loan and creates a rehiring safe harbor that allows businesses to remain eligible for loan forgiveness if they make a goodfaith attempt to rehire employees or hire similarly qualified employees but are unable to do so or are able to document an inability to return to precovid19 levels of business activity due to compliance with social distancing measures and vii allows borrowers to receive both loan forgiveness under the ppp and the payroll tax deferral permitted under the cares act rather than having to choose which of the two would be more advantageous in july the cares act was amended to extend through august the sbas authority to make commitments under the ppp the sbas existing authority had previously expired on june we are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the us government the federal reserve has created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by covid19 the programs include among other things i the ppp facility which is intended to extend loans to banks making ppp loans ii the municipal liquidity facility which is intended to facilitate the purchase of eligible notes from states and certain counties and cities around the country and iii the main street lending program mslp which is intended to facilitate credit flows to businesses affected by the covid19 pandemic with up to employees or up to billion in annual revenues as more fully discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion we are currently participating in the ppp as a lender additionally we are currently evaluating participation in the mslp table of co ntents banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets this disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein such impacts could be material furthermore bank regulatory agencies have been and are expected to continue to be very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers especially borrowers as shown during and following the financial crisis of periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations we are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements furthermore provisions of the cares act allow but do not require the fdic to guarantee deposit obligations of banks in noninterestbearing transaction accounts through december participation in any such guarantee program may result in fees and other assessments as the fdic determines and may include special assessments other provisions of the cares act as well as actions taken by bank regulators such as potential relief for working with borrowers who are distressed as a result of the effects of covid19 could similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with asc that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets for additional information regarding critical accounting policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields table of co ntents results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share for the three and six months ended june

available to common shareholders decreased million or for the three months ended june and decreased million or for the six months ended june compared to the same periods in the decrease during the three months ended june was primarily the result of a million increase in credit loss expense a million decrease in net interest income and a million decrease in noninterest income partly offset by a million decrease in income tax expense and a million decrease in noninterest expense the decrease during the six months ended june was primarily the result of a million increase in credit loss expense an million increase in noninterest expense and a million decrease in net interest income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest income and a million decrease in income tax expense the increase in credit loss expense during the comparable periods resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices the increase in noninterest income during the six months ended june was primarily related to a million net gain on securities transactions net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended june was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock in the first quarter details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first six months of excluding the revenue associated with the million net gain on securities transactions realized during the first quarter of net interest income would have represented of total revenue during the first six months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin table of co ntents the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at during the prime rate decreased basis points in march to where it remained through june our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the london interbank

each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at to during the target range for the federal funds rate decreased basis points in march to zero to where it remained through june as noted in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents the changes in taxableequivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each the comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period as further discussed below three months ended

the same period in as a result of the leap year the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during the six months ended june excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the six months ended june the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six months ended june the decreases in taxableequivalent net interest income and taxableequivalent net interest margin during the three and six months ended june were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and resell agreements combined with decreases in the average volume of taxable securities based on amortized cost and increases in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities and for the three months ended june a decrease in the average volumes of taxexempt securities the impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average cost of interestbearing deposits and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and for the six months ended june increases in the average yields on taxable and taxexempt securities the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended june increased billion while the average volume of interestearning assets for the six months ended june increased billion compared to the same periods in respectively the increase in the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended june included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements a billion increase in average loans of which approximately billion related to ppp loans as further discussed below and a million increase in average taxexempt securities partly offset by a billion decrease in average taxable securities the increase in the average volume of interestearning assets for the six months ended june included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements a billion increase in average loans of which billion related to ppp loans as further discussed below and a million increase in average

ended june to during the three months ended june while the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six

billion or and billion or compared to the same periods in loans made up approximately and of average interestearning assets during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to and during the same periods in respectively as discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act through june we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans during the second quarter of we recognized approximately million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yield on ppp loans was approximately during the second quarter of compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans as of june we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the three months ended june increasing basis points from during the same period in while the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the six months ended june increasing basis points from during the same period in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities during the three and six months ended june was positively impacted by increases in the average yields on taxexempt securities and for the six months taxable securities as a result of investments in higheryielding longerduration securities and an increase in the relative proportion taxexempt securities to total securities the average yield on taxable securities remained unchanged at during the three months ended june and while the average yield on taxable securities increased basis points from during the six months ended june to during the six months ended june this increase during the six months ended june resulted as the proceeds from the maturity of a significant volume of us treasury securities during the second half of were reinvested in higheryielding residential mortgagebacked securities the average taxableequivalent yield on taxexempt securities increased basis point from during the three months ended june to during the three months ended june while the average taxableequivalent yield on taxexempt securities increased basis points

made up approximately and of average interestearning assets during the three and six months ended june respectively compared to and during the three and six months ended june respectively the increases in the average volume of interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve during the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in primarily due to an increase in the average volume of deposits and other borrowed funds and the proceeds from the sale of securities the combined average yield on interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements was and during the three and six months ended june respectively

interest rates in april we borrowed an aggregate billion from the federal home loan bank fhlb to provide additional liquidity in light of our significant ppp lending volume these advances were subsequently paidoff in may as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary average fhlb advances totaled million during the second quarter of while the average cost of these advances was the cost of the advances was partly offset by dividends received on the fhlb stock we were required to purchase in connection with the advances the fhlb stock was redeemed in connection with the repayment of the advances our net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the six months ended june compared to during same period in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our net interest income and net interest margin have been and we currently expect them to continue to be impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the ongoing economic disruption arising from the covid19 pandemic notwithstanding the foregoing our participation in the ppp as discussed above is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposures after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows three months ended june six months ended june credit loss expense related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total credit loss expense for the three and six months ended june was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology

days past due total accruing past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed assets nonperforming assets at june decreased million from december primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual energy loans which for the most part was related to the recognition of chargeoffs as further discussed below generally loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due andor management deems the collectibility of the principal andor interest to be in question as well as when required by regulatory requirements once interest accruals are discontinued accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or

an aggregate balance of million at december nonaccrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of million totaling million at june and two credit relationships in excess of million totaling million at december during the six months ended june we charged off million related to energy loans of that amount million related to credit relationships previously reported as nonaccrual as

to commercial real estate foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure writedowns occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines writedowns are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties writedowns of foreclosed assets totaled thousand during the six months ended june while there were no writedowns of foreclosed assets during the six months ended june accruing past due loans at june increased million compared to december the increase was primarily related to increases in all loan portfolio segments with the largest increases in past due commercial and industrial loans up million consumer real estate up million and commercial real estate loans up million potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligors potential operating or financial difficulties management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis at june and december we had million and million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the nonperforming nonaccrual restructured or days past due loan categories at june potential problem loans consisted of credit relationships of the total outstanding balance at june was related to the energy industry was related to the manufacturing industry and was related to the restaurant industry weakness in these organizations operating performance and financial condition among other factors have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the adverse effects of covid19 in an effort to mitigate these effects loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments or portions thereof for up to days after days customers may apply for an additional deferral in the absence of other intervening factors such shortterm modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to covid19 reported as past due or placed on nonaccrual status provided the loans were not past due or on nonaccrual status prior to the deferral the covid19 pandemic has contributed to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures as a result of the covid19 pandemic a significant number and amount of our loans have experienced ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults we have a significant amount of loans in certain industries that have been particularly impacted these include energy aviation restaurants hotelslodging entertainment retail

elsewhere in this discussion and part ii other information item risk factors elsewhere in this report allowance for credit losses as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans and securities allowances for credit losses are contraasset valuation accounts calculated in accordance with asc that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses cecl on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets for additional information regarding critical accounting policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements table of co ntents allowance for credit losses loans the table below provides as of the dates indicated an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment however allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments june march post asc adoption on january december commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the cecl methodology decreased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model fluctuations in the estimated allowances by portfolio segment offset one another for the most part and as a result the overall estimated amount of allowance for credit losses did not significantly change as a result of the change in methodology the manner in which credit loss allowances are allocated to the individual portfolio segments was partly impacted by a change in the way the underlying loans within each segment are pooled for modeling purposes the impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are now a component of the credit loss models applied to each modeling pool in that regard the amounts allocated to the underlying pools of loans within each portfolio segment more directly reflect the economic variables and portfolio stress factors that correlate with credit losses within each portfolio under the prior methodology allocations in excess of those derived from historical loss rates were recognized as an overlay on each of the various portfolios based upon management judgment nonetheless despite fluctuations in the allocation of portions of the overall allowance to the various portfolio segments the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses within the entire loan portfolio the remainder of this discussion focuses on expected credit losses estimated as of june compared to the post asc estimate of expected credit losses as of january and in some cases march the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled million or of total commercial and industrial loans at june increasing million or compared to million or of total commercial and industrial loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses increased million while qfactor adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans decreased million specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from million post asc adoption on january to million at june the allowance allocated to energy loans totaled million or of total energy loans at june increasing million or compared to million or of total energy loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to energy loans increased million specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled million post asc adoption on january the loans to which these specific allocations were related were subsequently charged off and there were million of specific allocations related to energy loans at june the allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled million or of total commercial real estate loans at june increasing million or compared to million or of total commercial real estate loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to commercial real estate loans decreased million specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit

increased million while qfactor adjustments related to consumer real estate loans decreased thousand the allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled million or of total consumer loans at june increasing million or compared to million or of total consumer loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to consumer loans decreased thousand as more fully described in note loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain table of co ntents macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of june we utilized the moodys analytics june cf consensus scenario the cf scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the cf scenario is based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the cf scenario projections include among other things i a decline in the us gross domestic product gdp in the second quarter of followed by a rebound in the third quarter of ii a us unemployment rate of for in the second quarter of improving to by the fourth quarter of and by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of with texas unemployment rates slightly less at those dates and iii an average year treasury rate of in the second quarter of dropping to a low of in the second quarter of and increasing to by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of the cf scenario also projects average oil prices of per barrel in the second quarter of per barrel in the fourth quarter of per barrel on average for the year in and in the second quarter of for our march estimate of expected credit losses our outlook for oil prices was significantly more negative as a result of the assumed persistence of the oil price war between saudi arabia and russia and increasing oil supplies in the face of decreasing global demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic as a result we used significant qualitative adjustments in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on energy loans though less as of june we continue to make qualitative adjustments related to the impact of oil price volatility in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on energy loans as further discussed below in estimating expected credit losses as of march we utilized the moodys analytics march s8 low oil price scenario the s8 scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the s8 scenario used the moodys baseline forecast updated during the week of march adjusted to assume that the price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil will remain at flat for two years the s8 scenario also assumed the persistence of the oil price war between saudi arabia and russia and increasing oil supplies in the face of decreasing global demand at that time the s8 scenario forecasted declines in the us gross domestic product and the texas gross state product in the second quarter of a flat us unemployment rate for the remainder of and the 10yr treasury rate dropping to in second quarter of and remaining below until the second quarter of the low oil prices incorporated in the s8 scenario also resulted in a forecasted gradual increase in the texas unemployment rate from in the first quarter of to by the first quarter of exceeding the forecasted us unemployment rate of for the first quarter of and reflecting the impact of oil prices on the overall texas economy in late march and early april moodys updated various macroeconomic variables in moodys baseline forecast subsequent to our modeling processes in order to incorporate the expected economic impact of recent developments related to the covid19 pandemic given the level of economic disruption and uncertainty within the state of texas and the nation as a whole arising from the covid19 pandemic and volatility and declines in oil and gas prices driven by decreased demand and increased supply we qualitatively adjusted the model results for these and other risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools as further discussed below the economic forecast used in our initial estimate of expected credit losses under asc on january projected that the texas unemployment rate would remain below through the increases in modeled expected credit losses across all of our loan portfolios as of june compared to the modeled expected credit losses as of our initial adoption of asc on january were primarily the result of changes in our economic forecast particularly forecasts related to unemployment and the gross domestic product as well as changes in portfolio volumes and risk attributes as discussed below the overall loan portfolio excluding ppp loans which are fully guaranteed by the sba increased million or which included a million or increase in commercial real estate loans and a million or increase in consumer real estate loans mostly offset by a million or decrease in commercial and industrial loans a million or decrease in energy loans and a million or decrease in consumer and other loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans did not significantly change totaling at june compared to at december commercial and industrial loans graded watch and special mention risk grades and increased million during the first six months of while classified commercial and industrial loans increased million classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the weightedaverage risk grade for energy loans increased to at june from at december the increase in the weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a million increase in classified energy loans and a million increase in energy loans graded watch and special mention while pass grade energy loans decreased million the weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increased to at june from at december commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention increased million while classified commercial real estate loans increased million table of co ntents as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys cf consensus scenario for june in the second quarter of and the moodys s8 low oil scenario for march in the first quarter of we qualitatively adjust the model results based on this scenario for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of june modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately this weightedaverage qfactor adjustment was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions in connection with our assessment of qfactor adjustments for our initial estimate of expected credit losses upon the adoption of asc on january modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately which included a upward adjustment to modeled expected credit losses related to risks associated with model uncertainty and underprediction this adjustment was based upon the results of certain back testing procedures performed on our credit loss models the qfactor adjustment as of june did not include this additional upward adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty and underprediction while management believes this adjustment is appropriate in a relatively benign or moderately stressful economic environment management nonetheless believes this adjustment is not currently appropriate given the extreme levels and volatility in macroeconomic indicators under the current economic conditions and the fact that such conditions are expected to persist for the foreseeable future the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment totaled approximately as of march and included the adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty and underprediction the decrease in the qfactor adjustment since march reflects the fact that much of these expected credit losses are now captured in our credit loss models as a result of updates in policies and procedures related to managing the effects of covid19 on our loan customers riskgrade migrations and updated macroeconomic forecasts management also made certain other qualitative adjustments for loans within certain industries that are expected to be more significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic and oil price volatility and declines as described below in early march saudi arabia announced significant price discounts on oil which resulted in a sharp decrease in global oil prices including the benchmark wti saudi arabia further announced that it would significantly increase its production leading russia to respond in kind these actions arose in the face of increasing global supplies and decreasing global demand the subsequent worsening global economic outlook and decreased demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic resulted in further decreases in energy prices the wti price per barrel of crude oil was approximately as of june up from per barrel as of march but still down from approximately per barrel as of december in late march we established a special energy oversight council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our energy loan portfolio as of june we provided an additional million of qualitative adjustments for our energy loan portfolio this amount is down from million as of march in assessing the energy portfolio for the additional qualitative adjustments during the second quarter we updated our borrowing base determinations for nearly all of our energy production loans using current engineering valuations and an oil price deck of in through this process we estimated an aggregate borrowing base deficiency on energy production loans totaling approximately million at june compared to an aggregate borrowing base deficiency of approximately million at march the march estimated aggregate borrowing base deficiency was based on a stress testing exercise using an oil price deck of for and included an analysis of our customers secondary sources of capital management believes that the aggregate borrowing base deficiency amount should serve as the appropriate level of expected credit losses for energy production loans accordingly we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million at june for energy production loans this amount is down from million at march in part due to the rebound in oil prices and the recognition of million of chargeoffs related to three large energy production credit relationships during the second quarter of table of co ntents we performed a separate assessment of other energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics equipment manufacturing and other services among other things business activity among oilfield service firms has experienced significant contraction since march and there are indications of further worsening of conditions due to significant declines in equipment utilization and operating margins furthermore there has been a significant decrease in the number of active oil rigs in texas since march while the aforementioned rebound in oil prices during the second quarter has not had any apparent impact on stemming the decline as a result we expect that the revenues and operating margins of our oilfield services customers will be significantly impacted accordingly we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million for our other nonproduction energy loans portfolio at june this amount is up from million at march in late june we established a special commercial real estate oversight council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our nonowner occupied and construction commercial real estate portfolios due to the adverse economic effects of the covid19 pandemic management believes these portfolios have an elevated level of risk that requires a higher level of oversight particularly as it relates to monitoring risk grades payment deferrals covenant modifications and structuring issues among other things in estimating current expected credit losses as of june we determined that our credit loss models for our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio were overly sensitive to the volatility of the forecasted texas unemployment rate and the forecasted us gdp the modeled loss rate for this portfolio was nearly higher than the modeled loss rate for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio management believes that the loss rates for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio should be similar due to the fact that that the loans within both portfolios are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower this differs from nonowner occupied real estate where the primary repayment source is the cash flow generated by the underlying real estate being financed furthermore our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio have a similar customer base the loans within our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio generally have a longer term than the loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio which increases the modeled loss rate of the portfolio despite the fact that this portfolio generally experiences lower losses in the case of default due to higher collateral valuations relative to the amount of the underlying loans in light of the foregoing management reduced the modeled loss allocation for owner occupied commercial real estate by million as of june of this amount million was reallocated to the nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio and million was reallocated to the commercial real estate construction portfolio additional qualitative adjustments were made for these portfolios as we believe our borrowers ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of assets including those under construction may be impaired for a significant amount of time this would require secondary sources of capital and liquidity to support completed projects access to which may take considerably longer to stabilize than was expected at the time the loans to these borrowers were originally underwritten additionally management reallocated an additional million for specific industries within the commercial real estate portfolio that have been particularly impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic as further discussed below the net effect of these additional qualitative adjustments when combined with the aforementioned qfactor adjustment was an overall negative qualitative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans totaling million the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate aside from the energy industry which is discussed above we lend to customers operating in certain other industries that have been and are expected to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic these industries are presented in the following table and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while ppp loans are excluded outstanding balance at june percentage of total loans excluding ppp loans allocated allowance allocated allowance as a percentage of outstanding balance retail hotelslodging restaurants aviation entertainment total table of co ntents we are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment as of june we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk due to state and nationwide restrictions impacting each of these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million all of which was allocated to commercial real estate loans this amount is up from million at march of which million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans

loans ratio of annualized net chargeoffs to average total loans average total loans excluding ppp loans credit loss expense related to loans increased million during the six months ended june compared to the same period in credit loss expense related to loans during the six months ended june primarily reflects the increase in expected credit losses resulting from a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic and recent volatility in oil prices credit loss expense also reflects the level of net chargeoffs the deterioration of credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio during the first quarter of the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was excluding ppp loans at june compared to at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated using the cecl methodology increased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model the increase reflects the impact of assuming portions of all of these commitments will fund in the future and applying our credit loss modeling processes to such amounts as if such amounts were funded loans previously we only recognized a liability for estimated incurred credit losses on offbalancesheet table of co ntents credit exposures when the borrowers to which such commitments were extended exceeded certain risk grades and had not violated any underlying covenants that would relieve us of any obligation to fund additional amounts under the commitment subsequent to the adoption of asc on january we recognized credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling million during the first six months of to increase the amount of the related allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures to million as of june the increase primarily reflects changes in underlying risk grades and expected utilization of available funds an increase in overall offbalancesheet credit exposures and a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts
