to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets refer to the form 10k for additional information regarding critical accounting policies overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields table o f contents results of operations net income available to common

september and increased million or for the nine months ended september compared to the same respective periods in the decrease during the three months ended september was primarily the result of a million increase in noninterest expense an million increase in credit loss expense and a million increase in income tax expense partly offset by a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income the increase during the nine months ended september was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense a million increase in income tax expense and a million increase in credit loss expense details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below table o f contents net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first nine months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions as of september approximately of our loans had a fixed interest rate while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange the secured overnight financing rate sofr approximately the prime interest rate approximately or the american interbank offered rate ameribor approximately certain other loans are tied to a benchmark developed by bloomberg index services bsby or other indices however such loans do not make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio as of september select

of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate would rise to by the end of and subsequently decrease to by the end of while there can be no such assurance that any increases or decreases in the federal funds rate will occur these projections imply up to a basis point increase in the federal funds rate during the remainder of followed by a basis point decrease in we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment nonetheless our access to and pricing of deposits may be negatively impacted by among other factors periods of higher interest rates which could promote increased competition for deposits including from new financial technology competitors or provide customers with alternative investment options see item quantitative

notice of proposed rulemaking proposing an emergency special assessment to recover losses to the deposit insurance fund dif incurred as a result of recent bank failures and the fdics use of the systemic risk exception to cover certain deposits that were otherwise uninsured under the proposal the special assessment would be based on estimated uninsured deposits as of december excluding the first billion and assessed at a rate of basis points payable over eight quarters beginning in the first quarter of if this rule is made final as it is proposed we expect that we will incur a special assessment of approximately million million after tax based on the proposed rule such amount will be fully expensed in the period the rule is made final which is currently expected to be later in nonetheless the proposal could be changed and the timing of accounting recognition is still under consideration under the proposed rule the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination would be periodically adjusted and the fdic would retain the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis the extent to which any such future assessment will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain other noninterest expense other noninterest expense for the three

which is further discussed below as more fully described in our form 10k we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of september we utilized the moodys analytics september consensus scenario the september consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the september consensus scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the september consensus scenario projections included among other things i us nominal gross domestic product annualized quarterly growth rate of during the remainder of followed by average annualized quarterly growth rates of in and through the end of the forecast period in the third quarter of ii average us unemployment rate of

estate loans a million or increase in commercial and industrial loans and an million or increase in energy loans partly offset by a million or decrease in consumer and other loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans increased to at september from at december the increase was partly related to an increase in the weightedaverage risk grade of passgrade commercial and industrial loans which increased to at september from at december and a million increase in higherrisk grade classified loans classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the impact of the increase in the volume of classified commercial and industrial loans was partly offset by a decrease in the weightedaverage risk grade of such loans from at december to at september the

weightedaverage risk grade of such loans increased from at december to at september commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention increased million while classified commercial real estate loans increased million table o f contents as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys september consensus scenario for our estimated expected credit losses as of september and the moodys december baseline scenario for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qualitative factor or qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon managements judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of september modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately resulting in a million total adjustment compared to at december which resulted in a million total adjustment the increase in the qfactor adjustment percentage as of september was largely related to a generally more negative outlook associated with national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans changes in loan portfolio concentrations changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies changes in risk grades and adverse classifications and the potential for deterioration of collateral values among other things we have also provided additional qualitative adjustments or management overlays as of september as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio qfactor and other qualitative adjustments as of september are detailed in the table below qfactor adjustment model overlays office building overlays downside scenario overlay credit concentration overlays consumer overlay total commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied construction consumer real estate consumer and other total model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effects of risks not captured within our commercial real estate credit loss models these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate loans in the case of our commercial real estate owner occupied loan portfolio we determined a minimum reserve ratio is appropriate to address the effect of the models oversensitivity to positive changes in certain economic variables after analysis and benchmarking against peer bank data we believe the modeled results may be overly optimistic and not appropriately capturing downside risk as such we determined that the appropriate forecasted loss rate for our owneroccupied commercial real estate loan portfolio should be more closely aligned with that of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio in the case of our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios we determined minimum reserve ratios are appropriate as we believe the modeled results are not appropriately capturing the downside risk associated with our borrowers ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of investor real estate and assets currently under construction we believe access to capital may be impaired for a significant amount of time accordingly this would require secondary sources of liquidity and capital to support completed projects that may take considerably longer to stabilize than originally underwritten furthermore rapidly rising interest rates have presented a new emerging risk as most nonowner occupied and construction loans are originated with floating interest rates office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longerterm concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the longterm performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of or worse table o f contents the downside scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation rising interest rates labor shortages disruption in financial markets and global supply chains further oil price volatility and the current or anticipated impact of global warsmilitary conflicts terrorism or other geopolitical events factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior including borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices to determine this qualitative adjustment we use an alternative more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models as of september we used the moodys analytics september s3 alternative scenario downside 90th percentile in modeling expected credit losses using this scenario we also assume each nonclassified loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level the qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense adjusted based upon managements assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature timing and amount management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large concentrated credit losses in recent years management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event the consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral this adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan chargeoff trends as well as those of the general banking industry management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio as of december we provided qualitative adjustments as detailed in the table below further information regarding these qualitative adjustments is provided in our form 10k qfactor adjustment

real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total we recorded a net credit loss expense related to loans totaling million for the nine months ended september while we recorded a net credit loss expense totaling million during the same period in net credit loss expensebenefit for each portfolio segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net chargeoffs have been recognized the net credit loss expense related to loans during the first nine months of primarily reflects an increase in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans primarily related to increases in the minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and construction portfolios the net credit loss expense related to loans during the first nine months of also reflects chargeoff trends related to commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer and other loans primarily related to overdrafts and the additional expected credit losses associated with our consumer real estate and consumer and other loan portfolios the impact of these items was partly offset by a decrease in expected credit losses associated with commercial and industrial loans primarily related to decreases in modeled expected losses and the downside scenario overlay and a decrease in the expected credit losses associated with energy loans primarily related to decreases in modeled expected losses and specific allocations table o f contents the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was at september compared to at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expected credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled million and million at september and december respectively the level of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments underlying risk grades the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio we recognized a net credit loss benefit related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling million during the nine months ended september compared to a net credit loss expense of million during the same period in our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures are further described in our form 10k this methodology was also impacted by the model updates during the first quarter of described in note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report the overall approximate impact of model updates during the first quarter was a million decrease in modeled expected credit losses for offbalancesheet credit exposures though the impact of this decrease was largely offset with a qualitative adjustment similar to the model overlay described above for commercial real estate construction loans capital and liquidity capital shareholders equity totaled billion and billion at september and december respectively sources of capital during the nine months ended september included net income of million million related to stockbased compensation and million in proceeds from stock option exercises uses of capital during the nine months ended september included an other comprehensive loss net of tax of million million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock and million of treasury stock purchases the accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss component of shareholders equity totaled a net aftertax unrealized loss of billion at september compared to a net aftertax unrealized loss of billion at december the increase in the net aftertax unrealized loss was primarily due to a million net aftertax decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale under the basel iii capital rules we have elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital accordingly amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios in connection with the adoption of asc on january we also elected to exclude for a transitional period the effects of credit loss accounting under cecl in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet items see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we paid a quarterly dividend of and per common share during the first second and third quarters of respectively and a quarterly dividend of and per common share during the first second and third quarters of respectively these dividend amounts equate to a common stock dividend payout ratio of and during the first nine months of and respectively our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report stock repurchase plans from time to time our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans in general stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards for additional details see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item unregistered sales of equity securities use of proceeds and issuer purchases of equity securities each included elsewhere in this report in august the inflation reduction act of the ira was enacted among other things the ira imposes a new excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after december by publicly traded us corporations with certain exceptions the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year including pursuant to compensatory arrangements table o f contents liquidity as more fully discussed in our form 10k our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits supplemented by our shortterm and longterm borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization as of september we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of september based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at september we had approximately billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings as needed through repurchase agreements the federal reserve discount window or the federal reserves new bank term funding program btfp the btfp is a new facility established in response to recent liquidity concerns within the banking industry in part due to recent deposit runs that resulted in a few large bank failures the btfp was designed to provide available additional funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors under the program eligible depository institutions can obtain loans of up to one year in length by pledging us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and other qualifying assets as collateral these assets will be valued at par the btfp is intended to eliminate the need for depository institutions to quickly sell their securities when they are experiencing stress on their liquidity since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends at september cullenfrost had liquid assets primarily consisting of cash on deposit at frost bank totaling million accounting standards updates see note accounting standards updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements table o f contents
