operations may constitute forwardlooking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ possibly materially from what is reflected in those forwardlooking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control including the scope and duration of the pandemic actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers clients third parties and us forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events recent developments related to covid19 overview our business has been and continues to be impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of covid19 in march covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the president of the united states efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have included shelterinplace orders the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate as the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature there are many uncertainties related to covid19 including among other things its severity the duration of the outbreak the impact to our customers employees and vendors the impact to the financial services and banking industry and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken or that may yet be taken or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact both economic and healthrelated covid19 has negatively affected and is expected to continue to negatively affect our business financial position and operating results in light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time but it has been and is expected to continue to be material impact on our operations in the state of texas many jurisdictions declared health emergencies the resulting closures andor limited operations of nonessential businesses and related economic disruption have impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers financial services have been identified as a critical infrastructure sector by the department of homeland security accordingly our business remains open to address the issues arising as a result of covid19 and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees we have implemented our business continuity and health emergency response plans among other things significant actions taken under these plans include implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations restricted all nonessential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area after temporarily closing all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to nonemployees except for certain limited cases by appointment only we have reopened our financial center lobbies expanded remoteaccess availability so that nearly all of our workforce has the capability to work from home or other remote locations all activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization notwithstanding the foregoing actions the covid19 outbreak could still among other things greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism particularly among key personnel further limit access to or result in further closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices exacerbate operational technical or securityrelated risks arising from a remote workforce and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders the business and operations of our thirdparty service providers many of whom perform critical services for our business could also be significantly impacted which in turn could impact us as a result we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of covid19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown andor beyond our control impact on our financial position and results of operations our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations the availability of our workforce the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us while its effects continue to materialize the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally this decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers including affected businesses and individuals vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us the national public health crisis arising from the covid19 pandemic and public expectations about it combined with certain preexisting factors including but not limited to international trade disputes inflation risks and oil price volatility could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate the resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions such as the unemployment rate which in turn are likely to impact our borrowers creditworthiness and our ability to make loans see further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned loans and allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion in addition the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis and certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction we lend to customers operating in such industries including energy retailstrip centers hotelslodging restaurants entertainment and commercial real estate among others that have been significantly impacted by covid19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely to help mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments or portions thereof for up to days after days customers may apply for an additional deferral additionally the temporary closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at reopened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing facetoface interaction our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors the potential changes in behaviors driven by covid19 also present heightened liquidity risks for example arising from increased demand for our products and services such as unusually high draws on credit facilities or decreased demand for our products and services such as idiosyncratic or broadbased market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows legislative and regulatory developments recent actions taken by the federal government and the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of covid19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations these actions are further discussed below in an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 the federal reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to effective on march this action by the federal reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of to effective on march our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds as our balance sheet is more asset sensitive our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings the decline in interest rates has already led to new alltime low yields across the us treasury maturity curve in september the federal reserve indicated that it expects to maintain the targeted federal funds rate at current levels until such time that labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the federal open market committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to and is on track to moderately exceed for some time this timeframe is currently expected to last through nonetheless if the federal reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of covid19 overall interest rates will decline further which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin other actions taken by the federal reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by covid19 include expanded reverse repo operations adding liquidity to the banking system restarted quantitative easing lowered the interest rate on the discount window by to reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend introduced and expanded several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity the us government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the covid19 the phase legislation the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act was enacted on march and among other things authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures the phase legislation the families first coronavirus response act was enacted on march and provides for paid sickmedical leave establishes nocost coverage for coronavirus testing expands unemployment benefits expands food assistance and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic among other provisions the phase legislation the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was enacted on march among other provisions the cares act i authorized the secretary of the treasury to make loans loan guarantees and other investments up to billion for assistance to eligible businesses states and municipalities with limited targeted relief for passenger air carriers cargo air carriers and businesses critical to maintaining national security ii created a billion loan program called the paycheck protection program the ppp for loans to small businesses for among other things payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments iii provided certain credits against the personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents iv expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each state and v expanded telehealth services in medicare the phase legislation the paycheck protection program and healthcare enhancement act of the ppphe act was enacted on april among other things the ppphe act provided an additional billion of funding for the ppp of which billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between billion and billion the paycheck protection program flexibility act of the pppf act was enacted in june and modified the ppp as follows i established a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the pppf act and permits an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree ii extended the covered period of the cares act from june to december iii extended the eightweek covered period for expenditures that qualify for forgiveness to the earlier of weeks following loan origination or december iv extended the deferral period for payment of principal interest and fees to the date on which the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the sba v changed requirements such that the borrower must use at least down from of the proceeds of the loan for payroll costs and up to up from for other permitted purposes as a condition to obtaining forgiveness of the loan vi delayed from june to december the date by which employees must be rehired to avoid a reduction in the amount of forgiveness of a loan and creates a rehiring safe harbor that allows businesses to remain eligible for loan forgiveness if they make a goodfaith attempt to rehire employees or hire similarly qualified employees but are unable to do so or are able to document an inability to return to precovid19 levels of business activity due to compliance with social distancing measures and vii allows borrowers to receive both loan forgiveness under the ppp and the payroll tax deferral permitted under the cares act rather than having to choose which of the two would be more advantageous in july the cares act was amended to extend through august the sbas authority to make commitments under the ppp the sbas existing authority had previously expired on june in august president trump signed four executive actions to provide additional covid19 relief the first action authorized the lost wages assistance program lwap which provides for a 400perweek payment to those currently receiving more than a week in unemployment benefits due to disruptions caused by covid19 the lwap perweek payment is retroactive to the week ending august the second executive action extended the moratorium on payments and interest accrual on student loans held by the government until the end of the moratorium was previously set to expire september the third action instructed the department of the treasury and the department of housing and urban development to help provide temporary assistance to renters and homeowners and promote their ability to avoid eviction or foreclosure the fourth executive action allows employers to defer for the period from september through december the employee portion of social security payroll taxes for certain individuals earning less than approximately thousand per year in december the bipartisanbicameral omnibus covid relief deal included as a component of appropriations legislation was enacted to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the covid19 pandemic among other things the legislation includes i payments of for individuals making up to per year ii extension of the federal pandemic unemployment compensation program to include a weekly enhancement in unemployment benefits beginning after december up to march iii a temporary and targeted rental assistance program and extends the eviction moratorium through january iv targeted funding related to transportation education agriculture nutrition and other public health measures and v approximately billion for small business relief including approximately billion for a second round of ppp loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for ppp loans of or less we are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the us government the federal reserve created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by covid19 the programs include among others the paycheck protection program liquidity facility the ppp facility which is intended to extend loans to banks making ppp loans the federal reserve announced extensions through march for several of its lending facilities including the ppp facility that were generally scheduled to expire on or around december as more fully discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion we are currently participating in the ppp as a lender we have not participated in the ppp facility banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets this disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein such impacts could be material furthermore bank regulatory agencies have been and are expected to continue to be very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers especially borrowers as shown during and following the financial crisis of periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations we are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with asc that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of december and and results of operations for each of the years then ended refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february the f orm 10k for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report from time to time we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary none of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and as such the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a income tax rate dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands except for per share amounts results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or diluted per common share in compared to million or diluted per common share in and million or diluted per common share in selected income statement data returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows table start taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent adjustment net interest income credit loss expense noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income preferred stock dividends redemption of preferred stock net income available to common shareholders earnings per common share basic earnings per common share diluted dividends per common share return on average assets return on average common equity average shareholders equity to average assets table end net income available to common shareholders decreased million for compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in credit loss expense a million decrease in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest expense partly offset by a million increase in noninterest income and a million decrease in income tax expense the increase in credit loss expense during resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices the increase in noninterest income during was primarily related to a million net gain on securities transactions net income available to common shareholders for was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our series a preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the series a preferred stock in the first quarter details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during excluding the revenue associated with the million net gain on securities transactions realized during net interest income would have represented of total revenue during net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and increased basis points basis points in each of march june september and december to end the year at during the prime rate decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at during the prime rate decreased basis points in march to

end the year at to during the target range for the federal funds rate decreased basis points in march to zero to where it remained through december as noted in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents the changes in taxableequivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each the comparison between and includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days due to leap year in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period as further discussed below our consolidated average balance sheets

taxableequivalent net interest income included days compared to days for as a result of the leap year the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during to during the decreases in taxableequivalent net interest income and taxableequivalent net interest margin during were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve combined with to a significantly lesser extent decreases in the average volume of taxable securities based on amortized cost and increases in the average volume of interestbearing deposit liabilities the impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve combined with decreases in the average cost of interestbearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds the average volume of interestearning assets for increased billion or compared to the increase in earning assets included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve a billion increase in average loans of which approximately billion related to ppp loans as further discussed below and a

average yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during to during and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points from in to in the average taxableequivalent yields on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities were primarily impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes

taxableequivalent yield on loans was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates in compared to the average volume of loans increased billion or in compared to loans made up approximately of average interestearning assets during compared to during as discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act through december we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans during we recognized million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yield on ppp loans was approximately during compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans as of december we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans most of which is expected to be recognized in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during increasing basis points compared to during the average taxableequivalent yield on securities during was positively impacted by an increase in the relative proportion of higheryielding taxexempt securities to total securities the average yield on taxable securities was during compared to during decreasing basis points while the average yield on tax exempt securities was during compared to during increasing basis points tax exempt securities made up approximately of total average securities during compared to during the average volume of total securities decreased million or during compared to securities made up approximately of average interestearning assets in compared to in the

interestbearing account at the federal reserve during increased billion or compared to interestbearing deposits made up approximately of average interestearning assets during compared to approximately in the increase in the average volume of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve was primarily due to increases in the average volume of

in the volume and relative mix of interestbearing deposits the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits and total deposits was and in compared to and in the average cost of deposits during was impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interestbearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates in april we borrowed an aggregate billion from the federal home loan bank fhlb to provide additional liquidity in light of economic uncertainty and our significant ppp lending volume these advances were subsequently paidoff in may as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary our taxableequivalent net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in compared to in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report our net interest income and net interest margin have been and we currently expect them to continue to be impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the ongoing economic disruption arising from the covid19 pandemic notwithstanding the foregoing our participation in the ppp as discussed above is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposure after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows table start credit loss expense related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total table end credit loss expense in and was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology furthermore credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures was previously reported as a component of other noninterest expense such amounts have been reclassified to credit loss expense to make prior periods comparable to the current presentation see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows table start trust and investment management fees service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions and fees interchange and debit card transaction fees other charges commissions and fees net gain loss on securities transactions other total table end total noninterest income for increased million or compared to excluding million and thousand in net gains on securities transactions during and respectively total noninterest income decreased million or during changes in the various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below trust and investment management fees trust and investment management fee income for increased million or compared to investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees in and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees during was primarily due to increases in investment management fees up million custody fees up thousand and real estate fees up thousand partly offset by a decrease in oil and gas fees down million investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account the increase in investment management fees was related to an increase in the number of accounts as well as higher average equity valuations the fluctuations in real estate fees and custody fees were primarily related to variation in transaction volume oil and gas fees during were impacted by the sharp decline in oil prices in march though the price per barrel of oil as of december has rebounded from recent lows it still remains significantly lower than the price per barrel as of december volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment management fees and other custodial account fees investor concerns related to the uncertain economic outlook arising from the covid19 pandemic caused significant market volatility resulting in significant declines in market valuations particularly among equity securities during the latter part of the first quarter of and the early part of the second quarter of market valuations as of december have rebounded significantly from the recent declines increased market valuations are expected to have a positive impact on trust investment management fees and other custodial account fees at december trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of trust assets fixed income securities of trust assets and cash equivalents of trust assets the estimated fair value of trust assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for decreased million or compared to the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in overdraftinsufficient funds charges on consumer

commissions may be particularly impacted by the effects of temporary furloughs and permanent layoffs the covid19 pandemic has also given rise to a hard insurance market characterized by decreased capacity for most types of insurance coupled with higher premiums and more stringent underwriting standards among insurers this may cause clients to drop or adjust coverage choices as part of expense

the majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans energy loans and real estate loans commercial and industrial loans made up excluding ppp loans and of total loans at december and while energy loans made up excluding ppp loans and of total loans at both december and and real estate loans made up excluding ppp loans and of total loans at december and energy loans include commercial and industrial loans leases and real estate loans to borrowers in the energy industry real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances other than in connection with our making ppp loans as described below it is possible that the effects of covid19 could continue to result in less demand for our loan products loan originationrisk management we have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower the cash flows of borrowers however may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee however some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production energy services and other energy loans which includes private clients transportation and equipment providers manufacturers refiners and traders the origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans because however of the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy production loans are secured by proven developed and producing reserves loan proceeds are used for the development and drilling of additional wells the acquisition of additional production andor the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled our customers in this sector are generally large independent private ownerproducers or large corporate producers these borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions and as such loans in this portfolio are generally greater than million production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower collateral values are determined by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower collateral is calculated at least semiannually using third party engineerprepared reserve studies these reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas to qualify as collateral typically reserves must be proven developed and producing for certain borrowers collateral may include up to proven nonproducing reserves loan commitments are limited to of estimated reserve value cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within of the halflife of the underlying reserves loan commitments generally must also be covered by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at of our base case price assumptions in addition the ratio of the borrowers debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda should generally not exceed oil and gas service transportation and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas we mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment borrowers in this sector are typically privatelyowned middlemarket companies with annual sales of less than million the services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified and include downhole testing and maintenance providing and threading drilling pipe hydraulic fracturing services or equipment seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector our private client portfolio primarily consists of loans to wealthy individuals and their related oil and gas exploration and production entities where the oil and gas producing reserves are not considered to be the primary source of repayment these borrowers and guarantors typically have significant sources of wealth including significant liquid assets andor cash flow from other investments which can fully repay the loans the credit structures of these loans are generally similar to those of energy production loans described above with respect to the valuation of the reserves taken as collateral and the repayment structures although no balances were outstanding at december and in prior years we have had a small portfolio of loans to refiners where our credit involvement with these customers was through purchases of shared national credit syndications these borrowers refine crude oil into gasoline diesel jet fuel asphalt and other petrochemicals and are not dependent on drilling or development all of the borrowers in this portfolio are very large public companies that are important employers in several of our major markets these borrowers for the most part have been longterm customers and we have a strong relationship with these companies and their executive management there is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships we also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil gas other petrochemicals and ethanol these companies are not dependent on drilling or development as a general policy we do not lend to energy traders however we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders backtoback trading as such the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated there is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships ppp loans which we began originating in april are loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act loans covered by the ppp may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments the remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the sba terms of the ppp loans include the following i maximum amount limited to the lesser of million or an amount calculated using a payrollbased formula ii maximum loan term of five years iii interest rate of iv no collateral or personal guarantees are required v no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and vi loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest subject to certain requirements including that no more than of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to nonpayroll costs in return for processing and booking a ppp loan the sba paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan for loans of not more than thousand for loans of more than thousand and less than million and for loans of at least million commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those of real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location within texas this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria as a general rule we avoid financing singlepurpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve in addition management tracks the level of owneroccupied commercial real estate loans versus nonowner occupied loans at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owneroccupied properties with respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by nonowner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies independent appraisal reviews sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project these estimates may be inaccurate construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be precommitted permanent loans from approved longterm lenders sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we originate consumer loans utilizing a computerbased credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers minimizes risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements which include but are not limited to loantovalue limitations collection remedies the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements we maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans decreased million or during compared to our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including i the development and production of oil or natural gas ii providing oil and gas field servicing iii providing energyrelated transportation services iv providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling v refining petrochemicals or vi trading oil gas and related commodities energy loans decreased million or during compared to the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy exceptions to this policy are rarely granted due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base the energy loan portfolio includes participations and purchased shared national credits paycheck protection program ppp loans include loans to businesses and other entities that would otherwise be reported as commercial and industrial loans and to a lesser extent energy loans originated under the guidelines discussed above through december we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans during we recognized million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as yield adjustments and this amount is included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yield on ppp loans was approximately during compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans as of december we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans most of which is expected to be recognized in industry concentrations as of december there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry as segregated by standard industrial classification code sic code in excess of of total loans the largest industry concentration was related to the energy industry which totaled

ten most populated cities in the united states these market areas are also home to a significant number of fortune companies as a result we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business we consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million excluding treasury management

some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need these renewals extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards such borrowers typically request renewals to support their ongoing working capital needs to finance their operations such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally could obtain similar financing from another financial institution in connection with each renewal extension or refinancing we may require a principal reduction adjust the rate of interest andor modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricingstructuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial

resulted from chargeoffs offset by an increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans generally loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due andor management deems the collectibility of the principal andor interest to be in question as well as when required by regulatory requirements once interest accruals are discontinued accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of million totaling million at december this credit relationship was previously reported as nonaccrual with an aggregate balance of million at december nonaccrual energy loans included one credit relationship in excess of million totaling million at december and two credit relationships in excess of million totaling million at december during we charged off million related to energy loans of that amount million related to credit relationships previously reported as nonaccrual as of december nonaccrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities there were no nonaccrual commercial real estate loans in excess of million at december or december there were no restructured loans outstanding at december other than those reported as nonaccrual in the table above restructured loans at december totaled million and consisted of three credit relationships primarily related to commercial real estate foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure writedowns occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses on loans regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines writedowns are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties writedowns of foreclosed assets totaled thousand during and thousand during while there were no writedowns in there were no significant concentrations of any properties to which the aforementioned writedowns relate in any single geographic region accruing past due loans at december increased million compared to december the increase was primarily related to increases in past due commercial and industrial loans up million and to a lesser extent past due energy loans up million and nonconstruction related commercial real estate loans up million potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligors potential operating or financial difficulties management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis at december and we had million and million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the nonaccrual restructured or days past due loan categories at december potential problem loans consisted of eleven credit relationships of the total outstanding balance at december was related to the energy industry was related to the hotellodging industry and was related to the restaurant industry weakness in these organizations operating performance and financial condition among other factors have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits as such all of the loans identified as potential problem loans at december were graded as substandard accrual risk grade certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the adverse effects of covid19 in an effort to mitigate these effects loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments or portions thereof for up to days after days customers may apply for an additional deferral and a small proportion of our customers have requested such an additional deferral in the absence of other intervening factors such shortterm modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to covid19 reported as past due or placed on nonaccrual status provided the loans were not past due or on nonaccrual status prior to the deferral the covid19 pandemic has contributed to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures as a result of the covid19 pandemic a significant number and amount of our loans have experienced ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults we have a significant amount of loans in certain industries that have been particularly impacted these include energy retailstrip centers hotelslodging restaurants entertainment and commercial real estate among others see additional information about the effects of and risks associated with the covid19 pandemic in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion and part i item risk factors elsewhere in this report allowance for credit losses as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans and securities allowances for credit losses are contraasset valuation accounts calculated in accordance with asc that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses cecl on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets for additional information regarding critical accounting policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses loans the table below provides an allocation of the yearend allowance for credit losses on loans by loan portfolio segment however allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments table start post asc adoption on january allocation of allowance commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total percentage of loans in each category to total loans commercial and industrial energy paycheck protection program commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total table end upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the cecl methodology decreased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model fluctuations in the estimated allowances by portfolio segment offset one another for the most part and as a result the overall estimated amount of allowance for credit losses did not significantly change as a result of the change in methodology the manner in which credit loss allowances are allocated to the individual portfolio segments was partly impacted by a change in the way the underlying loans within each segment are pooled for modeling purposes the impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are now a component of the credit loss models applied to each modeling pool in that regard the amounts allocated to the underlying pools of loans within each portfolio segment more directly reflect the economic variables and portfolio stress factors that correlate with credit losses within each portfolio under the prior methodology allocations in excess of those derived from historical loss rates were recognized as an allocation on each of the various portfolios based upon management judgment nonetheless despite fluctuations in the allocation of portions of the overall allowance to the various portfolio segments the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses within the entire loan portfolio the remainder of this discussion focuses on expected credit losses estimated as of december compared to the post asc estimate of expected credit losses as of january the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled million or of total commercial and industrial loans at december increasing thousand or compared to million or of total commercial and industrial loans post asc adoption on

and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis decreased from million post asc adoption on january to million at december the allowance allocated to energy loans totaled million or of total energy loans at december increasing million or compared to million or of total energy loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to energy loans increased million specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual

consumer real estate loans decreased thousand the allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled million or of total consumer loans at december increasing million or compared to million or of total consumer loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to consumer loans decreased thousand as more fully described in note loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of december we utilized the moodys analytics december bl baseline scenario the december bl scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the december bl scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the december bl scenario projections included among other things i us gross domestic product gdp annualized quarterly growth rate of for the fourth quarter of followed by projected annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of approximately to during and to through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of ii a us unemployment rate of in the fourth quarter of and an average projected rate of in and in with the fourth quarter of projected to be texas unemployment rates are projected to be slightly less for those periods and iii an average year treasury rate of in the fourth quarter of increasing to an average projected rate of in and in the december bl scenario also projected average oil prices of per barrel in the fourth quarter of per barrel on average for the year in and per barrel on average for the year in with the fourth quarter of projected to be per barrel the economic forecast used in our initial estimate of expected credit losses under asc on january projected that the texas unemployment rate would remain below through the increases in modeled expected credit losses across all of our loan portfolios as of december compared to the modeled expected credit losses as of our initial adoption of asc on january were primarily the result of changes in our economic forecast particularly forecasts related to unemployment and the gross domestic product as well as changes in portfolio volumes and risk attributes as discussed below the overall loan portfolio excluding ppp loans which are fully guaranteed by the sba increased million or which included a million or increase in commercial real estate loans and a million or increase in consumer real estate loans partly offset by a million or decrease in commercial and industrial loans a million or decrease in energy loans and a million or decrease in consumer and other loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans did not significantly change totaling at december compared to at december commercial and industrial loans graded watch and special mention risk grades and increased million during while classified commercial and industrial loans decreased million classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the weightedaverage risk grade for energy loans increased to at december from at december the increase in the weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a million increase in classified energy loans and a million increase in energy loans graded watch and special mention while pass grade energy loans decreased million the weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increased to at december from at december commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention increased million while classified commercial real estate loans increased million as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys bl baseline scenario for december for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjust the model results based on this scenario for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of december modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately and decreasing from upon the adoption of asc on january as further discussed below the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at december was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions in connection with our assessment of qfactor adjustments for our initial estimate of expected credit losses upon the adoption of asc on january modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately which included a upward adjustment to modeled expected credit losses related to risks associated with model uncertainty this adjustment was based upon the results of certain back testing procedures performed on our credit loss models the qfactor adjustment as of december did not include this additional upward adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty while management believed the adjustment was appropriate given the economic environment prevailing as of january as of december in consideration of the current economic conditions management determined it was more appropriate to apply overlays to certain individual portfolios based upon analysis and management judgement management also made certain other qualitative adjustments for loans within certain industries that are expected to be more significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic and oil price volatility and declines as described below in early march saudi arabia announced significant price discounts on oil which resulted in a sharp decrease in global oil prices including the benchmark wti saudi arabia further announced that it would significantly increase its production leading russia to respond in kind these actions arose in the face of increasing global supplies and decreasing global demand the subsequent worsening global economic outlook and decreased demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic resulted in further decreases in energy prices the wti price per barrel of crude oil was approximately as of december up from per barrel as of march but still down from approximately per barrel as of december in late march we established a special energy oversight council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our energy loan portfolio as of december we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our energy loan portfolio this adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations and a projected oil price deck of for and increasing to for we also perform an analysis of our customers secondary sources of capital through this process at december we estimated an aggregate borrowing base deficiency on energy production loans totaling approximately million management believes that the aggregate borrowing base deficiency amount should serve as the appropriate level of expected credit losses for energy production loans accordingly this resulted in an additional qualitative adjustment of million for energy production loans at december we performed a separate assessment of other energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics equipment manufacturing and other services among other things business activity among oilfield service firms experienced significant contraction during the latter part of the first quarter and through the third quarter business activity increased in the fourth quarter however capital expenditures among oilfield service firms remain depressed there has been a significant decrease in the number of active oil rigs in texas since march though the rate of decline in utilization slowed considerably by the third quarter of relative to the second quarter and the utilization rate saw positive improvement in the fourth quarter of while operating margins within the oilfield services sector have continued to decline the outlook is starting to show improvement based on the level of modeled expected credit losses for this portfolio and the expectation of more stabilized conditions with regard to business activity related to oilfield services we determined that no additional qualitative adjustment for nonproduction energy loans was necessary as of december in late june we established a special commercial real estate oversight council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our nonowner occupied and construction commercial real estate loan portfolios due to the adverse economic effects of the covid19 pandemic management believes these portfolios have an elevated level of risk that requires a higher level of oversight particularly as it relates to monitoring risk grades payment deferrals covenant modifications and structuring issues among other things in estimating current expected credit losses as of december we determined that our credit loss models for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio were overly sensitive to the volatility of the forecasted texas unemployment rate and the forecasted us gdp the modeled loss rate for this portfolio was significantly higher than the modeled loss rate for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio management believes that the loss rates for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio should be similar due to the fact that that the loans within both portfolios are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower this differs from nonowner occupied real estate where the primary repayment source is the cash flow generated by the underlying real estate being financed furthermore our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio have a similar customer base the loans within our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio generally have a longer term than the loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio which increases the modeled loss rate of the portfolio despite the fact that this portfolio generally experiences lower losses in the case of default due to higher collateral valuations relative to the amount of the underlying loans in light of the foregoing management reduced the modeled loss allocation for owner occupied commercial real estate loans by million as of december of this amount million was reallocated to the nonowner occupied commercial real estate and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios additional qualitative adjustments were made for these portfolios as we believe our borrowers ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of assets including those under construction may be impaired for a significant amount of time this would require secondary sources of capital and liquidity to support completed projects access to which may take considerably longer to stabilize than was expected at the time the loans to these borrowers were originally underwritten additionally management reallocated an additional million for specific industries within the commercial real estate loan portfolio and million for these specific industries within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio that have been particularly impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic as further discussed below the net effect of these additional qualitative adjustments when combined with the aforementioned weightedaverage qfactor adjustment was an overall negative qualitative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans totaling million the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate aside from the energy industry which is discussed above we lend to customers operating in certain other industries that have been and are expected to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic these industries are presented in the following table and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while ppp loans are excluded table start outstanding balance at december percentage of total loans excluding ppp loans allocated allowance allocated allowance as a percentage of outstanding balance retailstrip centers hotelslodging restaurants entertainment total table end we are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment as of december we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk due to state and nationwide restrictions impacting each of these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million which for the most part was allocated to commercial real estate loans activity in the

reflects the level of net chargeoffs the deterioration of credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio during the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was excluding ppp loans at december compared to at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated using the cecl methodology increased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model the increase reflects the impact of assuming portions of all of these commitments will fund in the future and applying our credit loss modeling processes to such amounts as if such amounts were funded loans previously we only recognized a liability for estimated incurred credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures when the borrowers to which such commitments were extended exceeded certain risk grades and had not violated any underlying covenants that would relieve us of any obligation to fund additional amounts under the commitment subsequent to the adoption of asc on january we recognized credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling million during to increase the amount of the related allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures to million as of december the increase primarily reflects changes in underlying risk grades and expected utilization of available funds an increase in overall offbalancesheet credit exposures and a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated

ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds the objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost we seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through assetliability management which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future liquid assets include cash interestbearing deposits in banks securities available for sale maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity and federal funds sold and resell agreements liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to frost bank as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs as of december we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of december based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at december we had approximately billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the federal reserve discount window as needed as of december management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or operations in addition management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends at december cullenfrost had liquid assets including cash and resell agreements totaling million impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap gaap presently requires us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs in managements opinion changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including changes in the expected rate of inflation the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities among other things as further discussed in the next section regulatory and economic policies our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities among other things the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits for that reason alone the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on our earnings governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future however we cannot accurately predict the nature timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings accounting standards updates see note accounting standards updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements
