to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets refer to the form 10k for additional information regarding critical accounting policies overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields table of contents results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march selected data for the

basic earnings per common share diluted dividends per common share return on average assets return on average common equity average shareholders equity to average assets net income available to common shareholders decreased million or for the three months ended march compared to the same period in the decrease during the three months ended march was primarily the result of a million increase in noninterest expense which included million related to a special federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance assessment discussed below a million decrease in net interest income and a million increase in credit loss expense partly offset by a million decrease in income tax expense and a million increase in noninterest income details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below table of contents net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first three months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions as of march approximately of our loans had a fixed interest rate while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange the secured overnight financing rate sofr approximately the prime interest rate approximately or the american interbank offered rate ameribor approximately certain other loans are tied to other indices however such loans do not make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio as of march select average market rates for the periods indicated are presented in the

for the federal funds rate would fall to by the end of and subsequently decrease to by the end of while there can be no such assurance that any increases or decreases in the federal funds rate will occur these projections imply up to a basis point decrease in the federal funds rate during the remainder of followed by a basis point decrease in we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment nonetheless our access to and pricing of deposits may be negatively impacted by among other factors periods of higher interest rates which could promote increased competition for deposits including from new financial technology competitors or provide customers with alternative investment options during this most recent higher interest rate cycle we have seen a decrease in our noninterestbearing deposits see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below table of contents the following tables present an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated including average outstanding balances for each major category of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the interest earned or paid on such amounts and the average rate earned or paid on such assets or liabilities respectively the tables also set forth the net interest margin on average total interestearning assets for the same periods for these computations i

the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during the three months ended march excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the three months ended march the decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income during the three months ended march was primarily related to increases in the average costs of interestbearing deposit accounts and repurchase agreements combined with an increase in the average volume of higheryielding time deposit accounts and decreases in the average volumes of taxexempt securities interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and taxable securities among other things the impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volume of and yield on loans and increases in the average yields on interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve taxable securities and to a lesser extent taxexempt securities among other things as a result of the aforementioned fluctuations the taxableequivalent net interest margin increased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended march decreased billion compared to the same period in the decrease in the average volume of interestearning assets during the three months ended march was primarily related to a billion

in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the decrease during the three months ended march was partly related to the reinvestment of amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve into loans balances held at the federal reserve were also impacted by a decrease in customer deposits primarily noninterestbearing the average yield on interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve was during the three months ended march compared to during the same respective period in the average yield on interestbearing deposits during the three months ended march was impacted by higher

interestbearing deposits the average cost of interestbearing deposits and total deposits was and respectively during the three months ended march compared to and respectively during the same period in the average cost of deposits during the comparable periods were impacted by increases in the interest rates we pay on our interestbearing deposit products as a result of an increase in market interest rates our net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment including from new financial technology competitors and the availability of alternative investment options a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report table of contents credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposures after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows three months ended march credit loss expense benefit related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures noninterest income total noninterest income for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in changes in the various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below trust and investment management fees trust and investment management fees increased million or for the three months ended march compared to the same period in investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees for the first three months of and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended march was primarily related to an increase in investment management fees up million investment management fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets the increase in investment management fees during the three months ended march was primarily related to an increase in the average value of assets maintained in accounts the increase in the average value of assets was partly related to higher equity valuations during relative to at march trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of assets fixed income securities of assets alternative investments of assets and cash equivalents of assets the estimated fair value of these assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december and billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in the increase during the three months ended march was primarily related to increases in commercial service charges up million overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts up thousand and thousand respectively and consumer service charges up thousand the increase in commercial service charges during the three months ended march was primarily related to an increase in billable services partly offset by the effect of a higher average earnings credit rate applied to deposits maintained by treasury management customers which resulted in customers paying for less of their services through fees rather than with earnings credits applied to their deposit balances overdraft charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during the three months ended march compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the same period in the increase in overdraft charges during the three months ended march was impacted by increases in the volumes of fee assessed overdrafts relative to in part due to growth in the number of accounts in january the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb proposed to update and narrow certain regulatory exceptions for overdraft credit provided by financial institutions with assets in excess of billion unless eligible for these narrowed exceptions extensions of overdraft credit must adhere to certain regulatory requirements that generally apply to consumer credit products unless the overdraft fee is a small amount below a tobedetermined benchmark or that only recovers applicable costs and losses the extent to which any such proposed changes will impact our future overdraft fee revenues is currently uncertain table of contents insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees for the three months ended march decreased thousand or compared to the same period in the decrease during the three months ended march was primarily the result of decreases in both commission income down thousand and contingent income down thousand the decrease in commission income during the three months ended march was primarily related to a decrease in life insurance commissions and to a lesser extent a decrease in benefit plan commissions partly offset by an increase in commercial lines property and casualty commissions and to a lesser extent an increase in personal lines property and casualty commissions the decrease in life insurance commissions during the three months ended march was primarily due to a decrease in business volume mostly due to a significant transaction in the decrease in benefit plan commissions during the three months ended march was related to premium and exposure rate decreases within the existing customer base as well as a decrease in business volumes the increases in commercial and personal lines property and casualty commissions during the three months ended march were related to increases in the underlying exposure bases and increases in rates and in the case of commercial lines increased business volumes contingent income totaled million during the three months ended march compared to million during the same period in contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to portfolio growth and the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed these performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year this performance related contingent income totaled million and million during the three months ended march and respectively the decrease in performance related contingent income was primarily related to a deterioration of the loss performance of commercial lines insurance policies previously placed and lower growth within the commercial lines portfolio partly due to a tightening of underwriting standards the decrease in contingent income related to our commercial lines portfolio was partly offset by an increase in contingent commissions related to our personal lines portfolio due to improved loss performance contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated andor the subsequent retention of such business this benefit plan related contingent income totaled thousand during the three months ended march compared to thousand during the same period in interchange and card transaction fees interchange fees or swipe fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions interchange and card transaction fees consist of income from debit and credit card usage point of sale income from pinbased card transactions and atm service fees interchange and card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs net interchange and card transaction fees for the three months ended march decreased thousand or compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in network costs a comparison of gross and net interchange and card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below three months ended march income from card transactions atm service fees gross interchange and card transaction fees network costs net interchange and card transaction fees federal reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of  per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction an upward adjustment of no more than cent to an issuers debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraudprevention standards the federal reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product in october the federal reserve issued a proposal under which the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction would be the sum of  per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction furthermore the fraudprevention adjustment would increase from a maximum of cent to  the proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered by the federal reserve from large debit card issuers had the proposed maximum interchange fees been in effect during the reported periods interchange and debit card transaction fees would have been approximately lower in january the federal reserve extended the comment period for this proposal until may the extent to which any such proposed changes in permissible interchange fees will impact our future revenues is currently uncertain table of contents other charges commissions and fees other charges commissions and fees for the three months ended march increased thousand or compared to the same period in the increase was primarily related to increases in income

availableforsale securities with amortized costs totaling billion and realized a net gain of thousand prevailing market conditions provided us an opportunity to sell certain loweryielding securities to enhance our liquidity position and provide us the flexibility to be more opportunistic with the subsequent reinvestment of these funds there were no sales of securities during the three months ended march other noninterest income other noninterest income for the three months ended march increased thousand or compared to the same period in the increase was partly related to increases in

employees the increase in the number of employees was partly related to our investment in organic expansion in various markets salaries and wages during the three months ended march were also impacted to a lesser extent by increases in incentive compensation and commissions we are experiencing a competitive labor market which has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs employee benefits employee benefits expense for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in the increase was primarily related to medicaldental

months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march the increase during the three months ended march was primarily related to an additional accrual related to the special deposit insurance assessment discussed below as more fully discussed in our form 10k during the fourth quarter of we accrued million million after tax related to a special deposit insurance assessment to recover losses to the deposit insurance fund dif incurred as a result of recent bank failures and the fdics use of the systemic risk exception to cover certain deposits that were otherwise uninsured this amount was based on our estimate of the full amount of the assessment at that time in february the fdic notified insured depository institutions that their loss estimate related to the aforementioned bank failures has increased as a result we accrued an additional million million after tax related to an expected update of the special assessment which we expect to receive during the second quarter of this updated assessment is being made under the fdics final rule whereby the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted the fdic has also retained the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment the extent to which any such additional future assessments will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain other noninterest expense other noninterest expense for the three months ended march increased million or compared

origination and risk management processes commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans increased million or from billion at december to billion at march our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes commercial leases and purchased shared national credits sncs energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including i the development and production of oil or natural gas ii providing oil and gas field servicing iii providing energyrelated transportation services iv providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling v refining petrochemicals or vi trading oil gas and related commodities energy loans increased million or from million at december to million at march energy loans are one of our largest industry concentrations totaling of total loans at march down from of total loans at december the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy exceptions to this policy are rarely granted due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base the energy loan portfolio includes participations and sncs purchased shared national credits sncs are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio our purchased snc portfolio totaled million at march decreasing million or from million at december at march of outstanding purchased sncs were related to the construction industry while were related to the energy industry and were related to the real estate management industry the remaining purchased sncs were diversified throughout various other industries with no

reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the

qualitative adjustments decreased million which was primarily due to a decrease in the consumer overlay which is further discussed below as more fully described in our form 10k we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period table of contents in estimating expected credit losses as of march we utilized the moodys analytics march consensus scenario the march consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the march consensus scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the march consensus scenario projections included among other things i us nominal gross domestic product annualized quarterly growth rate of during the remainder of followed by average annualized quarterly growth rates of in and through the end of the forecast period in the first quarter of ii average us unemployment rate of during the remainder of followed by average annualized quarterly rates of in and through the

million or compared to december this increase included a million or increase in commercial real estate loans a million or increase in commercial and industrial loans a million or increase in consumer real estate loans and a million or increase in energy loans partly offset by a million or decrease in consumer and other loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans increased to at march from at december the increase was primarily related to an million increase in higherrisk grade classified loans classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the impact of the increase in the volume of classified commercial and industrial loans was partly offset by a decrease in the weightedaverage risk grade of pass grade commercial and industrial loans which decreased to at march from at december the weightedaverage risk grade for energy loans decreased to at march from at december passgrade energy loans increased million while the weightedaverage risk grade of such loans decreased from at december to at march the decrease in the weightedaverage risk grade on energy loans was also partly the result of a million decrease in classified energy loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increased to at march from at december the increase was primarily related to increases in commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention together up million and an increase in classified commercial real estate loans up million additionally pass grade commercial real estate loans increased million while the weightedaverage risk grade of such loans increased from at december to at march as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys march consensus scenario for our estimated expected credit losses as of march and the moodys december consensus scenario for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qualitative factor or qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon managements judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of march modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately resulting in a million total adjustment compared to at december which resulted in a million total adjustment table of contents we have also provided additional qualitative adjustments or management overlays as of march as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio qfactor and other qualitative adjustments as of march are detailed in the table below qfactor adjustment model overlays office building overlays downside scenario overlay credit concentration overlays consumer overlay total commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied construction consumer real estate consumer and other total model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effects of risks not captured within our commercial real estate credit loss models these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate loans in the case of our commercial real estate owner occupied loan portfolio we determined a minimum reserve ratio is appropriate to address the effect of the models oversensitivity to positive changes in certain economic variables after analysis and benchmarking against peer bank data we believe the modeled results may be overly optimistic and not appropriately capturing downside risk as such we determined that the appropriate forecasted loss rate for our owneroccupied commercial real estate loan portfolio should be more closely aligned with that of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio in the case of our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios we determined minimum reserve ratios are appropriate as we believe the modeled results are not appropriately capturing the downside risk associated with our borrowers ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of investor real estate and assets currently under construction we believe access to capital may be impaired for a significant amount of time accordingly this would require secondary sources of liquidity and capital to support completed projects that may take considerably longer to stabilize than originally underwritten furthermore higher interest rates have presented a new emerging risk as most nonowner occupied and construction loans are originated with floating interest rates office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longerterm concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the longterm performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio these adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate nonowner occupied and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of or worse the downside scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation rising interest rates labor shortages disruption in financial markets and global supply chains further oil price volatility and the current or anticipated impact of global warsmilitary conflicts terrorism or other geopolitical events factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior including borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices to determine this qualitative adjustment we use an alternative more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models as of march we used the moodys analytics september s3 alternative scenario downside 90th percentile in modeling expected credit losses using this scenario we also assume each nonclassified loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level the qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense adjusted based upon managements assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature timing and amount management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large concentrated credit losses in recent years management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event table of contents the consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral this adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan chargeoff trends as well as those of the general banking industry management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio as of december we provided qualitative adjustments as detailed in the table below further information regarding these qualitative adjustments is provided in our form 10k qfactor adjustment model overlays office building overlays downside scenario overlay credit concentration overlays consumer overlay total

segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net chargeoffs have been recognized the net credit loss expense related to loans during the first three months of primarily reflects an increase in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans primarily related to an increase in modeled expected credit losses the net credit loss expense related to loans during the first three months of also reflects chargeoff trends related to commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer real estate and consumer and other loans primarily related to overdrafts and the additional expected credit losses associated with our commercial and industrial loan portfolio which was partly related to increased specific valuation allowances on individually assessed loans the impact of these items was partly offset by a decrease in expected credit losses associated with energy loans primarily related to decreases in modeled expected losses and the overlay for credit concentrations a decrease in the downside scenario overlay related on commercial and industrial loans table of contents primarily due to a decrease in the expected probability of the downside scenario occurring and a decrease in the consumer overlay primarily associated with the model updates discussed in note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was at march compared to at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expected credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled million and million at march and december respectively the level of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments underlying risk grades the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio we recognized a net credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling million during the three months ended march compared to a net credit loss expense of million during the same period in our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures are further described in our form 10k this methodology was also impacted by the model updates during the first quarter of described in note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report the overall approximate impact of model updates during the first quarter was a million increase in modeled expected credit losses for offbalancesheet credit exposures capital and liquidity capital shareholders equity totaled billion and billion at march and december respectively sources of capital during the three months ended march included net income of million million related to stockbased compensation and million in proceeds from stock option exercises uses of capital during the three months ended march included an other comprehensive loss net of tax of million million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock and million of treasury stock purchases the accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss component of shareholders equity totaled a net aftertax unrealized loss of billion at march compared to a net aftertax unrealized loss of billion at december the increase in the net aftertax unrealized loss was primarily due to a million net aftertax decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale under the basel iii capital rules we have elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital accordingly amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios in connection with the adoption of asc on january we also elected to exclude for a transitional period the effects of credit loss accounting under cecl in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet items see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we paid a quarterly dividend of per common share during the first quarter of and a quarterly dividend of per common share during the first quarter of these dividend amounts equate to a common stock dividend payout ratio of and during the first three months of and respectively our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report stock repurchase plans from time to time our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans in general stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and provide management the ability to repurchase shares of our common stock opportunistically in instances where management believes the market price undervalues our company such plans also provide us with the ability to repurchase shares of common stock that can be used to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards in order to mitigate the dilutive effect of such awards for additional details see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds each included elsewhere in this report table of contents liquidity as more fully discussed in our form 10k our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits supplemented by our shortterm and longterm borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization as of march we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of march based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at march we had approximately billion in securities that were available to pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings as needed through repurchase agreements or the federal reserve discount window since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends at march
