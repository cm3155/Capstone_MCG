at september includes million related to the sterling merger and million related to the bend acquisition websters total gross dtas at september also included million and million respectively of federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to the sterling merger and bend acquisition which are subject to annual limitations on utilization the ultimate realization of dtas is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available in making its assessment management considers the companys forecasted future results of operations estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for salt purposes and also applies longerterm growth rate assumptions based on its estimates management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its dtas net of the valuation allowance at september however it is possible that some or all of websters net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the companys forecasts and in turn impact its future results of operations on august the inflation reduction act ira was signed into law the ira includes various tax provisions which are generally effective for tax years beginning on or after january while

noninterest expense allocation methodology was modified to exclude certain overhead and mergerrelated costs that are not directly related to segment performance prior period results of operations have been recast accordingly to reflect the realignment the following is a description of websters three reportable segments and their primary services commercial banking serves corporate customers with more than million of revenues through its commercial real estate business banking capital finance middle market public sector finance sponsor and specialty finance mortgage warehouse lending private banking and treasury management components hsa bank offers a comprehensive consumerdirected healthcare solution that includes hsas health reimbursement arrangements flexible spending accounts and commuter benefits hsas are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings in accordance with applicable laws hsas are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers as well as through national and regional insurance carriers benefit consultants and financial advisors hsa bank deposits provide long duration lowcost funding that is used to minimize the companys use of wholesale funding in support of its loan growth in addition noninterest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income consumer banking serves individual customers and small businesses with less than million of revenues by offering consumer deposits residential mortgages home equity lines secured and unsecured loans debit and credit card products and investment services consumer banking operates a distribution network consisting of banking centers and atms a customer care center and a full range of web and mobilebased banking services primarily throughout southern new england and the new york metro and suburban markets management anticipates that the presentation of consumer bankings operating results in the fourth quarter of will be impacted by a restructuring of the process by which the company offers brokerage investment advisory and certain insurancerelated services to customers the staff providing these services which had previously been employees of webster bank at september will now be employees of a

related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of the borrowers management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it has been determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as contracted commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrowers ability to originate highquality firstmortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency government or private jumbo markets and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans as applicable may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities commercial real estate loans including multifamily are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to determine market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis and policies and procedures are modified or developed as needed

level webster bank originates both qualified mortgage and nonqualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable consumer financial protection bureau cfpb rules allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases increased million or from million at december to million at september primarily due to the initial acl of million and million recorded for pcd and nonpcd loans and leases respectively that were acquired from sterling as well as organic loan growth and commercial portfolio optimization initiatives the establishment of the initial acl for pcd loans and leases is net of million in chargeoffs which were recognized upon completion of the merger in accordance with gaap the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories at september at december  in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate multifamily equipment financing warehouse lending residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology websters acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type credit quality risk ratings andor collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a probability of default pd loss given default lgd and exposure at default ead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework for portfolios using the pdlgdead framework credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio managements pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information loanlevel risk attributes and credit quality indicators the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses the loans amortization schedule and prepayment rates under the loss rate method expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date for each loan segment identified above we apply an expected historical loss trend based on thirdparty loss estimates correlate them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions under the discounted cash flow method expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset our loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections from which we estimate payment collections adjusted for curtailments recovery time pd and lgd websters models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to longterm expectations with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts reversion towards longterm expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years certain models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straightline basis in the third year of the forecast other models use input reversion and revert to the mean of macroeconomic variables in reasonable and supportable forecasts webster incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses qualitative factors are based on our judgement of the company market industry or business specific data including loan trends portfolio segment composition and loan rating or credit scores qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans troubled debt restructures tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset additional information regarding websters acl methodology can be found within note summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements

capacity by either billion with the fhlb or billion with the frb securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally a form of shortterm funding in which the bank sells securities to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back in the future at a fixed price securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled billion and billion at september and december respectively the

risk to meet the financing needs of its customers these transactions include commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit which involve to a varying degree elements of credit risk since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially funded the total commitment amount of billion at september does not necessarily reflect future cash payments webster also enters into commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds as well as low income housing tax credit investments to assist the bank in meeting its responsibilities under the cra the total unfunded commitment for these alternative investments was million at september however the timing of capital calls cannot be reasonably estimated and depending on the nature of the contract the entirety of the capital committed by webster may not be called pension obligations are funded by the company as needed to provide for participant benefit payments as

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations respectively assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risks when determining managements strategy and action to facilitate this interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the alco the primary goal of alco is to manage interest rate risk and to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook its interest rate expectations the portfolio risk position and other factors four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate websters earnings at risk and equity at risk essentially interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate based scenario the flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecasted horizon at september and december the flat rate scenario assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively the federal funds rate target range was at september and at december since interest rates have begun to rise management has incorporated both the down and basis point rate scenarios back into its assessment of interest rate risk as interest rates continue to rise scenarios that include upward and downward shifts of greater magnitude will also be incorporated the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of and basis points might have on websters net interest income over a twelve month period starting at september and december as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates 200bp 100bp 100bp 200bp september december na na asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at september as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger and the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio loans at floors have decreased billion from billion at december to billion at september while loans with floors which are considered in the money have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity as interest rates start to rise these loans will move through their floors and begin to reprice accordingly the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates might have on websters net interest income for the subsequent twelve month period starting at september and december short end of the yield curve long end of the yield curve 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp september december na na these nonparallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to the short end and long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at september as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger as well as the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio and slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the yield curve which in turn extends the duration for mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage loans the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at september and december  in thousands book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change bp bp september assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value december assets na liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na changes in economic value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to webster floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at september and december websters duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets and therefore liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future at september longterm rates have risen by basis points as compared to december this higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities prepayment speeds these earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at september represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action as necessary additional information regarding websters assetliability management process can be found under the section captioned assetliability management and market risk contained in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting estimates the preparation of websters condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto is based on the application of accounting policies the most significant of which can be found within note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained in part i item financial statements and in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on websters financial condition or results of operations websters most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates are those related to the acl on loans and leases and business combinations these critical accounting policies including its underlying estimates are discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within websters loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pdlgdead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables such as unemployment gross domestic product property values and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires webster to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that webster is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problems loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios business combinations the acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or thirdparty valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals particularly the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates credit risk and other relevant factors which are inherently subjective a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the sterling merger can be found within note mergers and acquisitions in the notes to
